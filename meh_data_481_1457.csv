The bag is lightweight, unless you want to carry some bricks around, in which case, it’s not as lightweight (but that’s not the bag’s fault).
Pockets on the waist strap mean your phone is close at hand for that summit selfie.
There’s a place for storing your hydration reservoir (but the reservoir itself isn’t included).
It’s built to carry GoPro cameras. It has mounts for 2 front & back, and a Crushproof, padded compartment for carrying 3 more plus accessories.
Turn on the GoPros in that compartment and record the thrill of what it feels like to be a GoPro in a bag.
Remove the hip belt if you want less bulk, or remove the GoPro foam insert to use the compartment for other things.
It’s a really good bag, GoPro or NoPro.

At $49, this has got to be the most expensive backpack we’ve ever sold. And for that reason it’s not going to be for everyone.
And we don’t just mean if you’re not into GoPro stuff. Because, yes: it has a Go-Pro mount, as well as a padded crushproof compartment to hold 3 GoPros and a bunch of GoPro related gear. But even if you’re not into capturing your various thrill-seeking adventures on video, there’s still plenty of use here. It’s sturdy, lightweight, and features a variety of useful compartments, such as built-in fanny-pack pockets on the waist-belt in which you can stash your phone or anything else you need close at hand.
But yeah: if you just need a backpack that does only what its name implies–a pack to put on your back–then you probably don’t want to spend $49. Not even for one that has mostly 5-star reviews (and nothing lower than a 4) on Amazon…
On Amazon. On… Amazon…
Why does that seem relevant?
Oh, we know: it’s because, while we’re selling it for $49, it actually retails for just north of $100 over there. And so all these people who are saying “Awesome bag” or “I LOVE THIS PACK” or “Bag is amazing” or simply “Perfect”–they’re happy to have spent three-figures on these thing!
They could’ve put that money towards two week’s worth of groceries or a few gas tank’s worth of gas or a few months of internet or a vending machine snack every Monday through Friday for a third of the year, but instead they spent it on a bag. And not only did they not regret it; they LOVED it.
Our point is: it must be a pretty good bag. Our other point is: at least we’re selling it for half as cheap as elsewhere."	0.05			2018-08-20T04:00:03.040Z	0.345231304974333	0.92	70757

Let’s just get right to the basic question here: what is so damn smart about these Smart Stands?
“Smart” has come to be synonymous with “online” or “connected to wifi.” But these Smart Stands are neither. They are an amalgamation of plastic and hinge. There is no voice control or app so you can manage it while you’re on vacation or built-in analytics to tell you how you might best use it in the future, based on your past trends. They just sit there and holds up your tablet or phone.
And maybe in that way they’re the smartest of “smart” products: because they’re smart enough to know what they do well, and also to know what they don’t need to do.
The past is a veritable web of failed innovations. Just like no one wanted pasta from Panera or personal pizzas from Subway, nobody’s pining for some bullshit half-functional beta-level technology to do something that was already extremely simple. Being “smart” is not just creating new complicated functions to prove you can; it’s pausing before you do all the work and asking, “Wait, why are we doing this? Is this actually necessary?”
But you know who didn’t skip that step? Smart Stands. They asked, “Why?” And they said, “Because sometimes you want your tablet to be up like this rather than down like that.” And then they asked, “Should we go further?” And they decided: “No, because the further we go, the more we risk losing our greatest asset, which is that our stands are universally compatible with all phones and tablets.”
See, sometimes intelligence is knowing when to stop and say, “Good enough for me.” Which is why these smart stands are good enough for you, no matter what kind of device you prefer."	0.07			2018-08-19T04:00:02.021Z	0.46941764127665553	0.94	53660			0.024072699552649

Yes, we mentioned the blender bottles sale from a couple Saturdays ago in yesterday’s write-up, but we were mostly talking about the bottles themselves. Today, we’d like to talk about the sale.
See, that sale was an experiment. We offered two choices: a rational number of bottles (the 4-pack) for a good price; or an irrational number of bottles (the 16-pack) for an even better price, with no middle ground. We wanted to know, could we bait you into making a totally ridiculous purchase just by making you feel like you’d gotten a ‘great deal’?
The answer, in a fair number of cases, was ‘yes!’ And so here we are again.
Now, before we get to the product, we need to name this as-of-today recurring sale type. Some ideas:
The Excess Express: Because like an express train, there are few stops between where you should go and the end of the line!
DTB: Does it stand for “Down to buy”? Nope! It’s “Direct to Basement.” Because you don’t need to pretend you’re actually going to use all this stuff! Take one out, deposit the rest downstairs with all the other stuff you thought was a good investment!
Any or Many: Pretty self-explanatory. Other option, along these lines: “More or Less.” Other other option, along these lines: “Deal or Mo’ Deal.”
Irrational Numbers: Are these deals really that much like the mathematical concept of irrational numbers? Yes–because the logic of either is hard to explain–but also no–because only one of them will make you feel smart.
(Also, hello nerds, who are right now gearing up to compose some long screed in the comments about how, well, actually, it’s not that difficult at all to explain irrational numbers!)
Anyway, you can vote on those on today’s poll (and give your own suggestions). Who knows! Maybe if this works, we’ll have a whole spin-off site where do only this kind of deal! Eh?!
As for today’s product, here’s some info: they’re power banks, so it’s not exactly as impractical to have a bunch of them as it was with the blender bottles. Also, we sold something that looks like these before, with the shoe sole pattern, but these are the 6000mAh version, whereas last time they were 9000mAh. On the plus side: that means they’re smaller. On the downside: that means they have less charging capacity (each one can carry enough power to charge the average phone about 3 full times, rather than 4 with the other version).
But really, what’s important is THE DEAL! Because think about: at 2 for $12, that’s $6 per power bank. Not a bad price at all. BUT if you opt for 10, and assume that the first 2 cost $6 each, that means the last 8 cost just $24, or a mere $3 each! And if you go deeper and consider that each of those 8 is rated at 6,000 milliamp hours, that means that you’re only paying $0.0005 per mAh! And $0.0005 is basically nothing, and a lot of nothing is still nothing, therefore, WE’RE PRETTY MUCH GIVING THESE THINGS AWAY!
Okay, maybe we kind of flubbed up the logic there. But the question remains: do you want a boring old 2-pack of Xsories 6000mAh Power Banks for $12 or an amazing 10 for $36?!"	0.07			2018-08-18T04:00:05.333Z	0.3572084668612603	0.93	53049			0.024494294870486415

You probably saw the word “blender” and the word “bottle” and thought, why do I need this thing when I just received my 4 or 16 pack of blender bottles? But the products are actually very different. For example, the blender bottles we sold before were both blenders and bottles, whereas this is a blender that comes with two vessels for blending that are themselves bottles.
Or, to put it differently:
The blender bottles are bottles that can blend things inside the bottle, whereas this is a blender that blend things inside one of the two bottles that come with it (or more than two, if you order more than one blender, in which case, you simply need to multiply the number of blenders you order by two to ascertain the number of bottles, which again, are not blender bottles, but bottles that work with this blender).
But here’s the thing: even if you ordered the blender bottles, you can still order this blender and bottles, because the blender and the blender bottles (not to be confused with the bottles that come with the blender) can be used together (although, obviously, the blender and the bottles it comes with can be used together too). See, blender bottles we sold a couple weeks ago, having only a small metal ball rather than a blade or a motor (like this blender has), aren’t really great at being blenders, but they are good at whisking things (so maybe they should be called ‘whisker bottles,’ although on second thought, maybe not, as that sounds like something altogether different and unappealing).
Point is, you could use the blender–this one, the one with a motor and a blade–for more intense blending jobs, like making a fruit smoothie. Then, you can pour the smoothie from the blender’s blending bottle into a blender bottle and take it with you wherever you’re going, so that you can whisk it back together if it settles.
What we’re saying is that what you should really do is buy this blender and two bottles and then pour the things you make in the blender’s bottles into one of your blender bottles, while using the bottles that come with the blender just for the initial blending.
Unless you didn’t buy the blender bottles. In which case, disregard the above."	0.05			2018-08-17T04:00:10.364Z	0.30912710887561573	0.94	60832

Well, this is a first from our branded content romance novel collection: a teenaged paranormal love story! Please enjoy these excerpts of The Heart Races Until It Rests by Annborny Hilledale.

Ellie met Henri while running.
She was not looking for love. When she’d quit the cheerleading squad to join cross-country, her boyfriend Brad, the quarterback of the school’s football team, dumped her because her running gear didn’t look “as hot.” She was relieved more than anything. She was a senior and she had decisions to make: did she want to go to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Oxford, or one of the other ivy league schools she’d gotten into?
Really, Ellie wanted to got to a small liberal arts school and study poetry, but it wasn’t up to her. Both her mother and her father were founders and CEOs of very powerful companies, and they’d both fought so much about whose company Ellie would eventually take over that they’d gotten a divorce. The only thing they could agree on anymore: Ellie had to study business.
Her Polar Heart Rate Monitor beeped helpfully to let her know her heart rate had risen above her optimal zone. Ellie often ran too fast when she got anxious about the future.
She slowed down, which was when the boy appeared at her side. ‘Appeared’ because Ellie hadn’t seen him approach. “Good day!” he said with a smile. He looked about her age but also–Ellie couldn’t exactly describe it–almost sepia-toned? He wore a strange antiquated cotton shirt and cotton shorts and his shoes appeared old-fashioned, with almost no support. “The name is Henri. I’ve just begun to undertake the task of what I’ve heard referred to as ‘cardiovascular activity’ and I was wondering if you might allow me to accompany you!”
Ellie looked at her Polar Heart Rate Monitor again. Its easy-to-read screen let her know that she’d reached her workout goal for the day. “Sorry. I’m actually just wrapping up.”
Henri looked at his shoes, disappointed. “I understand,” he said.
“But tomorrow,” Ellie heard herself say. She didn’t know why. There was something interesting about him. “I’ll pick you up at your house and we’ll go for a jog. Where do you live?”
“Just past 229 Healy Street.” Something seemed to occur to Henri. “But upon a secondary thought, t’wouldst it be possible to meet right here?”
Ellie agreed. The plan was set.

For all his grandstanding about not understanding ‘cardiovascular activity’ Henri never seemed to get tired. They talked the whole way about classic poetry. Henri was very familiar and spoke about the poets in a funny way. Like with his look, Ellie couldn’t exactly place the strangeness of his tone except to say it seemed that he often spoke as if he knew the poets personally. She chalked it up to an affect, of which Henri had plenty!
“What is that strange jewelry you wear?” he asked at one point.
“This? It’s my Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Its convenient display makes it easy to track my total calories burned per session as well as provide a weekly training summary.”
“Is it expressly designed for this very activity?”
“Nope! It’s great for biking, circuit training, or even just walking. Here do you want to try it on?”
“Oh, that’s not necessary–” Henri started to say, but Ellie had already stopped and slipped it off her wrist. Had this all been a ploy to take his exceedingly pale wrist into her hand? Did she have a growing desire to touch him? Perhaps, but Henri seemed uncomfortable, and they ran the rest of the way in silence.
Later, when she uploaded the data easily to her free profile at polarpersonaltrainer.com by way of her Polar Flowlink, she noticed something odd. The data for her run was there, but around the time she put the watch on Henri, all heart rate readings went blank.
“Huh,” she said. “Must be an issue with the monitor.” But her Polar Heart Rate Monitor had always worked flawlessly before…

It kept happening. Each day, the Polar would continuously display her own heart rate, and when Henri would wear it for the second half of their run–something Ellie insisted on, as a means of testing its functionality–there would be no reading.
But she didn’t know how to tell him something was wrong. Just as they managed to remain in the optimal zone for burning fat thanks to the Heart Rate Monitor, so too did it feel as if they were always in the optimal zone for conversation. She could tell Henri anything and he seemed to understand: about her parents, about her college decision, or about her day at school (from which he was conspicuously absent).
Finally, one day she couldn’t help it.
“Henri,” she said. “I need to tell you something. I’m in love with you.”
“And I need to tell you something,” Henri said. “Ellie, I’m a ghost. The ghost of Henri Olson, a long forgotten poet who died in his teens.”
Ellie should’ve been surprised, but somehow she wasn’t. “So that’s why your heart rate never showed up.”
“Alas!” he cried. “But if it could, it would read a number so high, as just the sight of you sets me aflutter! You see, I have unfinished business, Ellie. I have never felt love.”
“Never?”
“You must understand: it was a different time when I was born. We weren’t worried about heart rates. If we could have such a glorious device as that Polar when I was growing up, it would not measure calories but risk of scarlet fever. In such a dangerous time, can one ever feel true love? I say no, despite writing so many poems about it. But with you Ellie, well I’ve been trying to deny it. To admit so much would be to finish my unfinished business…”
“Just kiss me,” Ellie said. She leaned forward with her eyes closed and their lips met. She tasted no salty sweat on his lips, despite that the Polar Heart Rate Monitor said they’d really been pushing themselves. But of course she wouldn’t. Ghosts didn’t sweat, not even beautiful ones.
In the moment before she could open her eyes, Henri whispered: “Ellie, I love you.”
Ellie found herself alone on the road.

The dean of the English department at the small idyllic Halpern College ushered Ellie into his office. She didn’t wear her Polar Heart Rate Monitor because she was afraid her rapid nervous heartbeat would set off an alarm.
“It’s quite unusual,” the dean said, “for a freshman to win our annual award for gothic poetry, but the imagery you’ve presented–of the final kiss, of riding your bike past his supposed address and finding a graveyard, all of it–it’s just so lovely. Such a wonderful imagination.”
“You could call it that,” Ellie said.
“So I’m pleased to say, as your reward, we will purchase any book for the library in your name. Now, don’t be afraid to take some time to think it over–”
“The Collected Works of Henri Olson.”
The dean cocked his head to the side. “I don’t think I’ve heard of him?”
“He died very young,” Ellie said, pretending to rub her eye to wipe away a tear. “But he–I mean, his poems–they were really quite lovely.”"	0.05			2018-08-16T04:00:03.517Z	0.23418002803322968	0.94	61944

Friends, before reading further, lock your doors, turn on all of the lights, and gather your pets and loved ones tight, because the following is a horror story.
We begin with a young man. Let us give him a name. Let us call him Sean.
This all happened some years ago, when Sean was just a naive young man who believed, due to being brought up in the Northeast within proximity to a certain corporate food chain, that donut shops could be relied upon for iced coffee. It was this misunderstanding that will ultimately lead to our story’s tragic end. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Sean, walking the streets of Seattle on a hot summer afternoon, entered a donut shop–not one of the fancy ones you may have heard of; a small, out-of-the-way place that will remain nameless–and asked the man behind the counter, “Do you have iced coffee?”
The man replied, “Yes, we have iced coffee.” Or no, that’s not it. That’s not it at all. What he said was: “Yes, I can do iced coffee.”
This should’ve been the tell, the sign that something was amiss and Sean should flee that donut shop. But he ignored the portents. He removed a small bill and said, “Great, I’ll have an iced coffee then.”
What happened next is almost too gruesome to put into words.
Almost.
The man behind the counter took a large styrofoam cup, filled it with ice, and proceeded to pour hot coffee from the pot directly over it, handing Sean, to his horror, a lukewarm watery mess.
But do not grieve for Sean. Do not shed one single tear over his ruined attempt to seek cold caffeination. For Sean is a complex protagonist, and he is not without blame here.
Because why was he even seeking to purchase an iced coffee in the first place? Why was he not buying beans in bulk and then using this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Bundle to make his own deliciously smooth and delightfully cheap iced coffee at home? Perhaps, if he had, the day before, loaded up the 1.6 qt. cold brew carafe–or the bottle, which he could’ve carried with him–he might have avoided such a cruel fate.
As is the case with many stories of terror and woe, this is a cautionary tale. Do not, dear reader, make the same mistake Sean made. Buy this bundle and live forever in cold coffee bliss."	0.05			2018-08-15T04:00:09.341Z	0.31881841989687204	0.93	65238

It’s about halfway down the feature bullets to these Medical Forehead and Ear Digital Thermometers that you see this:

“JUST ONE BUTTON to press. No more fear of breaking a glass or swallowing mercury.”

And you’re reminded that there was a time when, in the name of health, we put a glass tube of an extremely dangerous chemical into the mouths of children.
Children.
Children who might heave their favorite toy across the room just to see if it can fly. Children who eat the erasers on the end of a #2 pencil because it looks like gum. They were given a tube made of glass–the most satisfying of all smashables–filled with a weird, perhaps even delicious-looking, red substance.
Kids these days have it easy.
Or do they?
My mom, a nurse, always had a cupboard in the bathroom stocked with the most up-to-date medical paraphernalia. Therefore, we had a digital thermometer from the beginning. It was nice. Like this one, no mercury. Like this one, an easy straightforward digital readout of your temperature. Unlike this one, it took what felt like a half-hour to give a final verdict on whether or not you’d reached that magical realm north of 98.6 and earned the day off from school. And so, it wasn’t uncommon for the temperature-taker to put the thermometer in the child’s mouth and then walk away to take care of something else, allowing the child freedom to manipulate, through a variety of means, the final result.
This is hypothetical, of course. I would never have done such a thing.
(Oh, and also, just an FYI: that whole 98.6 being the average human temperature thing is the result of tests conducted by one doctor using a crummy armpit thermometer in the 19th century and is mostly bullshit.)
These thermometers, meanwhile, can register a temperature in seconds from the mouth or the forehead, thus disallowing for any alteration of results.

On day one, we sold a Roomba. That was in July, 2014. In the last 5 months of that year–our first 5 months of operation–we sold 5 more Roombas. We sold one or two in 2015. Since then, nothing. No more Roombas…
UNTIL TODAY!
What’s the best metaphor to capture the excitement of our reunification? Perhaps we could think of ourselves as a once famous rock band who amicably splintered to pursue our solo careers. We would certainly be the experimental-minded keyboardist, doing avant-guard work with help of speaker docks and vacuum sealers, whereas the Roomba would be the pop-forward frontman, producing hit after hit, each one more-or-less the same.
And now comes our glorious reunion tour!
(Although, now that I think about it, don’t bands usually reunite when the “well has run dry,” so to speak? As in: a last ditch effort to regain their former wealth or reputation?)
How about a different metaphor: in the 2015 we let the Roomba go off to clean, and now, after many years of service to the greater world, it’s made its circuitous way back to Meh, its noble charging port!
Nice pivot, eh?
Anyway, as we implied above, in the time since we last sold a Roomba, there have been, by our estimation, 6,000 new models released, all of which look almost exactly the same. So, if you’re wondering why you should buy this Roomba instead of a different Roomba, we are too.
But here’s what we gathered from these helpful breakdowns over at Vacuum Fanatics: the 805 is basically the base model of iRobot’s higher-end (though not highest end) 800 series of vacuum cleaners. It doesn’t have wi-fi like the 890, so it doesn’t work with Alexa or Google Assistant. Nor does it have the improved sensor capabilities of the 860. But it does have a lot of the other things that make those models great, such as a big bin and an AeroForce High Efficiency Filter, meaning the air that passes through it comes out a lot cleaner (which could be a big deal for allergy sufferers).

When the employees arrived at their first day at the new NOTILUS headquarters, they noticed something strange.
“There is no roof,” one of them said.
“Exactly,” said one of the higher-ups. “It’s an open-roof open-office.”
“But we won’t be protected from the rain,” said another employee.
“Exactly,” the higher-up said again.
The building had tile floors and was equipped with a siren. It sounded whenever a storm approached, at which point, the employees took the tarps provided to them and covered their computers, their phones, anything that could succumb to water damage. Then, they stood. They closed their eyes. They waited for the rain to wash over them so that they could understand it, become one with it.
Thus, when they engineered their shower heads to have 6 settings including “Wide Rainfall” and “Power Rain,” they knew these to be the true to their names. And when they built dual-zone antimicrobial jets that did not clog, it was not only to provide their customers with consistently strong water pressure; it was to mimic the rain that, year after year, never ceased to lessen in its strength.

That sort of thing.

The great philosopher Zaza Pachulia once said: “Nothing easy.” He was referring to the 8th seed Atlanta Hawks forcing a game seven against the 1st seed Boston Celtics, but his words are applicable to so many things in life. For us, there is “nothing easy” about balancing our standards for honest copy with our desire to offer a diverse range of products. Some days, it just seems untenable. And friends, today is one of those days. Because if I gave my 100% honest opinion of this ProCabello Straightener and Styler Kit it would be this:
IDK, it looks good to me, I guess.
See, I don’t actually know. I’ve never used a hair straightener, nor can I foresee a scenario arising in the future where I will either. Then again, this isn’t my first rodeo. There’ve been plenty of products I don’t particularly care about, and when they come up, there’s a simple solution: lean on the Amazon reviews.
Unfortunately this doesn’t help me much here, because the reviews, while positive (and that’s despite the significantly higher price point WITHOUT the “Shine and Hold Spray” we’re including), say very little.
For example, here is Diane Camargo’s review in full:

Love it!! The best flat iron I’ve used

And Karen Tucci writes:

Awesome flat iron. Heats up super fast. Has multiple heat settings. Very happy with my purchase.

And Adrian Blake Hammonds writes:

I love the way my hair feels.

Is it good to see such positive reviews of the item we’re selling? Sure. Do these reviews help me, as a copywriter, find an interesting angle for my write-up? No. Did I include three of them when one would suffice simply to push the write-up further down the page, thus making it appear longer? Of course. Unless it’s @Dave asking, in which case, no way! I did it for integrity!
Really the point is, it’s difficult to write about something without any personal attachment to even the concept of it. That’s why so much copy looks like… well… copy. But that’s not what we want. Likewise, we can’t just sell the stuff we know how to write about. We need to sell items that are outside of our comfort zone sometimes. Are they outside of the greater Meh community’s comfort zone, too? Maybe. Only time (and all of the graphs at the bottom of the page) will tell.

We’ve got another weird item pedaling vague impossible-to-prove pseudo-science, so that means another installment of THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE: a feature wherein we lay out the product’s claims and explain why we’re not so sure we believe them. Here goes!
The Claim
The Pure Daily Care Diffuser is the “ultimate starter pack for essential oil enthusiasts.” The various botanical oils are “100% pure” and also “100% organic” with “no fillers or additives.” All of this is fairly simple. Where it gets more interesting is in laying out the benefits of each included oil:

Peppermint is a “mental stimulant” that “provides energy”;
Orange is a “respiratory stimulator, antiseptic, antidepressant, aphrodisiac, and neural stimulator”;
Tea Tree is a “powerful immune stimulator”;
Lemongrass is “neural stimulator” that “soothes aches and pains while also reducing anxiety”;
Lavender is another “neural stimulator” that “reduces stress and anxiety and promotes restful sleep”;
and Eucalyptus is a “respiratory booster” and is “great for relieving sinus congestions.”

The Skepticism
Perhaps I shouldn’t call myself skeptical here. I’m not skeptical. I think this is bullshit, and moreover, I think it’s pretty dangerous. Not the diffuser itself, but the language.
Because eucalyptus oil will not relieve sinus congestion in a meaningful way. And lemongrass oil isn’t going to help with your sore joints. And orange oil is as much an antidepressant as the two day old styrofoam tub that held raw chicken in the trash is a depressant. By which I mean: walking into a house that smells bad sucks, and therefore will make you feel unhappy; so, conversely, walking into a house that smells good doesn’t suck, thus making you happy by contrast.
This is all to say that if you have sinus issues, or joint pain, or depression, don’t just buy a diffuser. See a doctor.
But again, this is an issue of language, specifically language that makes empty promises. The actual truth is essential oil diffusers are great. They don’t smell as fake and chemical-y as plug-ins. They’re not smokey like incense. It’s kinda cool to watch the mist rise out of them. And this one has 7 neat ambient light settings.
That’s why my wife and I are buying one: not for any medical reasons, but because we just moved into a new house and we want it to smell okay. Even when I forget to take out the trash…
In Conclusion
Diffusers are actually pretty nice, as long as what you’re looking for is a good smell, and not a cure."	0.05			2018-08-08T04:00:06.259Z	0.21768616353254416	0.94	62973

It’s been a while since we’ve been able to dip into our library of branded content romance novels, but luckily, we found one that just happens to involve today’s product. Get ready for a tale of desire and medical emergencies in these excerpts from Gene Harmony’s Love Is A Medicine Best Served At The Appropriate Temperature(s).

People were always asking Dale to open jars because of his amazingly strong arms. And people were also always asking why, when he could so easily be a model, he chose to work at the front desk of a pharmaceuticals lab. “Not everyone wants to be on the runway,” he’d say with a smile of clean white teeth that reinforced his model-like qualities. The real answer, though, was that he’d always had the desire to save lives. Working here, where so many important medications were developed, was the closest he could get.
Dale wasn’t the only one in the lab whose good looks were surprising. Rumor had it that Dr. Liza modeled to pay her way through graduate school on the way to becoming the world’s foremost expert on life-saving drugs. Whether that was true or not, Dale had to admit: she was beautiful. Even now, as she rushed up to the desk in her lab coat, clearly flustered, she looked exquisite.
Dale thought maybe she was coming to flirt, something that happened often, though nothing ever came of it. She was a lauded scientist, after all, and he a lowly receptionist. But flirting was not on the agenda today.
“Can I ask a big favor?” she said. “No one else is available to help and there’s a patient in need of an experimental medication. We have to get to the hospital, so it can be safely administered. Could you give me a ride?”
“No problem,” Dale said, standing.
“But there is a problem,” Dr. Liza said. “It’s a complicated medication, comprised of three very volatile liquids that cannot be combined until the last possible minute before being administered. Also, each substance must be kept within a certain temperature range. If I leave them in their test-tubes, they’ll grow too warm or too cold on the ride over.”
“I have just the thing,” Dale said.

Dale and Dr. Liza carried the four Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs out to his car: three filled with temperature controlled substances, one extra, “Just in case,” Dr. Liza had said.
“We need to be careful with these,” she said now, but it was not an issue at all, given that the Primulas’ contemporary attractive twist-textured design allowed for a secure grip. Not to mention they were splash-resistant! “And you’re sure they’re not contaminated?”
“Absolutely,” said Dale. “It’s very easy to clean the mugs themselves. And I put the lids through my dishwasher at home, on the top rack, where it’s safe for them to go.”
Dale could tell that Dr. Liza, though still nervous, was happy to hear this. And she was even happier when she saw that all four mugs fit into the various front- and back-seat cup-holders of Dale’s modest hatchback. “Like a glove,” she murmured to herself. “Maybe I’ll be okay after all.”
“What’s that?” Dale said.
But Dr. Liza didn’t repeat herself.

They’d left the lab an hour ago. The hospital was only five miles away. Yet, they found themselves only halfway there, stuck in unmoving bumper-to-bumper traffic. The reprieve in Dr. Liza’s anxiety, brought on by the various positive aspects of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs, proved temporary. Out of the corner of his eye, Dale had watched her grow more and more upset–first sitting straight up, then tapping her fingers on the dash and sighing loudly.
When she finally spoke, her voice cracked with fear. “It’s no use. We’re getting nowhere. We need to administer the medication now.”
“But how are we going to do that?” Dale said. “The patient is at the hospital.”
“No, I said we need to go to the hospital so they can administer it safely. The patient isn’t there. Not yet. She’s here. Dale, it’s me.”
“What?!”
“Look at me, Dale,” Dr. Liza said. “You’re going to have to administer the drug that’ll save my life from the disease I’ve kept a secret all these months.”
“But, but…”
“There are no buts about it,” Dr. Liza said. She pointed to one of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs. “See that Primula 20oz Insulated Mug? You told me that–with its double walls, vacuum seal, and triple-layer Copper Cold Technology–it can keep liquids hot for up to 8 hours and cool for 24. It makes sense that you’d have such a mug, because you’re a lot like it. You want to save lives. I’ve seen it in your eyes, and like a giant beautiful man-shaped Primula 20oz Insulated Mug, you keep that desire at the appropriate temperature so that it never dies.”
Dale nodded. She was right. He’d waited his whole life for this. Without a word, he got the empty Primula and carefully mixed the contents from the others together in it. “Now, what do I do?”
“It needs to be applied to my lips,” Dr. Liza said. “But first, it requires vermilion stabilization, meaning it must be applied to a healthy pair of lips, and then transferred from those lips to the taker’s.”
Dale understood what he must do. He gravely opened the easy-open, easy-close lid. It was straw-compatible but he didn’t need one now. He let the liquid touch his lips, and then he leaned over the center console to Dr. Liza…

Dale paced. He held a Primula 20oz Insulated Mug. He had cleaned it and filled it with coffee from the hospital waiting room two hours ago when he arrived, and it was still hot.
Finally, the doctor appeared. “She’s recovering,” he said, “thanks to that experimental drug she made and thanks to your administering of it. Still, to be safe, we’ll give her regular doses of it every four hours.”
“And how will you give it to her?” Dale said, feeling strangely jealous. “Do you have a machine for vermilion stabilization?”
The doctor looked at him, confused.
“You know,” Dale said. “It needs to be applied from healthy lips to the lips of the diseased.”
“It’s taken orally, son,” the doctor said. Then a sly grin came across his face. “If I had to wager a guess, I’d say someone has a crush on you!”"	0.05			2018-08-07T04:00:06.333Z	0.5387061168679262	0.92	64187			0.11531935223472428

“Do not cast your pearls before swine.”
People spoke these words without thinking, for a moment, of how they would hurt me, a pig. But more than speak them, they lived by them. Every time I walked into a jewelry store, they quickly rushed to put away their finest pearls.
I told them, “But it is me. I am not a descendent of some clown like Porky. My grandfather built the first ever wolf-proof house. He patented his  special structurally-sound brick-laying technique, and it has been used in the constructions of homes the country over, including three governors’ mansions.

Then, one day, I saw a New Yorker cartoon. One dog sat on the floor, listening to another, seated at a computer. The caption read: “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” For many, it was simply humorous. For me, it was instructive. I realized this was the easiest way to pearl ownership: the internet.
Since then, I’ve made a point to purchase all pearl and mother of pearl jewelry I see for sale online. Truthfully, I don’t even like pearls that much, but I buy them anyway, just to enjoy the warm feeling of a symbolic victory.
And thus, I will buy these pieces of Pacific Pearls jewelry for sale here today."	0.05			2018-08-06T04:00:07.482Z	0.45153027715749355	0.94	64222

The jewels look pretty much like a silver band from any further than a foot away, which is maybe a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preference.
They make a big deal about how they are designed for the minuscule ears of women, which I thought was just goofy marketing. But I’ll be honest, none of the 5 tip sizes really worked for my brutish masculine ears.
I was, however, able to get some tips from a previous pair onto them (with a little coaxing).
All-in-all, a very solid buy. If I didn’t already have 2 pairs, I’d buy some more as backup.

You get 2 pairs of Maroo ICE Headphones, but when you receive them, you might think you accidentally ordered 8. Because despite their “smaller fit for women’s ears,” these things come in an unnecessarily big and complicated box. User @Chakolate sums it up pretty nicely:

What is a problem is the amount of packaging. The unopened package is 223 grams, of which 11 grams are the actual headphones. They come in a jewelry-type velvet box, which is nestled in a lot of plastic, which is inside a thin cardboard box, which is wrapped in tissue paper. They also include a carry pouch, and a thick little book about how to use them. (Seriously? They’re kidding, right?) The end package is about 8x3x3"", which is absurd for headphones.

And in case you need some idea of how big that actually is, here’s a picture.

For context, the can next to it is 16 ounces. It’s also a delicious hazy New England style IPA as good as any I had back east from the best brewery in Des Moines! (In case anyone from Confluence is reading and wants to give me some swag.)
Now, you’re probably thinking: “All that stuff for some bedazzled earbuds? What a waste!” But you’re not looking at the big picture. All the various packaging materials are not simply for this product; they’re for a bunch of different things we’ve sold over the course of the last year. For example:


You can cut up the plastic casing and put them in your Ray Ban Eyeglasses when one of the lenses breaks.


You can use the jewelry case to hold your Diamond Encrusted Eternal Heart-Shaped Pearl earrings.


You can use the pouches for safe transport of your WWE TeenyMates.


And you can use the tissue paper when you move to wrap the little espresso cups you got to go along with your Nespresso Vertuo.


Because everyone buys every product we sell, right? That’s how this is supposed to work. We put up an item each day, and you, in turn, buy at least one of that item each day, but preferably two or three.
Wait… really? You only buy some things we sell?! So we can’t rely on every user buying every single product?!?!

Four Blender Bottles probably seems like plenty of Blender Bottles. You have your Blender Bottle, your backup Blender Bottle, a Blender Bottle to try weird stuff in, and a Blender Bottle to give away when your friend is like, “Oh, I should get a Blender Bottle like that.”
Sixteen Blender Bottles is probably too many Blender Bottles. Even if you’re very clumsy with your Blender Bottles, or very experimental, or have a lot of friends who want Blender Bottles, you’re still probably going to end up with a few leftover Blender Bottles.
So why should you get sixteen Blender Bottles?
Because it’s possible that this is the best ever deal on Blender Bottles. You’re probably thinking: sixteen Blender Bottles for $49? That’s about $3 per Blender Bottle. Not bad, right? But it gets even better, because really, if four Blender Bottles costs $20, that means you’re really getting twelve Blender Bottles at $29. So you’re looking at a cost of less than $2.50 per Blender Bottle after the initial four Blender Bottles.
(Which, side note, makes for a great conversation starter. The next time you have some friends over just point to the pile of Blender Bottles in the corner–and there will be a pile of them in the corner; you have sixteen of them, after all–and say, “See that Blender Bottle? That Blender Bottle only cost me $2.42.” Just, make sure you point to one of the last twelve Blender Bottles, not one of the first four Blender Bottles, because as we’ve established, those Blender Bottles cost more.)
With savings like that, can you really pass up buying sixteen Blender Bottles?
You can?

The FoodSaver conference room was tense. Nobody knew why the emergency meeting had been called except that it involved “a failure in marketing.”
Finally, Richard, the sixty year old exec who’d sent out the invite, arrived.
“Folks, we’ve got problems,” he said. “Our prized product, the Vacuum Sealing System, is being used for things other than saving food. Which is bad, because that’s our name. One thing they’re using it for is something called ‘Sous vide,’ which I believe is a religion, so we’ll want to be very careful there. But the other thing is–” Richard looked around, and spoke in a hushed tone–“they’re using it for marijuana.”
“They smoke through the machine?” asked Terry, age fifty-two.
“That’s what I thought at first,” Richard said. “But it turns out it’s more for storage and keeping it fresh. Anyway, there’s a whole bunch of people doing it. I found a message board where everyone was snap-chatting about it. The Red Edit.”
“It’s called Reddit,” said the intern, age twenty-one. “It’s the ‘trees’ subreddit.”
“Nope, that’s not it,” said Richard. “It’s definitely not about trees. Your generation wouldn’t understand because your Woodstocks were different. Anyway, we need to cash in on this, and we need to cash in on this NOW. We need a marketing campaign. Something to appeal to the youth.”
“But you just said my generation–”
“Quiet, intern. The adults are talking. Now, let’s spitball a little. What do we got?”
“What if,” said Tony, age fifty-eight, “we do one of those internet pictures and then make it go viral?”
“I like that,” Richard said. “That’s a good plan: a viral internet picture.”
“I’ve seen one particular internet picture,” said Harry, age fifty-eight, “where there’s a man pointing at a butterfly. The man will be labeled, and the butterfly will be labeled, but the man will be saying, ‘Is this a something-other-than-butterfly?’”
“Because it’s labeled as something else,” Richard said.
“No,” said Harry. “I should’ve mentioned that too. He doesn’t call it what it’s labeled, either. He calls it something else. I believe that’s part of the joke.”
“Okay, so,” said Terry, “we label the butterfly ‘FoodSaver’ and the man as ‘consumer’ and he’s asking: ‘Is this a thing for storing my reefer?’”
“Ganja,” said Tony. “Let’s say ‘ganja.’”
“Good catch,” said Richard. “We need to use relevant terms.”
“Also, underneath the question,” said Harry, “it should say, ‘Yes, and you can has it!’”
“That’s with the cat, right?” Richard said.
“No,” Terry said. “Cat says, ‘hang in there.’”
“Well, this has been very productive,” said Richard. “Good work, team. I’ll send this along to the design department. I’ll tell them to redraw the image in case there’s a copyright issue and to get us twelve potential samples by this afternoon.”
“You want the design department to make twelve images in a few hours?” asked the intern.
“Yes,” said Richard.
“But how?”
“They have computers,” Richard said. “It’s easy. And anyway, I don’t tell them how to do their jobs. Until I do. Now, intern, didn’t I put you on a special office sustainability project? I thought you kids love that stuff.”

Yes, there are plenty of people out there who love jewelry, but these days the gift-giving season (at least in our experience) seems to be less about personal affects and more about technological advancement. You don’t get your mom earrings anymore; you get her a tablet. And you don’t get your grandmother a bracelet; you order her a Roku and help set up Netflix so she can watch her shows on an infinite loop without commercial interruption. So who are you buying this jewelry for?
You might not be able to think of anyone… and that’s exactly the point!
You’re forgetting somebody. Or maybe you’re not. Maybe you didn’t even realize Aunt Gilma was coming this year, after what happened at the Easter Parade. Or maybe you didn’t know Cousin Nick was bringing his girlfriend from college, or that he had a girlfriend at all, or that he was in college, and actually the more you think about it, the less you remember even having a cousin Nick. But that doesn’t matter. She’ll be there for the holidays, and come Christmas morning you don’t want her to have to sit awkwardly on the floor among the landscape of shredded wrapping paper with a big pile of nothing to bring home.
And jewelry is the perfect gift in this situation: a nice, attractive, inoffensive, break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option for that special someone in your life… that you totally spaced on.
In other words, it wouldn’t hurt to just have some around this time of year.

Yes, with each day there comes fewer hours of sunlight to warm things up. The numbers you saw on the right in the “low” column have begun their migration left, replacing the previously pleasant “high” temperatures. Thus, this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Maker and travel brewers might, you think, only be used a short time before they go into storage. Because brewing iced coffee in December is like the beverage equivalent of wearing shorts during a blizzard: something done, in states that experience a true winter, only by the extremest of die-hards and season deniers.
As one such person, I can confirm: we are a small, proud, devoted (if not somewhat delusional) group. But we also know a secret that few others seem to understand.
Before I get to that, though, let me clarify. The group I’m talking about is those who drink iced coffee year round. I claim not to know anything about the cold-legged shorts wearers. Although I do wear shorts in the winter months sometimes. For example, if I’m stuck inside and doing something active, like cooking or cleaning.
And this is exactly the secret I’m talking about: winter only happens outside!
Everywhere else, it remains warm enough to drink refreshing smooth cold brew. At home. At work. Even in the car. Actually, especially in the car, after you’ve given it some time to warm up, when it becomes basically a mobile sauna.
What’s funny is that this secret hides in plain sight. Think about it. Do you bake your salads in the winter? Do you pour a bottle of Coca Cola into the kettle and set it to boil? Do you say to the bartender, “I’ll have the IPA, but nuke it on high for 45 seconds”? Sure, a hot toddy, a nice soup, or a steaming mug of hot apple cider is nice. but even in February, these things aren’t as ubiquitous as a glass of cold water and a deli sandwich.
In other words, it’s totally easy to normal to drink cold brew coffee year round. The only tough part is when you walk from the warmth of your car to the warmth of your house or your office with your cold cup in hand.

Alexa can’t rake leaves, and she’s terrible with a leaf blower. Ditto for scraping the frost from your car’s windshield.
You can ask her to help bring the potted plants in from the porch, and she’ll refuse each time, regardless of how polite you are. As if she doesn’t understand SHE works for YOU!
Alexa can tell you the Bolivian city Oruro’s population. She can tell you who serves at its mayor, or what kind of climate it experiences. She can probably tell you its exact coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. But she has no fucking clue where you put your damn sweaters after you moved this past summer.

Using a slow, rotating hot (but not boiling) water bath to cook your food (which itself is sealed inside a plastic bag) will allow for levels of tenderness heretofore unexperienced.

Sous vide cooking is fun. It’s weird. It’s a lot different than most basic cooking methods. And because of that, there are tricks you’re bound to pick up along the way, little ways to improve your food’s flavor, or methods that maybe make it just that much easier.
Still, you’re bound to have some blind spots. Cooking is like having a problem to solve, the problem of how to get all these ingredients into a cohesive “meal.” As such, everyone’s going to come at it from a different angle. And knowing how another person approaches something might help you figure out the best way for you to do things. Thus, by giving your second Power Precision Sous Vide Cooker away to someone you know, you’re basically getting an assistant chef. Or maybe an IRL Youtube tutorial without the terrible five minute intro.

Dearest Martha,
I wish I could say that I miss you. Alas, to suffer only a heavy heart would be a great relief! The truth is much worse than that. I write this letter because I am in grave danger, and I fear that I will suffer not death, but something much worse: a living death of sorts.
Yes, “fear”: a word you likely never thought you would see your husband write. For eight months, I cohabited with wild gorillas. For eleven, I roamed with a pack of wolves. For three, I swam with electric eels. I was buried a whole year among the bulldog ants of Australia in an attempt to understand their tunnel structure. Never once, in any of those cases, did I feel even remotely afraid. But none of them compare to this.
Though it may void my contract with the research firm, I will give you the full details of my current assignment: I was sent to integrate myself into a community of EarPod wearers, so that I might discern once and for all what makes them such incredible assholes.
I have, for the last month, been living among them somewhere in the Bay Area in what I believe is an apartment, but also seems to be a concert venue and startup. The startup is focused on an app of some kind but no one here actually programs. They all work as “organic social marketing disruptors” though many also dabble, I’m told, in graphic design. They wear their EarPods always. And so do I.
This is what I mean by a living death, Martha. Since putting the EarPods in, I have begun to have thoughts that seem not to belong to me. At first it was just, PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT on a constant loop. But as I acclimated, I began to think things like It’s too bad the world isn’t as present as me, or My podcast is better than this one, or What idiot called these EarPods instead of Lil’ Listenies? The other day, I thought once again about them falling out, but this time, it was, If these EarPods fall out, what’s going to keep my head from floating away?
Martha, I am losing it. Or: I am losing myself. So please, come quickly. Unfortunately, I am not sure my exact address, so you will have to fly to San Francisco and look for posters for a show we are hosting, featuring a performance by an artist named Transl8. He does electro-folk, as well as politically-conscious trip-hop.
Also, please bring a pair of Rowkin Bluetooth Earbuds. Just as I needed to take measures in order to avoid the bends when I resurfaced after spending those weeks with the angler fish, so must I do the same now. And those Rowkins are stylish, wireless, and way less obnoxious than EarPods. They should return me to myself in no time.
Make haste.

Screenprint Sunday is back… or is it? Because we’re giving you an option this week: to logo or not to logo. That’s right, you can choose a 6-pack of fleece blankets with the Meh logo, or a 6-pack of fleece blankets with no logo at all.
So, on the one hand, this seems like a smart move for us. Not everyone wants a blanket printed with something, especially not a logo for a deal-a-day site. It can feel like you’re basically an advertisement.
On the other hand, it would be pretty insulting if you chose blank blankets over Meh-printed blankets. It’s the same price, so you’re basically saying, “I’d prefer not to be associated with you.”
On the other other hand, you’re saying you’d prefer not to associate with us every day you choose not to buy something.
On the other other other hand, maybe buying the blank blankets is more insulting, because you’re coming here, seeing what we’re selling, and saying, “We’re willing to take your blankets, but we don’t want to help you out with some free advertising.”
On the other other other other hand, you are paying us, which does help.
On the other other other other other hand, it’s not all about you. Or us. It’s also about what your friends and family members might want. Like, maybe they don’t prefer to use a blanket with a giant Meh logo on it.
On the other other other other other other hand, that leaves more blankets for you!
On the other other other other other other other hand, this is short term thinking. You might enjoy hoarding blankets now, but eventually the thrill will be gone, and you’ll be left with only blankets and no love. And besides, weren’t you just saying how lonely you were?
On the other other other other other other other other hand, no: it was not you who was lonely. It was me, the man with eight hands, six blankets, and no friends.

Think of your favorite Christmas mornings growing up: you woke up after barely sleeping, rushed to the tree, and tore open your presents. Then maybe came some reprieve–maybe you ate some pancakes and drank some hot cocoa–after which the real fun started: you spent the next several hours painstakingly assembling a tiny model from even tinier pieces so that it could sit atop your desk forevermore!
Okay, maybe that wasn’t exactly how it went. Probably, you played video games, or with some new action figures or dolls. Maybe you watched some movies on TV, maybe you ate more pancakes, drank some more cocoa, maybe you didn’t get out of your pajamas until four in the afternoon when it was time for Christmas dinner, and maybe you were ready for bed at seven, the calories and the sporadic sleep from the night before combining into a potent sleep aid.
And I wouldn’t blame you if that’s what you chose to do. Because those things are more enjoyable than building a model. But here’s something to think about: are they as satisfying?
Because there’s an important difference here. Yes, you might enjoy a candy bar more than taking a jog. Yes, you might enjoy bingeing ten seasons of some guilty-pleasure thriller on Netflix more than spending the afternoon preparing a five-course meal for your visiting relatives. And yes, you’re probably going to enjoy sitting around on the couch on Christmas overindulging in food, toys, and TV (or for adults: food, booze, and basketball) more than building the tiny model of the Eiffel Tower that you got in your stocking.
But you won’t be as satisfied.
Anyone who’s ever done anything requiring a modicum of will-power and ingenuity–even if only to solve a minor problem of their own making–knows that the accompanying frustration quickly gives way to a more lasting pride. Every deep breath you take all day will remind you of that jog. For weeks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment after making that meal. And while you might regret all of the pancakes and cocoa and movies and Christmas cookies well before December 26th, you will always be able to look at your model and think, with a smug sense of satisfaction, I did that.
And that is the greatest gift of all.
At least, after all the other, cooler gifts."	0.07			2018-11-03T04:00:03.903Z	0.34069812514025755	0.94	52882

Ah yes, another gummy purporting to have some vague healing properties. Sounds like the perfect starting point for a rousing round of…
THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE
Here’s how it works: we give you the claim the product makes, explain why we’re more than a little dubious, and then in the end, we come to some conclusion (if ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ can be considered a conclusion). Let’s get started!
The Claim
CBD is “a natural constituent of hemp” that “has been shown to have positive health benefits.” But since it contains no THC, it won’t get you high. Thus, it supposedly can help treat stuff like pain and anxiety with less risk of endless philosophizing or nachos.
The Skepticism
Here are pretty much all of the things we can definitively say about CBD:

It is short for cannabidiol.

Did we get all that? Does anyone need anything repeated? In the back? Can you all hear me?
Okay, that’s a simplification. There’s more. For example, we also know that, like Hansel, this CBD shit is just so hot right now. According to a New York Times article by Alex Williams, Willie Nelson is launching a line of CBD-infused coffee beans (two of his favorite things in one cup, he says), Mandy Moore is toying with it to see if it helps relieve the pain of walking in heels, and Glamour magazine ran a story with the headline “I Replaced My Entire Beauty Routine With Only CBD Products.” I am linking it here as proof. I refuse to actually read it, which I consider an act of self-care.
But what does it actually… do? Gabe Kennedy a twentysomething CBD start-up founder offers this:

Comparing it to the feeling after an intense meditation or yoga session, Mr. Kennedy added that the CBD glow has “synergistic downstream effects” in terms of social connections. “Around others, I find myself more present and attentive, more creative and open.”

To put my reaction in terms that Mr. Kennedy’s ilk would understand, I’d say the ROI on reading that paragraph was that I experienced an exciting disruption in the mouth sector, which, had I not cupped my hand over my lips, might just have gone viral all over my keyboard.
But while it’s fun to mock the eye-roll parade that the article provides, it also validates the claim made by Christie Aschwanden over at FiveThirtyEight: “the marketing has gotten way ahead of the science.”
Aschwanden is definitely more focused on the what than the why. Her article’s thesis is pretty well summed up by its headline: “Does CBD Really Do Anything?” There are definitely some serious WTF moments in here too. For example, when CBD-pedaling doctor Joe Cohen makes the claim that it has anti-cancer properties and might even help with Alzheimers, Aschwanden raises concern that these effects weren’t discussed in two of the most significant cannabis-focused reports out there. The good doctor’s reply: “I think you just have to Google search it.”
Moreover, though, she raises some important points, most notably that we don’t have mixed messages when it comes to CBD; we have almost no messages at all, because very few tests have looked at it on its own:

Animal models and a few human studies suggest that CBD can help with anxiety, but those are the only conditions with much research on CBD in isolation.

Otherwise, most studies focus on cannabinoids more generally, where they have actually found “‘conclusive or substantial evidence’ supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain in adults, multiple sclerosis-related spasticity (a kind of stiffness and muscle spasms), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”
Though, this assumes you’re getting a real dose, which also seems to be up in the air:

There are no guarantees that the label accurately reflects what’s in the product. For a 2015 study published in JAMA, researchers tested 75 products [cannabis] purchased in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle and found that only 17 percent were accurately labeled. More than half of the products contained significantly lower levels of cannabinoids than the label promised, and some of them contained only negligible amounts of the compounds.

The Conclusion
When we promise something here, we hold ourselves to it, so here comes: after reading about CBD, we can say, conclusively, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . But actually, it seems not to be super risky and to have some potentially great outcomes. So if you’re feeling anxious or a little achy, give it a try. Like most of this stuff, if you don’t think of it as a cure-all, you should be fine."	0.06			2018-11-02T04:00:05.893Z	0.42612956253890216	0.93	66292

It’s easy to come up with jokes about these things, and not just because they’re called “Lovesac Sactionals.” Like, imagine replacing all of a friend’s furniture with these one night, so they awake and believe they’ve grown. Or imagine a business man who uses them in his office as a power move, so that whenever someone comes to meet with him, they have to sit crouched to the ground feeling small.
But really, this hilarious world I’m describing, where everything is out of proportion is actually what young kids experience all the time, just inverted.
As @Superllama7 helpfully points out, “kids and pets can also use adult-sized furniture.” This is true, of course. Yet adult-sized furniture doesn’t really give kids a sense of ownership. Kids have toys and books. They have a bedroom they might share, and a bed to sleep in. But rarely are they given their own little space for quiet comfort in daytime, which is too bad, because it’s something they might like.
@2palms’s daughter did, at least: “with the double-wide seat she can get a leg up, then camp out in the corner with her books.” If that sounds super cute, I’ve got news for you: it is. @2palms includes two adorable pictures of “quiet morning reading time” on one of the 2 “chaise lounges” they put together. (@2palms elsewhere describes the Sactional furniture’s sturdiness, in case that’s a concern).
We should add that this time around, we’re selling them a bit differently than we did in September. Instead of doing it piece-by-piece, we’re offering a few different packages. You can get:

That’s ridiculous, Lucy. It’s 2018; you need furniture for casual get-togethers.
8 seats, 10 sides: Basically everything you need to build a simple playpen, except one that’s softer and won’t raise the ire of your interior decorator friends.
Are they incredibly practical? Probably not. But they’re nice, and who knows, maybe your kids have been jonesing for a little quiet, relaxing space to call their own."	0.05			2018-11-01T04:00:05.247Z	0.27079811590159353	0.91	64234

Ladies and gentleman, friends and enemies, lovers and fighters, today we offer you something incredible: control of our most essential invisible resource, the very air we breath.
Birds? They are mere riders of the sky, nothing more than hangers-on. Airplanes? For all of their ingenuity, their undeniable feats of engineering, they still must heed the air’s wishes. When the air says, I shall have a massive storm here, in your flight path, does the plane puff out its chest and cry, Not today, air! Your storm can wait? No! The plane says, Ah, yes sir, yes sir, whatever you prefer, air! We shall find a new way to where we are going! And if the air says, The storm will be massive; there is nowhere to go, the plane replies with a nervous laugh, and says, Of course, sir! Totally understandable, sir! Take your time, sir! We will be right down here on the ground if you need us, sir!
In other words, birds are nihilists and planes are weak-willed.
You are neither.
The air might find its way through some unseen passageway into your house in the dead of night, at the height of winter. And it may say to you, Behold my dryness! It may say, Watch, as your knuckles fissure and grow red! Watch as your skin flakes! Watch as your lips chap, even in here, where you thought you were safe from my wrath! It will cackle with bitter delight as it watches you apply lotion and balm, knowing they are like cheap bandaids in the shadow of its vengeance.
Then the air will feel something itself, a chill. But more than that: it will feel the slow in-creep of moisture. It will say, Is there some glitch in your heating and cooling system? And you will point to your Pure Enrichment Cool Mist Humidifier, and you will say, “No, there is no glitch at all.” Then you will say, “Now dance, air!” And it will cry tears of humidity, but it will dance!

I, Clive Grunley, am not a mere athlete. Nor a biathlete. Nor a triathlete or anything so simple. No sir, I am a sexdecathlete, if you know what I mean!
What I mean is I compete in competitions comprising of sixteen distinct athletic feats. Why do you look so surprised? Did you think a sexdecathlete was something else?
A traditional sexdecathlon begins with a twenty mile run (1). Next, is a swim of at least 4 miles (2), but additional miles can be swum to earn tokens which can be used to hire additional bridge builders to help you build the bridge (3) back over the body of water you just swam across.
After that comes the javelin toss (4), followed by a short sprint (5), in order so that you can catch the same javelin you just tossed (6), and then, while holding it aloft, discuss with several gifted undergraduates how the javelin can serve, in literature, as a metaphor for one’s ascension and subsequent decline (7).
This is followed by a water break, which is not a break as in a moment of reprieve, but another event wherein each competitor builds a mold, pours water into it, freezes it, and then breaks the sculpture upon the shoulder of a competitor before they have one broken over theirs (8). Those who lose are disqualified, and given a strong handshake by those continuing on (9).
Next, you chop down a tree (10), then climb at least halfway up the tree (11), and carve some part of the three into a surfboard (12) while it is falling, so that you have something to ride when your tree eventually lands in the wave pool. You then ride a wave (13) to the artificial “shore” wherein a meeting ensues among remaining competitors as to how you might maintain the tree-related events while also promoting sustainability (14).
Which leaves nothing to do but cross the finish line (15) and exchange high fives (16). Yes, these count as events, as the finish line is a moat filled with poisonous snakes and we call them high fives because they must be completed atop a nearby mountain of you and your high-fiving partner’s choosing.
Anyway, the point being: after a long sexdecathlon, I’m beat. And I need at least three Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Packs to sooth my aches. I especially like that the texture provided by the ceramic beads allows for a nice massage. And let me tell you, us sexdecathletes might all be different, but every one of us likes a good rub!

Four truths and three lies about the artist Adam Koford:


Adam Koford, as a shirt designer often under the moniker of “Apelad”, has sold more than 260 designs on websites like Shirt.Woot, including several that this former Woot copywriter often still thinks of and laughs aloud.


Adam Koford’s art studio is in a house boat currently floating in international waters, the only place he can execute his diabolical pencil hold without being taken into police custody.


Adam Koford was, for a time, a jockey. He and his horse Maple Syrup were dominant, winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. On the track of the Belmont Stakes, though, disaster struck. Just feet from the finish line, Maple Syrup collapsed in a cloud of gray smoke, at which point it was discovered Maple Syrup was not a horse at all, but a robot powered, at its center, by a tiny car driving on a tiny treadmill.


Adam Koford is the creator of Laugh-Out-Loud Cats, a webcomic which can be viewed at HOBOTOPIA.com, as well as in a new book, One More For The Road, COMING SOON (stay tuned to Hobotopia for an official announcement in a couple weeks). A few months ago, he posted his 3000th Laugh-Out-Loud cats drawing. And since pictures are each worth a thousand words, that means Koford has produced the equivalent of 3 million words, the equivalent of somewhere between 30 and 50 novels. That’s impressive!


Adam Koford opens bananas by making several exacting surgical incisions with a scalpel. The peel-removal process can take up to two hours, but according to Koford, it’s worth it. “If you respect the fruit,” he says, “it will in turn respect you by unlocking heretofore hidden flavors.”


Adam Koford has worked as a senior writer and story artist on the video game versions of Bolt, Toy Story 3, and Cars 2. Which means he can say things like, “I wrote Toy Story 3,” and not technically be lying!


Adam Koford designed today’s shirt.

Many considered A Portal Among The Pages, published in 1978, to be the book that marked science fiction author Hal Pembry’s ascension from merely great into the canon. His previous seven novels to that point had been entertaining and thought-provoking, but few managed to evoke the magic that Portal  seemed to achieve so easily. As one reviewer wrote, “When Finley [the book’s protagonist] first finds the Encyclopedia of Time, he does not know that it functions essentially as a time machine, yet he senses something special between the covers. Readers might find this sensation quite relatable, as they sit in their favorite chair, holding Pembry’s masterwork aloft.”
His fans were eager to see what he would come up with next. And they were profoundly disappointed when the answer turned out to be: nothing. Pembry never wrote another book. In fact, he disappeared altogether. Many assumed he’d gone the way of other successful literary eccentrics–that the fame had been too much for him and so he’d retired somewhere quiet for a life of seclusion. Others posited that the terrible film adaptation had driven him to flee out of embarrassment. A small faction of particularly conspiracy-minded fans put forward a theory of murder at the hands of Kyle Tolliver, a rival author driven mad by jealousy because his own stellar novel’s release had been eclipsed by Portal (this being a pun many newspapers made while discussing the books’ relative sales, as Tolliver’s concerned a deadly solar eclipse).
None of these theories came close to the truth. In actuality, Pembry’s novel was a confession of what was to come: he’d discovered a way in which he could, through literature, bend time. I know because he told me when I spotted him last week outside of a used bookstore in Omaha. He did not look a day older than his author photo from forty years ago.
I asked what he thought of life in our current age and he said, “It’s okay. There are many things that science fiction foresaw, only different in minor ways. There are robots that work for you, but the one’s that move have no personality, and the ones with personality don’t move. They live in speakers and phones. And then there’s that.”
He pointed to the GOTRAX Hoverfly ECO Hover Board I had ridden up on.
“I’ve read all about those. About how their electrical safety is certified, about how they can go nearly 8 miles per hour and up to 12 miles distance before needing a charge. It’s truly a work of ingenuity. Only, when I and many of my contemporaries had imagined hover-vehicles, I thought they would truly hover. Again, it’s not that I’m unimpressed. Sometimes, I wish there was just a bit more whimsy. At any rate, I ought to be going.”
I asked him where and he corrected me. “It’s when,” he said, then told me to name a year. 1919 was what came to mind, and he took out a small unmarked book from his blazer pocket, opened it to a specific page somewhere in the middle. “Ah,” he said. “Interesting.” He pointed to a line written on the page. I tried to lean over and see but in that moment, there came a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew, Pembry was gone."	0.05			2018-10-26T04:00:03.801Z	0.24495605686952773	0.93	63926

We all have our preferences when it comes to luggage. Some of us prefer the hard-sided rolling bag. We like that what we see is what we get, that its shape remains steadfast always. We find comfort in knowing that our things will be safe inside. Perhaps we go on a vacation and buy a commemorative glass; with our hard-sided luggage we can be sure that it will be safe, as long as you don’t pack it too loosely. You don’t have to worry about some other bag in the cargo crushing it.
Others of us prefer the duffel. It’s casual but also classic. It can go down the street to the gym, or across the world to Shanghai. If you don’t have much to pack, it’ll take up less space. You can pack lightly or overpack a little bit. Its soft sides are forgiving. Also: they’re malleable. Pack one full of clothes, and you can squeeze it almost anywhere. It’s like a firmer pillow.
And yet…
There are times when we wish our hard-sided luggage had just a little bit more give to fit in the tight space behind the passenger seat of a fully packed car. And there are times when we’d like trust our duffel to hold its shape just a little bit more. For example, when we travel to wine country in Oregon, we want to bring back a bottle of wine, not a bag full of wet wine-scented clothing and some decorative shards of glass.
In other words: when it comes to bag-style our preference is not as firm as we might think. And facing this knowledge, it quickly becomes clear that the options aren’t hard-sided or duffel. They’re:

We can refuse to choose. We can eschew bags altogether. We can wear all of the clothes we want to bring on a given trip, layered over each other. The top layer can be pair of cargo pants and a hoodie with a big pouch. In the pockets: our toiletries, our travel knickknacks, our phones, etc.

Or…

We can choose both. As in, we can buy one of each: a U.S. Polo hard-sided bag, and a U.S. Polo rolling duffel. If we’re going for ten days at the vase expo, we can bring the hard-sided luggage. If we’re driving across the country and want something that’s easy to roll in and out of motels every night, we can take the duffel. But with both, we always have what you need.

Okay, fine. This is manipulative. If you really want to buy just one or the other, that’s fine too… But know this: some day, you might regret that choice–some day, you might need those hard sides or that soft top–and when that day comes, we won’t be able to help you.

There’s a double-standard here. If you buy a shirt that’s slimming and shave every day because your facial hair comes in patchy or comb your hair a certain way that looks best with your face-shape, it wouldn’t be considered inauthentic. If anything, it’s the opposite. It shows an intelligence, an understanding of what you have and what works best. Because none of those things are harmful or uncomfortable or particularly time-consuming. They’re just simple steps you take to look your best.
On the other hand, if you try to slow the thinning of your hair–or at least slow the appearance of your hair thinning–that’s considered inauthentic. It’s mocked. Men are told that going bald is embarrassing, but also that covering up baldness is embarrassing. Because it exhibits some denial of reality, a fight against what nature has intended for you.
To which, we reply: Yeah, no shit! And there’s nothing wrong with that!
Maybe at some point, we can all wear ponchos, choosing between three or four each morning based solely on thickness of material. Those who are not going bald will stop cutting their hair, and those who are going bald will allow their hair to recede without ridicule. We will all stop showering, and we will all stop brushing our teeth, and we will cease complaining about the natural odors of our bodies and breath. And if some lose their teeth because theirs are weak, they will drink only nutritional juice of a greenish-brown color, and no one will judge them for it.
Until then, we just gotta do what we gotta do to look whatever way feels best. And if that’s using a hair fiber and locking spray, so be it.
(And P.S., yes: given that we have out spoken against pseudo-science in the past, we did give a healthy amount of side-eye to the marketing copy that claims, “negatively charged Moroccan cotton fibers adhere to positively charged individual strands of natural human hair at the root for a noticeably fuller look.” But here’s the thing: there’s a difference in how harmful it is to say some fibers make your head look nice versus claiming an aligned chakra is the best arthritis medicine, so we’ll let it slide.)"	0.05			2018-10-23T04:00:01.475Z	0.3256555514094781	0.94	62467			0.10346348247905289

“It’s not them either,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s certainly dolls and stuffed toys,” the exorcist proclaimed. “Raggedy Annes and Andys, sock monkeys, and teddy bears, all singing ironic songs of friendship while stalking your every move, each brandishing pencils sharpened into shivs.”
“Actually,” the toy seller said, “it’s fidget spinners.”
“Wait, what? Fidget spinners? Seriously?”
“I’m afraid it’s very serious,” the toy seller said. “They just won’t stop… spinning.”
“That’s it,” the exorcist said. “They’re just spinning? Like fidget spinners do? But on their own?”
“Exactly! And I have work to do! But I can’t anything done! Because I’m so distracted by their infernal noises! Some of them even glow!”
The exorcist nodded. “I understand. They glow brightly with the spirits of the dead.”
“Nope,” the toy seller said. “They’re just the LED kind. And they don’t all glow very brightly. They’re pretty hit-or-miss, to be honest. A lot of them are fine, but the lights on some are dim, or out entirely. That’s why we’re selling them for cheaper than the non-LED ones.”
“Okay,” the exorcist said. “I think I know what to do. But I’ll need absolute privacy while I carry out the… um… exorcism. And I’m sorry to say, I’ll need to take the fidget spinners with me. To… ensure they don’t get possessed again or whatever.”
The toy seller did not object. In fact, he hugged him and thanked him with tears and his eyes. The exorcist assured him it would all be okay.

Welcome to everyone’s favorite day: Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, wherein we offer a new shirt or whatever every Sunday until, eventually, we get lazy or forget and it ends! Today’s shirt requires a little more explanation than the others. Basically, it’s the Casemates launch shirt, on royal blue… BUT you get a choice: the original sketchy version of the logo (and that’s sketchy as in sketch-like; not like, “it can’t be trusted”) or a new exciting more geometric-looking logo!
That leaves you with four potential purchase choices:
You Purchase The Classic Design
This the option for people who respect tradition. You want a shirt you can wear each night when you return to your victorian home and settle into your bergère chair to re-read Don Quixote. What’s that playing in the background? Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16, of course. And what’s that you’re drinking? Maybe a glass of 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir, or maybe a Boulevardier cocktail that you’ve been antiquing for a few days in a mason jar in the fridge. It all goes just smashingly with your new (or should we say old?) Casemates shirt!
You Purchase The New Design
Here, we have the modern choice. You’ll look right at home wearing this when you pull your electric car into the driveway of your house, a recent construction comprised, it appears, of only the most jagged of edges. Inside, you’ll ask your digital assistant to play the latest release from your favorite musician, a masked individual from a country far away who makes electronic music that is one step removed from the dial-up modem noise. Then you’ll settle in to read a collection of experimental prose poetry while sitting on a piece of brutalist furniture that might be a couch but also might be an end table; you can’t remember. What you are sure of: how comfortable you feel in your exciting new Casemates shirt!
You Purchase Both
This one goes out to all those who toe the line between classic and modern. You like mid-century modern furniture. You listen to blue-grass covers of new wave songs and new wave covers of blue-grass songs. In short, you appreciate all things: from the old and traditional to the new and innovative. If we may be so bold: this is definitely the best choice.
You Purchase Neither
This choice, on the other hand… well, it’s not really a choice at all. It’s the absence of one. You’ve essentially chosen not to choose. To put it bluntly, you are empty. You see stories about rescue dogs on Facebook and feel nothing. you stand directly in front of the elevator doors waiting for them to open, not because you’re in a rush, not because you think you’re better than other people, but because you haven’t thought at all. Often, you feel as though you’ve forgotten something. Your phone? No. It’s in your pocket. Your wallet? No. That’s there too. Your keys? No again. Really, you have forgotten nothing; instead, what you’re experiencing is the sensation of your being crying out to fill the hole where a soul should be.

Still, what annoys me isn’t the how clear it is that this product was definitely named by some old dude thinking he’d discovered a new way to “reach the youth.” It had to be, by the way, because, say what you will about millennials, they at least know what a selfie is, and a photo that you need a drone’s angle to capture is not a selfie; it’s a photo with you in it. There’s a difference.
What annoys me is how reductive it is. It’s a dumb marketing 101. It thinks it’s carved out some entirely new lane in the drone game by catering to the selfie-obsessed among us, without taking into account the large number of people that it would turn off. Like, there are probably folks who arrived at the site today, read the product name, and said, “oh, no way,” and navigated away without reading another word. Or even if they did get further, they might still be thinking, It could be cool… but cool enough to risk my friends seeing a box that says “Selfie Drone” on it in the week before the recycling gets picked up?

Dear iRobot,
You’ve done what many companies aspire to do, but few actually achieve. In this stratosphere of success, your company is elite: Xerox, Kleenex, Ping Pong. Your product’s name–the Roomba–is now synonymous with (or maybe even supersedes) the “robot vacuum cleaner.” Congratulations.
And many of us here at Meh have been along for the ride since nearly day one. Yet, there’s something that’s frustrated us over the years: every time we sell a Roomba, we realize the model is slightly different than the previous one, despite looking almost exactly the same. We then dive into hours of research, hoping to solve the mystery of what’s so different in order to help our customers make an informed purchasing decision–only to find, in the end,  something trivial, like the canister capacity being one tenth of a percent larger than before.
What we’re saying here, iRobot, is: help us. Or, help us help you. Why not give every  new Roomba a feature that really STANDS OUT, so that they can be easily differentiated?
For example:


You could make one that says “sorry” whenever it bumps into a wall. An another that cries out in pain whenever it bumps into a wall. And another that recites a poem by Robert Frost in a Mike Tyson accent whenever it bumps into a wall.


Or a model that kisses your ankles when it goes by so that you know it loves you.


How about a Roomba that can take all the crumbs from the kitchen floor and forms them into new snacks for you to serve at your next party?


Maybe one Roomba could feature “pie warmth and texture.” And then the ""Plus ""version of that model could also feature “pie flavor.” And it could just be a pie.


Or what about a Roomba that just came with one completely functional human finger? Is that too much to ask?


Look, iRobot: the sensors, the 3-Stage Cleaning System, the ability to automatically adjust to any floor and navigate around furniture–that stuff is cool and all, but it’s also what we expect. Why not give people something a bit more unique? It would certainly be great for us. And if it’s great for us, isn’t it great for you too?
Just something to think about.

Twelve-year-olds Arthur and Lisa, having split up to cover more of the town, reconvened at the tree house to compare their trick-or-treat bounties. They’d both dressed as zombies, but even through all the gory face paint, their disappointment was clear.
“Another lame Halloween,” Arthur said. “It’s like, what’s wrong with giving out candy? Everyone around here tries to get too creative. I got the worst stuff.”
“You got the worst? Wait until you see what I’ve got,” Lisa said.
They sat down and began removing items from their respective glowing Pop Lights bags.
“Look at this,” Arthur said. “Someone gave me one Triscuit!”
“If you want something to dip it in, I’ve got a bunch of ketchup packets here from an old lady,” Lisa said. “Hey, what’s that sloshing noise?”
“Loose soup,” Arthur said. “The guy just ladled it into my bag.”
Lisa leaned over and looked. “Are those malt balls floating in it?”
“Nope. Meatballs. It’s Italian wedding.”
“At least you can eat that,” Lisa said. “I don’t know what to do with these ticket stubs from a 1992 Celine Dion concert.”
Arthur put on a pair of eyeglasses. “Let me see them.”
Lisa handed the stubs over. “I didn’t know you wore glasses.”
“I don’t,” Arthur said. “Someone on Fourth was handing these out.”
“New?”
“Gently used,” Arthur said.
“Maybe I could use them to read this.” Lisa pulled out a stack of papers from her glowing Halloween bag. “Guy on twelfth was giving out copies of his unfinished novel. And I need to have critiques back to him in two weeks.”
“How is it?”
“It’s okay. There are some point of telling issues. Like, if you’re going to use a retrospective POV, the narrator can’t be surprised by the events as they unfold. Also, some of the fantastical elements frustrate me. I keep thinking: what are the rules of this world?”
“Huh,” Arthur said. “I wouldn’t be much help. I’m a journalist, not a novelist. Or at least I am now that a woman on Church Street gave me this.” He handed a diploma over to Lisa.
“Wow, a journalism degree! From George Washington University! They could be really useful,” Lisa said, “for mopping up the soup!”
“Hey, good idea,” Arthur said.
“I have no idea what to do with this.” Lisa held a sheet of paper.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“An NDA,” Lisa said.
“For what?”
“I can’t tell you.”
The two of them fell silent for a moment.
“You want one of these I Trick-or-Treated 2018 stickers?” Arthur offered.
Lisa took one. “Thanks. You want any of these Spirit Airline points I got over on Main?”
“Sure. How about some opportunities to build real wealth and passive income through direct marketing? Someone on Grand was handing those out.”
“Couldn’t hurt,” Lisa said.
“That’s it for me,” Arthur said. “And to think: I thought my parents were the lame ones for handing out some fidget spinners they bought online. What a bust!”
“Actually, maybe it wasn’t a total bust. A family on Breezy Lane did give me this.” Lisa took it out and set it down between them.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“I think it’s another, smaller, Halloween.” Lisa pointed at something swirling. “See, look.”

Probably, we should lie. We should say that this is practical. We should say something like: you can garden from inside! We should claim something about how, with the success of HBO’s Sharp Objects, wealthy families have a renewed interest in dollhouses, and some of them are even hiring full construction crews to break ground and build them; get the heavy duty equipment your crew needs to beat out the other bidders!
But we won’t. Instead, we’ll look both ways, we’ll lean forward, we’ll gesture for your to lean forward too, and then we’ll whisper into your ear…
We’re selling this so you can give it as a gift.
We’re cautious to admit this because you know how people get. The holiday season is filled with camaraderie, but few forms are as cathartic as uniting against its annual encroachment. They’ve got the decorations up and it’s not even December, you’ll say to a stranger in the coffee shop. Are they playing “Jingle Bells”? Before Thanksgiving? someone will say in the checkout line at the grocery store. You’ll shake your head when Santa’s village appears in the mall before the first significant snowfall, or when you see a flyer informing you that Black Friday sales somehow start on Tuesday this year.
And here we are, making our first offering of the gift-giving season weeks before Halloween! What gall, you think. What nerve. But friends: hear us out. By offering this R/C Excavator today, we’re not trying to get a jump on anyone… but ourselves.
Though we don’t always act like it, at the end of the day, we’re a store. The holiday season should be our time to shine. And yet, to really “kill it” during the holidays, you need to be sure of yourself. You need to be organized, to know when things will ship and how long they will take to get to where they’re going. You need to build a balanced approached; you can’t just sell a bunch of toys or a bunch of electronics or a bunch of socks. You need to offer all three at different times based on sales trends from previous years.
But let’s be real here, Meh doesn’t exactly stand for “Meticulous, engaged, and hardworking.” It stands for… ummm… we don’t know. It was hard enough to come up with “Meticulous, engaged, and hardworking,” and honestly, now we could use a nap.
In other words, we’re not kicking off the holiday season early. We just want to get out ahead of things and make sure that, come a couple months from now, you’re not cursing our name while trying to explain what “in 3 to 10 business days” means to your construction-minded kid.

Two-for-Tuesday? Where’s the ambition in that? Yes, it sounds nice. But we can’t let alliteration lower our standards. So today, it’s four-for-Tuesday or twenty-four-for-Tuesday (which, I guess is technically alliterative).
That’s right, a choice between four or twenty-four. You know that means, it’s…
ORDER/HOARDER!!!
In these semi-regular sales, we provide two options: one a fair number of things for a good price; the other is an unfair number of things for a GREAT price. So, without further ado, let’s get started.
Today’s product is…
FLEECE BLANKETS!
I don’t know about where you all live, but here, the weather has taken a dark turn. It even snowed yesterday! Which means: it’s time to make a nice cup of tea or cocoa and bundle up under a fleece blanket on the couch with one to twelve dogs and/or cats for the next five months.
THE MATH
The four-pack will run you $14. That’s $3.50 per blanket. Not bad, right? But wait! The twenty-four pack goes for $60. That’s $2.50 per blanket. But wait even more! If the first four cost $14, that means the last twenty cost just $46, which is $2.30 per blanket! Does it make sense to break it down like that? Probably not! But that’s how we do it here on Order/Hoarder days!
WHAT TO DO WITH FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
With four fleece blankets, you can put one on the couch, one on recliner, keep one in the office, and still have a backup to rotate in when one is being washed. Or, store them all in a closet and break them out for a late fall bonfire.
WHAT TO DO WITH TWENTY-FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
So! Much! For example:


You could give them out as gifts to twenty-four of your favorite people!


Or, if you don’t have twenty-four favorite people, give them as gifts to twelve of your favorite people! (You can use the remaining twelve fleece blankets as wrapping paper for the other twelve fleece blankets!)


Send one to each venue on your favorite band’s 24-stop winter tour to show you’re a true fan!


Or, give one to all but four members of the twenty-eight piece Swedish indie pop group, I’m From Barcelona, in case they have to play any cold weather outdoor festivals! If they complain about not everyone getting a blanket, just tell them you’re not the idiot who decided to start a twenty-eight person band!


Use them to build a winter-ready tent in the bank yard! Actually, hell, you’ve got 24 fleece blankets! Build a winter-ready tent mansion!


Interior decorators will tell you that the right lighting can give rooms a soft, warm feeling; we say, why stop at lights? Why not take that “soft, warm feeling” over the top by wallpapering your house with fleece blankets?


See? Maybe twenty-four fleece blankets isn’t so impractical after all.
So, what’s it going to be: are you going to place a boring old order, or are you going to take the exciting first steps to becoming a fleece blanket hoarder?"	0.05			2018-10-16T04:00:03.596Z	0.3410857897640822	0.93	63281

Let’s start off general and work our way into more specifics. Every laptop manufacturer calls their product something different, but a Chromebook isn’t just a cool name. It’s actually a different kind of computer. Laptop Magazine sums it up nicely:

Instead of Windows 10 or macOS, Chromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. These machines are designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with most applications and documents living in the cloud.

In other words, if you live in a cabin somewhere in the mountains, and you have to hike and ski many miles back to civilization to grab a solitary bar of wi-fi, this might not be your best bet. Nor would it be a good option if you’re looking for a machine that can support your career cutting movie trailers and playing the latest computer games. These things are pretty sparse, in terms of power.
But for the rest of us, who pretty much never stray far from the router and who mostly use our computers for checking email, keeping track of things, writing, and organizing: a Chromebook is actually a pretty great, pretty cheap option.
And this one is actually both of those things: we’re selling it for just under $150, and on Amazon it has four stars on over 1,000 reviews.
Yes, if you want to be cynical, you could say: but wait, Meh, this thing came back out who-knows-when, and many of those reviews were written a while ago. And that’s true. BUT 1) there were still five star reviews coming in as recently as August of 2018; and 2) never underestimate the online reviewer. Like, these people self-identify as arbiters of all that is good (and not good) to buy; do you really think they wouldn’t rush to update their review the minute anything goes wrong?
Besides, let’s be totally honest: as much as we like to talk about the forward march of tech, most of us are still using our computers for the exact same things as we did five years ago. New apps come and go, but we’ll always need to make spreadsheets and type up documents and check our email.
Who knows? Maybe it’s a blessing it’s a little older: it might mean it was unaffected by the Gmail redesign. That’d be worth the price alone, if you ask us!"	0.05			2018-10-15T04:00:05.520Z	0.2839675274780344	0.93	64996

Mr. Khool was the coolest teacher at Meh High. He taught an elective called The Mathematics of Skating, a class he only managed to get approved after bringing the principal to a skate park and catching phat air while explaining how each side of a halfpipe was essentially a graph of exponential growth. Now, he was on his way to teach his first session of it when, rounding a corner, he heard stifled sobs.
Narf, hunched next to the water fountain, tried to straighten up when he saw Mr. Khool approaching. “Oh, hey, Mr. Khool. I was just… uh… making sure the fountains weren’t leaking.”
“Sounds like the only thing leaking are your eyes, l’il guy,” said Mr. Khool, crouching next to him. “You want to talk about it?”
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Narf said. “It’s just… well… I feel like when all the other kids ask for stuff, they get it right away. Toothbrushes. Jerky. Fidget spinners. But I’ve been asking for the same thing for years, and nobody takes me seriously.”
“I know what you’re going through,” Mr. Khool said.
“You do?”
“Sure! Being a cool guy is great, but sometimes it’s hard to get people to take me seriously. They think it’s all kick flips and cliff jumps, when really that’s only like 60 to 70 percent of what I do. There’s also a lot of hard work that nobody gives me credit for. But you know what? Whenever I start to feel like maybe it’s time to trade my longboard in for a Prius, I remind myself: there’s a reason progress and persistence both start with p. A friend of mine told me that once. His name was Tony Hawke.”
Narf’s eyes went wide. “Tony Hawk the skateboarder?”
“No,” Mr. Khool said. “This is Hawke with an e. He was Ethan Hawke’s second cousin. We played in a band together in college. And actually he went by Anthony.”
“So do you just call him Tony Hawke so people think you’re talking about Tony Hawk?”
“It doesn’t matter why I do it,” Mr. Khool said. “The point is, it’s a decision I made to call him Tony. And we all have decisions to make in this life. So, are you going to give up, or are you going to decide to keep chasing your dreams?”
Narf stood up. “You’re right! It doesn’t matter that it’s taken this long! I can’t give up now, not for anything!”
“That’s right! So, what is it that you’ve been asking for?”
“A cat shirt,” Narf said.
“Wait, seriously?” Mr. Khool said, getting to his feet. “But you’re Narf. You’re wearing a cat shirt right now. And you wore one yesterday. And the day before that. And actually every other day too. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the same cat shirt twice, now that I think about it.”
Narf slung his backpack over his shoulder. “Sorry, Mr. Khool. I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve gotta get to chem. Thanks again! You really said exactly what I needed to hear!”
“That’s great,” Mr. Khool said. “Although, maybe we need some other designs?”
But Narf was already off and running to his next class.

Douglas, We’re glad you’re here. We can see you’re confused, but don’t worry: all will be explained. You see, when LeAnn said to come home so you two could “take a scenic flight over a pristine lake” together, she was lying. This is an intervention. We, your friends and family–we’re all worried about you, Douglas.
It all began when you bought that Odyssey Stellar NX Drone. You said it was a way to bond with your son. But you didn’t let Trevor use it much, did you, Douglas? Still, it was a fun hobby for you. You liked that it came with a VR headset, so you could see from the drone’s POV. You would fly it, recharge it, fly it, recharge it, all day.
Only after a few months did we start to see the warning signs. You walked into furniture, cursing your legs. You started standing on the dining table to watch television. You called this “a more natural prospective.”
Then there was the mini drone that came with your purchase of the original drone. You started calling it ‘l’il guy,’ then ‘son,’ then finally you named it. It would’ve seemed cute, if you didn’t choose, ‘Trevor,’ the same name as your real son.
Yes, Douglas, that’s right: only one of them is your real son. Because you are not a drone, Douglas! You are a man! You might spend days coming out of drone-prospective for only as long as it takes your Odyssey to charge. You might spend these times with your eyes closed tight, whispering, “it’s a dream, it’s just a dream,” so as not to face the fact that you are a human being, and as such, you are bound by gravity to remain on the ground.
But it’s not healthy, Douglas! You have a family! You have a job! You have obligations! You can’t just ignore them because you have “a new life in the sky” now. It can be a fun hobby, but you’ll never really be a drone, Douglas. You need to start seeing that. And moreover, you need to apologize to all of us for what you’ve put us through.

User @alacrity wants one thing and one thing only: a margarita.
When we sold a Copper Cookware set, they wrote:

well, I guess I could serve margaritas in these…

On a two-pack of posture trainers:

it has to be said: these make really shitty margaritas.

For a 2-pack of cast aluminum skillets:

well, I guess I could drink a margarita out of em… but there’s still the salted rim thing.

A coffee maker:

this will make very hot margaritas.

Earrings:

these are absolutely useless for margaritas.

You might notice that these are not all sales from the last few months. No, @alacrity has lived with desire for years. But that will change today. Because today we are selling a Cuisinart Waring Pro Blade Blender.
And yet the story does not end here. What we want to know is: how does @alacrity feel about this?
Will they arrive at the site today relieved? Will they cry aloud, “For many years I have wished for nothing more than a sweet lime-rich tequila cocktail. And at long last, the great Meh has delivered to me a device that shall itself deliver me to my own personal paradise. Thank you, Meh! Thank you so much!”?
Or will they feel some resentment? Will they realize, all too late, that the real margarita was the friends they made along the way? Or, to put it differently: is there any margarita that’s as sweet on the lips as camaraderie is to the heart?
And yet, there remains a fact we have not reconciled: uhh, like, hello? We’ve sold blenders before!
So perhaps we’re misreading @alacrity. Perhaps, they do not hope for their own margaritas at all. Perhaps they seek only to be a sort of margarita-specific town-crier, to stand in the virtual park at the center of Meh and warn all those around them about the dangers of attempting margaritas in products not optimized for margaritas.
And then of course, there is the final possibility: maybe @alacrity prefers margaritas on the rocks.

Watches? I never wear watches. Why would I wear a watch in the age of cellphones? That’s what I say. Because I believe in efficiency. It guides my every waking move, from the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the time I lay down to sleep at night. (That’s the alarm on my phone, by the way. Why have an alarm clock when you have a cell phone?)
But it’s one thing to say you believe in efficiency, and it’s a whole other thing to live by it. I know because I do. To prove it, I’ll run through my average morning:
First thing’s first, I make breakfast. It’s the same every day: spaghetti and meatballs. I have it for lunch too. And dinner. Food is food, isn’t it? Why should I have different foods for different meals?
When I’m done eating, I floss and brush my teeth, then spit into the drain in my shower. Because why have a sink when you have a shower? Is not a shower a human-height sink? Think about that for a second. Anyway, when I’m done brushing my teeth, I wash my hands with shampoo. Soap-products are soap-products, after all! Then I shave, checking my reflection in the mirror–by which I mean, my phone, on selfie mode.
A little bit of leisure time is part of being efficient too. So, before heading out the door to work, I take twenty minutes to relax. I might watch a show (on my phone) or read a book (on my phone). But soon enough it’s time to check the weather (on my phone). To confirm the app, I look out the window–the single window I have in my whole house. Why do I need to see out my house from so many different sides? Outside is outside, no matter what way you’re looking at it. One window is plenty.
Using this information, I decide what I’m going to wear: pants or shorts. I should elaborate; it’s the one garment, but it’s got a zipper so I can unzip them at the knee when it gets warm. It’s the same pair I wear every day, because again, for me it’s all about efficiency. Not everyone is a fan of this. My sister, for example, once said she actually hated my zip-on pant-shorts. She said I should switch things up by wearing something else sometimes. She said that by wearing them I was ruining her wedding. Can you believe that?
She hasn’t spoken to me since then, but I don’t mind. I still have another sister, and honestly, at the time, I was in the middle of a painful decision of which sister I would keep. Two sisters? Are you crazy? Who needs all that in your life?
Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh, right: these watches. Yep, don’t need them. Although, they would go nicely with the one sweatshirt always I wear, especially on days when it’s hot enough that I have to roll up the sleeves. And if you’re wondering why I don’t just take it off, it’s simple: I’m not wearing anything underneath. Wearing a shirt under what is essentially another shirt? That’s nuts!"	0.06			2018-10-11T04:00:06.347Z	0.3548942995103143	0.93	61867

Imagine for a moment you’re a secret agent. You’ve been called upon to infiltrate a very important party held by a tycoon with designs to take over the world. You need to take a video of the party, so key attendees can be identified, and hopefully sneak into the study where you’re told the plans for the doomsday device are kept. For this mission, you’ll be provided with a PogoCam. It’s smaller than a tube of lip balm, attaches magnetically to your favorite pair of glasses, and shoots 5 megapixel photos and 720p HD videos. You just need to go to Q to collect it.
FYI: in this imagined scenario, Q refers to the dumpster behind the Qwikmart convenience store down the block, not the genius gadgeteer from the movies. Because, boy oh boy, would that guy steer clear of this thing.
In fact, over on Amazon the PogoCam only has 2.5 stars. That’s some real ruh-roh territory, especially given most products fall into a 3 star rating just by being delivered. People who bought it without the Pogotrack sunglasses offered here griped about the safety loop required when using your own pair.  Others complain about the picture quality or that it only takes 30-second video clips.  One user goes even further: “while I have little proof,” LE says, “[I] believe PogoCam has been the cause of much of the world’s turmoil lately.”
Not great!
But here’s the thing: since it’s come out and been revealed to be of less than desirable quality, the PogoCam’s price has tanked. In fact, I’m told that at one point is retailed for as high as $150. That’s nuts. But even with all those price drops, it’s still just shy of 50 on the 'zon.
We’re selling it for $24. For that price, it can just be a fun little gimmicky impulse buy. Wear it once or twice and you’ve pretty much justified the purchase. If you get it to work better than a bunch of Amazon reviewers and find some real use for it, awesome! If not, at least you got some sweet magnetic sunglasses out of the deal.

There were only two of them in the conference room, but when the engineer placed the SmartStand prototype on the table, his hands still shook with anxiety, as if he were making a presentation to the entire company. In a way, he was. Across the table sat the founder and CEO.
“Looks simple.”
“Just as you asked, sir,” the engineer said.
“So let’s talk features,” said the CEO. “It can hold your tablet or phone while you’re cooking, so that the recipe is easy to read?”
“Yes, sir,” said the engineer.
“And it tracks the ingredients used, placing orders based on what’s running low in your cabinet and refrigerator?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it intuit how romantic a given meal seems, and adjust the room’s lighting accordingly?”
“No, sir.”
“Does it feature an olfactory sensor that reads the smell of the meal and gives spicing advice?”
“No, sir.”
“Let’s talk about travel use: on an airplane, it can hold up your phone or tablet making it easier to watch a show or movie?”
“Yes, sir.”
“And it can place drink orders with the flight attendant, based upon the mood of said show or movie?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it message the gate attendants of your connecting flight, informing them when delays get in the way of your lunch or dinner plans, so they know to have a torta from Frontera waiting for you?”
“No, sir.”
“Tell me that it can at least read the forecast for your destination and place orders for weather-appropriate pants.”
“It can’t, sir.”
The CEO stared for a long time at the prototype. “So, it’s not ‘smart’ at all?”
“Well, sir,” the engineer said, “I like to think of it like this: by adding a number of attention-grabbing but ultimately unnecessary and overcomplicated ‘smart’ features, we’d only introduce the possibility for bugs and glitches. Not to mention we would have to put out different models for different phones and tablets. So, despite how it may seem, this is a ‘smart’ product, in that simplicity is smart, because it leads to ease of use and universal compatibility.”
The CEO pounded his fist on the table. “I like that! I like that a lot! Not smart is actually smart! That’s great! That’s gonna help me a lot, not just at work, but also in my personal life!”
“Actually, sir, what I said was simplicity is–”

We’re entering the time of year when everything freezes and dies and allergies are replaced by a sense of tired dryness. For some of you, this might be a relief. And yet, consider these two things: first, said dryness does nothing to dry up non-seasonal allergies, like those related to pets; and second, spring will be back sooner than you think with its pollen-thick air. And just like the smart shopper buys next year’s wrapping paper the day after Christmas when it’s marked down to nothing, so too does he or she purchase an allergen-optimized vacuum just as allergy season winds down.
And boy oh boy, does this thing suck up allergies. In fact, it “captures and traps 99.9% of dust and allergens down to 1 micron.” As a non-allergy-sufferer myself, I don’t know exactly what that means. I can tell you that, given the the word “micron” is pretty much just “micro” with an n, it sounds pretty small.
What I actually CANNOT understand is what the fuck “MultiFLEX Technology” is. I know that it “provides flexible reach for under furniture and freestanding, compact storage.” But what does that mean, exactly? Digging a little deeper, I found that the “MultiFLEX wand bends so you don’t have to, reaching under low lying furniture with ease.” So, apparently, it’s a kind of semi-flexible wand? That’s it? Seriously?
But friends, I’m not mad. No, not at all. In fact, I think it’s smart. Genius even! Every feature of every product, regardless of how mundane, should get the marketing-speak treatment. For example:

Yes, on one level, the design is simple: it’s the Meh face, or should we say, the many (meh-ny) Meh faces you see when you come to our site. It’s a button. You press it. You keep a streak going, if you want. Or else you don’t; you reserve the Meh button only to show your nonplussedness. It’s something that makes our site special, a little inside joke among you, the customer, and us.
But, on another level, the design means so much more. It’s a tribute. To us. And all we’ve done for the world of commerce. Before we came along, all was excitement, and much of it was false. Companies didn’t know that it was fine enough to be, well, fine enough. Everything had to be glorious and exuberant. But then we showed up, and we taught people that it doesn’t always have to be that way. You don’t have to worry about moving the proverbial needle. You don’t need to dial it up to a ten. You can hang out at a five if you want.

It’s pretty simple, except for one wrinkle, which is that you get to choose what capacity power bank you want: 4200, 6000, or 9000 mAh. Now, most modern phones can be fully charged with between 2000 and 3000 mAh, which means even the smallest power bank we’re offering can charge your phone somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times. By that standard, you could get 2.5 to 3 full charges with a 6000 mAh power bank, and 4.5 to 5 with the 9,000.

You’ve got a full day ahead of you, enacting archaic rituals and making shady transactions in a number of parks in and around Cincinnati. And let’s just say the Corrigans didn’t factor in any time for you to stop and juice up your phone. Which is a problem, because you need to be face-timing the entire time so they can be sure you don’t call the cops. In short: you’re gonna need some serious recharge power.

You find that you have an intense desire to work out. You go running and clock 18 miles easily. The next day you go further. And further after that. Soon you’re running up mountains just to get your heart rate going. You’ve made partner at the firm, which is crazy because you don’t remember becoming a lawyer. The paychecks are amazing.

Each year, representatives from all 50 European countries gather for the EuroSock Summit to discuss potential changes to the sock’s age-old design. Here is a summary of year’s Summit, which took place in Luxembourg in a chamber deep inside the Grand Ducal Palace:


The representative from Sweden proposed changing the design, so that the sock appeared strangely both modern yet antiquated, like a torture device, but also attractive and entirely comfortable. Motion failed to pass by a vote of 11 to 39.


The representative from Italy proposed making the next EuroSock as soft as the richest pillowy ball of burrata, as delicate to touch as the most sumptuous pluck-able leaves of basil, and yet as firm as tagliatelle cooked to a perfect al dente. Also: more garlic. Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 19 to 31.


The representative from France proposed making the sock from a distinct material that would grow delightfully crusty over night, so to it could be enjoyed the next day. There was some confusion over this, but eventually the representative from France admitted she was simply hungry, having been disappointed in her hotel’s bread options that morning at breakfast. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Norway proposed making the sock seven times thicker. When someone suggested he have multiple pairs of socks–some for summer, others for winter–he smiled and nodded, saying, “Yes, exactly! These would be for summer!” Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 3 to 47.


The representative from Ireland proposed making the socks out of a darker fabric, one “as pitch black as a Guinness.” The representative from Belgium chimed in to add that the fabric should be strong, “not unlike a delicious quadrupel.” The German representative also leaned forward to propose adding a pinch of sea salt, “one of the key ingredients in a traditional gose.” When they all three broke down laughing it became clear that they’d partaken in a few of the aforementioned beverages during the break for lunch.

When I first saw that we were selling an air fryer, I was torn.
On the one hand, Wirecutter pretty emphatically stated that they don’t recommend these things for how expensive they are. If you’re not familiar with Wirecutter, they’re basically one of the best and most straightforward resources for when you’re buying kitchen appliances, electronics, and just about everything in between. They do a lot of research and provide simple, easy-to-understand articles replete with concrete purchasing recommendations. So, their opinion carries a lot of weight.
On the other hand, my dad has an air fryer and he likes it.
Two venerable sources. Two contradictory opinions. I didn’t know who to trust. So I began to dig deeper. Here’s what I found:


While working on his Wirecutter article, Michael Sullivan conducted more than 35 hours worth of air fryer tests. In the end, he was so unimpressed with them that he recommended buying a simple convection toaster oven to get a better bang for your buck.


Back when I was in high school, my dad used to change my car’s oil. Not just check it, mind you, but perform a full-blown change. He had a little pit in the garage, so you could pull your car right in and he’d take care of it every 3000 miles.


Given those two facts, I came to the following conclusion: it was possible that my dad had also used his air fryer for 35 total hours, yet it was very unlikely that Michael Sullivan had ever changed the oil in my car when I was in high school. This seemed like a pretty clear “checkmate” situation. But then I remembered that an air fryer’s greatest selling point is its oil-free frying. Thus, it only seemed fair that all oil-based arguments need be discarded. I found myself right back at square one.
Then it hit me: my dad is a Meh customer. He likely bought his air fryer right here on this very site. Meanwhile, Wirecutter suggests a model that retails at about $250, which is FIVE TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS ONE. Furthermore, they never say they’re outright bad; they just say they aren’t worth the money. Which makes sense: my dad would likely not be the satisfied air-frying customer he is today had he been required to fork over more than 200 bucks.
Therefore, Wirecutter, I know we’ve suggested this before, but if you’re reading this, consider an addendum to your initial verdict of “Not recommended”: something like, “unless it’s selling on Meh for almost a fifth of the cost, in which case, go to town.” I’d be happy to put you in touch with my dad if you need any more information."	0.05			2018-10-03T04:00:13.622Z	0.4058992852291472	0.92	65054		0.15524434813545068

In the grand scheme of things, I’m pretty smart about health stuff. No, not necessarily among other humans. I mean in the REAL grand scheme, as in: among all living creatures in the world. I sometimes eat too many donuts, or drink so much coffee that I give myself a headache. But I at least KNOW what I’ve done immediately after I’ve done it. And compared to my cats or my dog, I come out looking like a friggin’ genius!
For example, I won’t find my way into the trash and attempt to consume a giant wad of paper towels that were used to soak up frying oil, only to slink behind the couch and embarrassedly vomit it up. And if I found myself stuck in a bathroom, I would wait patiently until someone got home and ask them for some help. I would not, under any circumstances, try to EAT MY WAY OUT, causing enough damage so that both the door and the trim need to be replaced, and giving myself a pretty rough tummy ache along the way. Another point in my favor: I understand the utility of pills as well as the ease with which they can be taken. They don’t need to be hidden in cheese or loaded into a little plastic contraption to be shot deep into my throat in order to induce swallowing. I just take them!
And yet, even as I type these gloating words, I’m sitting in a rickety wooden chair, leaning awkwardly over my laptop. Unlike the damage of a few too many donuts or a bit too much coffee, I won’t feel the effects of my bad poor posture for many years. And yet, I know this, but I do nothing to correct it.
In a way, poor posture is like the human version of eating out of the garbage. We just can’t help it. Instead of taste-testing rotten meat or chewing on plastic bags, we hunch. And just as pets need help learning what they should and should not do, often for their own good, so do we.
That’s where this this Posture PT Confidence Corrector comes in. It can fit onto just about any chair–from office chairs to the driver’s seat of your car–and it improves posture, which in turn strengthens your core and reduces lower back and shoulder pain. Or, to put it differently, it’s not unlike a spray that makes bad posture smell like sour apples!
Okay, that’s going a little overboard with the pet metaphor thing. It’s not a spray. It’s a posture corrector. Sorry for the confusion. Now buy one, and straighten out your life. Got it?"	0.05			2018-10-02T04:00:03.835Z	0.31486252125742953	0.93	62431

Today’s sale leaves us conflicted. On the one hand, this would seem like an Order/Hoarder sale: you’re given options, some more reasonable than others. On the other, it’s not exactly the same as past Order/Hoarder sales we’ve offered. For example, there are more than two options. So, if you don’t mind, we thought we could work through this together, with a little Q&A:
How does the math break down?
This is a little more complicated than usual. You can get a 40 pack of basic fidget spinners for $14 ($0.35/spinner) or a 40 pack of LED fidget spinners for $16 ($0.40/spinner). But you could also get a 160 pack of both LED and basic fidget spinners (an 80 and 80 split) for $34. Which is about $0.21 per spinner… except, if you think about it: the first 40 basic spinners cost $14 and the first 40 LED spinners cost $16, which adds up to $30. So that’s a mere $4 for the last 80 fidget spinners, or a nickel per! CRAZY!
So then why wouldn’t this be an Order/Hoarder sale?
For three reasons:


As mentioned above, it’s not an either/or. There are three options.


40 fidget spinners will already have you well on your way to hoarding fidget spinners; but, more importantly…


These aren’t really for hoarding! We’re offering them now, because we want  to get them to you with plenty of time to spare before the end of the month. That way, you can offer them out to Trick Or Treaters on Halloween. That doesn’t sound very hoarderly at all, does it?


Why wouldn’t you just give candy away on Halloween like everyone else?
Because fidget spinners are fun and will last longer. Also, this site is run by someone from Saint Louis where some people give out jokes instead of chocolate, so it’s kind of on brand for us to eschew the national standard for Halloween practices.
Wait, back up: what even ARE fidget spinners?
They’re goofy little spinny toys with no real purpose other then to be fidgeted with.
That’s sorta dumb, isn’t it?
You might think so, but in a world where people try to sell peppermint-scented oil as an alternative to physical therapy, I find it refreshing that there’s a product out there that’s explicitly for useless goofings-off.

You might wear the shirt proudly at first: to work, or out to grab drinks with friends, or when you’re on vacation, or when you’re visiting family. The people around you might ask, “Who made that shirt?” And you might respond: “Meh.” But really, you’ll want to say: “Me. I made it. Or I made it possible. Because had I not badgered them, had I not joined forces with @reclaimercube, the great bringer of the brush, there is a chance–nay, there is a certainty–that they never would have sold this or any shirt ever again.” And you might beam inwardly to yourself.
But many years from now–long after the shirt has got through the cycle: from wear-it-whenever-you-can, to wear-it-sometimes, to laundry-day-only, to pajama-top, to lawn-mowing-shirt, to rag, and finally to trash–you might be driving down a desolate midwestern highway, listening to a true-crime podcast, and you might suddenly remember: all the time you spent on a deal-a-day site’s forum rallying to spend ten dollars on some silly shirt.

On September 13th, user @djslack offered up a list of potential things we could sell, including “some kind of interesting jerky type product.” And so here we are selling delicious Wicked Cutz jerky!
Now, we need to make two things clear:
First, this is some pretty classy jerky. Therefore, the price tag isn’t going to be exactly in line with the Slim Jim that you buy on a whim as you check out at the grocery store, only to open it in your car and for the noxious smell to make you regret your decision, although not enough to stop you from eating it. Hypothetically speaking. Point is: this is good jerky and good jerky costs money.
Second, and more importantly: we need to make something EXCEEDINGLY clear. We saw @djslack’s suggestion and considered it, but the decision to sell the jerky ultimately came down to us and us alone. In fact, there’s a chance that we subconsciously were thinking about selling jerky and so @djslack didn’t exactly give us the idea as much as surface it.
What we’re saying is: we’re not necessarily in the business of outsourcing our product selection. As in, we don’t do requests. As in, don’t get used to this, okay? Because this is it. The party ends here.
We say this because ever since we sold some toothbrushes as a joke–that’s right, it was a joke! A joke ON YOU!–we know there have been rumblings on the forums about something you’d like us to sell. That’s how obstinate we are, people: we won’t even name the item. We won’t even write the word. Because we are unmovable.
We’re like a brick wall. People always tell us that. They say, “Talking to you all is like talking to a brick wall.” Which we take as a compliment concerning our strength. And also our attractiveness, given that brick is a very beautiful building material. In certain cases, at least. Maybe not in some of the suburban architecture of the mid-fifties. But then again, those homes have a certain nostalgic beauty in a way. There’s a pure American warmth to them, isn’t there?
What were we talking about? Right: how we’re not a bunch of pushovers, and you can’t boss us around and tell us what to sell!

Dearest Professor Alba,
First off, a hearty congratulations on winning the Henning Prize. Your self-adhering bow-tie is certainly a masterwork, and the award is absolutely deserved. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the ceremony. As I am sure you are aware, since my expulsion, you are my sole correspondent from the Meyer Institute of Alchemic Fashion. But my choice not to attend is not due to some fear of seeing my former classmates and teachers again–or, more accurately, of experiencing their fear as they witness me. No, I cannot attend because I have fallen ill, and I fear this may be the last letter I ever write.
Although, perhaps ‘fallen ill’ is a simplification, as the illness under which I suffer has no name.
The trouble began in my makeshift lab late one night. I was working on a new stitch technique, making minor tweaks to it here and there over the course of several weeks. It was going nowhere, and after one particularly long day toiling in the haberdashery (with no Meyer Certification, I am forced to do such menial labor), I came home so exhausted and angry that I decided to throw it all away in favor of something entirely new.
I am sure you will be disappointed to hear this. During my expulsion hearings, you were the strongest voice in my favor. When the administration said that I “endangered” all those around me with the “diabolical recklessness” of my work, you told them it was just a phase. But Professor Alba, it was not. And while I am not proud to admit that, I am also not exactly not proud either.
For that evening, in my lab, I created something amazing: a stitch unlike any other stitch; a stitch that seemed to take time into it, that seemed to steal tiny slivers of the universe’s fabric and convert them into pure style. It was a stitch that resembled a stitch in only an ethereal way, like a word in another language whose definition we can on some level understand but for which there is no direct translation. I sewed up some pairs of socks with the stitch; despite using bland monochrome fabrics, each pair came out patterned with a bold unpredictable design.
I learned all too late that it was taking something from me as well, that it was essentially draining my life energy, weaving it among each sock’s seams. I fashioned a lead coat to wear while working, but it was too late. The damage has been done. I write this letter to you from bed, Professor Alba, a bed from which I fear I may never again rise. Indeed, just the act of writing has left me pale and exhausted.
But this is not a letter merely bidding farewell to you and this world. You will find, in the envelope, the detailed plans for the aforementioned stitch (as well as for the protective coat). I cannot say what I want for you to do with them. Some days I hope you will set them aflame and think of them no more; other days I hope you will use them to start a line of vibrant and delightful socks to sell around the world.
But, Professor Alba, promise me this: if you choose the latter, make sure to warn the people, to let them know the truth, that these are not simply stitched socks.

This compact first aid kit is exactly what it says it is: a small kit for administering first aid. It has tweezers. It has scissors. And it has one bazillion (read: 121) pieces, including all the gauze, pads, bandages, and alcohol prep packs that you’d need to treat any (read: any NOT super major) wound you sustain while camping, or picnicking, or what have you. Its size makes it the ideal first aid kit to buy, leave in your car, and just forget about until you need it.
That’s all pretty simple.
But what comes next? This is what no one ever talks about: how to build and successfully administer a second aid kit. Luckily, we can help.
Step 1: Gather your supplies. You will need a chair (worn, in an endearing, well-loved way); a blanket (soft, warm, but not too warm); a cat (purring); and a remote control (to a Roku, Apple TV, or comparable).
Step 2: Apply ass to chair. (Optional, recline chair or use ottoman to extend legs).
Step 3: Apply blanket to lap and/or legs.
Step 4: Apply purring cat to blanket at lap area. Pet cat occasionally.
Step 5: Apply hand to remote; locate a binge-worthy show on your television; press play.
Step 6: When your significant other or roommate enters the room and asks if you’re really going to spend all day just sitting there watching television, sigh and say, “You’re right,” then move (very slightly) to get up, stopping only to hiss with pain and grasp at the injury area where the first aid was administered. (Optional: parlay sympathy, if shown, into your significant other or roommate bringing you a hot beverage of your choice: coffee, tea, cocoa, or apple cider.)
Step 7: When your significant other or roommate leaves the room, replace purring cat (if riled by your attempt to get up), rewind show as needed, and resume viewing.
There: you’ve successfully built and administered a second aid kit. Now, just buy this compact first aid kit, and you’ll be all set!"	0.04			2018-09-25T04:00:05.576Z	0.2809856978279806	0.95	74445

Overview: Very good, but not as good as Michael Keaton!!!
Before I get into my review, I want to give you a little bit of background: I’m a huge Michael Keaton fan and a software developer. Recently, I sold my start-up to a large tech conglomerate for several million dollars. I used that money to build a bunker inside an abandoned warehouse where I would live and wait for Michael Keaton to arrive so I can ask him a few continuity-related questions about his seminal 1996 comedy, Multiplicity, for my podcast: The Podkeast. I won’t list the questions here because I am certain they’ve never been asked and I want to be sure I’m the ones who asks them (more on this below, when I get into the complaints).
I need peace in my bunker to record episodes of The Podkeast and also to meditate and prepare myself for the eventual interview. Luckily, it’s soundproof. That brought up another issue, though: if I can’t hear anything, how will I know when Mike (that’s what I call him in my head sometimes) has arrived?
That’s where The Lynx 1080P Camera comes in! The quality’s great, they’re easy to set up, there’s free cloud storage, and most importantly, it has facial recognition. Using photos, I trained mine to only recognize one face: Michael Keaton’s. Thus, I’ll get a check-in notification whenever he arrives (fingers crossed, any day now!). Any other unfamiliar face alerts that come through I just ignore, because like I said, I don’t need the distractions.
I should say: I do have two complaints. One is that the Lynx recognizes faces really well, but not always the material said faces are made of. What I’m getting at is that my mom keeps showing up in a really realistic Michael Keaton mask (she probably bought it with the start-up money I gave her, ugh!). She always says the same thing: that she’s worried I might be losing my mind. It makes me want to scream. Like, of course I’m losing my mind! I got a check-in notification and thought Michael Friggin’ Keaton was here! And sometimes I do scream. Hey, it’s a sound-proof bunker, gotta get your money’s worth, right?
The other complaint I have is that Michael Keaton has not shown up to do the interview with me. This is probably more a don’t-have-Michael-Keaton’s-contact-info problem than a Lynx problem, but still: with that AND the mask issue, I didn’t feel right giving it five stars.
Overall, though, a very good camera!"	0.05			2018-09-24T04:00:11.601Z	0.2044531578210335	0.94	74861

When it comes to celebrating milestones, different people demand different amounts of ceremony. Some will require you to wear tuxedos and dinner gowns to the their wedding in a restored factory-turned-theater-space, wherein they will prepare a choreographed song and dance commemorating the various defining moments of their relationship. Others will go to the courthouse, sign a few documents, and send a text imploring you to meet them for beers later.
Whether it be a birthday, a successful defense of a PhD dissertation, or a housewarming party–everyone’s a little different. Not everyone wants gifts. But herein lies the one consistent rule, regardless of an event’s formality: if you’re bringing a gift, you have to put it in something festive. Because even the most casual soon-to-be mom isn’t going to stoked when you show up with a onesie still in the shipping box from VintageOnsiesRUs․com.
The problem? Wrapping is stressful. Wrap a gift poorly and you look like a degenerate. Wrap a gift too ornately and you seem like a bit of an over-achiever. Besides, not everything is easy to wrap. If you want to wrap an overstuffed plush starfish, you can either a) put it in a box and wrap that, or b) get your friend who’s an aerospace engineer to help you get the measurements and scissor placement just right so that it doesn’t come out looking like garbage.
Really, your best bet is to put that overstuffed plush starfish into a gift bag. Because the gift bag always looks good. It’s as fun-looking as wrapping paper and as easy as a shipping box. Plus, getting a gift in a gift bag rules. You’re basically getting two gifts, one of which you’re more than encouraged to regift later when you need to give someone else a gift.

You’ll notice that you have two choices on today’s sale. One is reasonable. The other is unreasonable. Or should we say: the other is an UNREASONABLY GOOD DEAL! You know what that means. It’s the return of:
ORDER/HOARDER
For those are unfamiliar, Order/Hoarder is when we offer you two options: a normal number of things for a good price, or an abnormally large number of things for a GREAT price. Today’s product:
Cooling towels!!!
So, let’s break it down:
The Math
“You can’t put a price on cool.” That’s something someone said in a movie once. It doesn’t matter who or what movie or if I just made it up, because it’s not true. You can put a price on being cool.
For example, if you just want to be double-cool (as in, get two cooling towels) you have to pay $12. That comes down to the totally reasonable per towel price of $6 (especially considering they’re $10 over on Amazon).
Now, here’s where it gets a bit more complicated. As we like to point out on these sales, when figuring out the price per unit of the Hoarder order, it’s not as simple as dividing the overall price ($36) by the number of units (12). BECAUSE, your can choose either 2 or 12, no in-betweens. Therefore, if you think about it, you’re already paying $6 for each of the first 2 towels, which means the last 10 towels are only costing you $24, or a mere $2.40 per towel! How about that deal, huh?!
What you can do with a normal order
It’s pretty simple. Cooling towels are not exactly all that, well, cool, but they are functional. With just two of them, you can use one as your main post-workout cool-down towel, and give the other to your spouse or partner. Or you can cycle through both yourself so you don’t have to do laundry as often.
What can you do with a Hoarder order
So much more! Here are just a few suggestions:


Go a day early and leave a cooling towel at each mile marker of your upcoming 20K race, so you never have to worry about getting too hot.


Take all of them and fashion them into a suit or cocktail dress to wear to outdoor weddings. But would a suit or dress made out of cooling towels really be classy enough for something like that? you might ask. To which we would respond: Could it be any less classy than a suit or dress soaked with sweat?


Sure, you could spend a bunch of money on an air conditioner and then a bunch of more money each month to run it. Or, you could save some cash by sewing yourself a delightful cooling towel quilt!


They’d make a great napkin alternative at your 12-guest “super spicy food banquet”.


Are you a do-gooder teen? Do you often dream of fashioning rope ladders out of clothes and blankets to lower yourself out your 2nd story bedroom window so you can run around after bedtime with your new rebellious friends? Only, your palms get so sweaty that you can’t get a good grip? Gosh, if only you could make a rope ladder out of something cool and soothing to the touch!


See? Maybe we were wrong. Maybe 12 cooling towels isn’t an unreasonable amount of cooling towels at all. On the other hand, you still have the option of buying the (completely boring) 2-pack. The decision is yours!

So again, we have no complaints about this particular karaoke system. Our complaint is about karaoke in general, or, to be more specific, about the musical artists we so often choose NOT to sing. That’s right: I’m talking about birds. Despite being nature’s original songwriters, you rarely hear anyone at a karaoke night sing a song by the many great bird-fronted musical groups out there, such as:

Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a child. Let’s call him @Dave. Dave wore Sears-brand Toughskin jeans. They were, as their name implied, durable and long-lasting. But, like most economically practical things, corners needed to be cut to keep them affordable, and, unfortunately for Dave, the corner Toughskin jeans cut was the let’s-make-these-things-look-cool corner.
Or maybe not unfortunately. Because Dave rarely felt self-conscious in his Toughskin jeans. What did make him feel self-conscious was when, in the mid-80s, his grandparents splurged and got him a Generra sweatshirt. It was “in.” Very “in.” In fact, you could say that it was so deeply “in” that the brand couldn’t find its way out of the decade.
Suddenly, all the other kids at school were stopping Dave in the hallway to say, “Cool sweatshirt,” and, after years of remaining invisible behind the Toughskin curtain, he didn’t know how to react to such a compliment. It was uncomfortable.
Dave has come a long way since then… or has he? No, he doesn’t wear Toughskin jeans anymore, but he still has a Toughskin mindset. He’s not afraid of bright purple laptops or speakers that are loud in both function and design. This, in some ways, is his calling: espousing the virtues of things that don’t look exactly like you’d hope but work just fine.
But he doesn’t exactly know what to do with these slick-looking Rowkin Bluetooth Ear Buds.
Does he say: just because Meh sells some stuff that has substance but lacks style does NOT mean the stylish stuff we sell lacks substance in equal measure? Does he point out that many of the negative reviews on Amazon that have driven the average rating down to an unimpressive 3 stars can be put into 3 categories:

people complaining about the hefty (non-Meh) price tag;
people who struggled with a weird issue that was corrected easily by a factory reset; and
people hating on Bluetooth technology as a whole?

Does he mention that many reviews were impressed with both their size and sound quality (and again, that those people were reviewing after, presumably, paying some 50 bucks more the price they are offered at here)?
No. @Dave does none of these things. He has a copywriter do it, duh."	0.05			2018-09-20T04:00:02.850Z	0.2538143856831479	0.92	72743

As we’ve mentioned before, we recently won an auction for a storage locker that was filled entirely with branded content romance novels. Or so we thought. But, picking through the titles, we actually found many belonged to a branded content epic fantasy series by the author L.L.R. Holdien about a warrior named Tarklaw The Powerful. Luckily for us, there’s a chapter in book 19 about today’s product, the Keysmart (and Keysmart Pro).

Having successfully freed the shape-shifting wizard Vintel, son of Filor The Great, from the floating prison of Delkabana, narrowly escaping the light-spears of the Meschlen Guards by leaping through a portal leading somewhere that only a seer like Wise Crin might intuit–Tarklaw found himself deposited into murky waist-high water.
“Vintel?” Tarklaw called out, trying to locate the wizard whom he had just a moment ago saved, despite their families’ centuries-long acrimonious relations.
“I’m right here, Tarklaw,” Vintel seemed to whisper into his ear, buzzingly. “As a shape-shifting wizard, it is my custom to acclimate my shape to the environs, and so I have taken the form a mosquito because we, bitter-family-enemy-turned-savior, appear to be in a swamp.”
“Not just any swamp! The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors!” came a voice that belonged neither to Tarklaw or Vintel, but another in their vicinity. Tarklaw turned quickly, drawing his great sword with a shing sound common of sword-drawing. But he found only a small creature not unlike an unshelled tortoise, swimming towards them. “Forgive me for startling you! I am Rewn, peaceful leader of the Melorians, the primary inhabitants of this swamp at the edge of the Planet Glor at the far reaches of the Heplan Galaxy. Now, I imagine you’ve come here through some pesky portal or other, but fear not: your exit is easily made through one of the Eight Astounding Doors.”
“Doors?” Said Tarklaw. “I am from the planet Phentalon, a place without doors, due to our peoples’ openness with each other.”
“Very noble,” Rewn said. “Perhaps one day, The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors shall be like that. For now, you must choose one. They go to any number of worlds, from the euphorically beautiful mountain-scape of Relan to the hellish fire-deserts of Dumask. And we have all the keys right here…” Rewn dipped under the water for a moment, but re-emerged with a perplexed look upon his creaturely face. “Oh, dear! They were right there a moment ago.”
“You simply allow all keys to be strewn throughout a swamp?” buzzed Vintel.
“Not exactly,” Rewn said, explanatorily. “We keep them all together using an ingenious contraption known as a KeySmart. Made of aircraft aluminum, it can hold eight keys–or as many as fourteen, with an expansion pack! Additionally, it includes a loop for keys belonging to vehicles propelled by motors. Not to mention, its extended frame can hold long or foreign keys, which is especially important to us, as one of our oldest and most prized keys is made from the hollow bird-like finger bone of the fallen Hilderan Mage Lazlorn.”
“But,” Vintel buzzed, contrarily, “as ingenious and organizationally optimized as that all sounds, it seems at present not to be helping in your ability to locate them.”
“Ah, yes, that would be true if it were the base model, which is still good,” Rewn said. “Luckily for us, we opted for the Pro. Not only does it have a built-in LED flashlight and bottle opener; it can also show a map of your missing keys, and by way of the Tile app–which can be accessed via your smartphone or tablet–you can make your keys ring out loud! Of course, I should add at this juncture that the ‘water’ here in the The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors is different in elemental makeup to that of the water on other planets, such as Earth.”
“Are you saying,” Vintel buzzed, clarifyingly, “that just because we are discussing the KeySmart Pro being used in a water-based situation, it should not be taken as an endorsement of it being waterproof?”
“Exactly,” cried Rewn, disclaimingly.
“Much like doors, smartphones and tablets are concepts foreign to my home world,” Tarklaw said. “But that sounds like a great functional product nonetheless.”
“And I will show you just how functional it is!” Rewn cried with excitement. He brought forward a device and opened the Tile app. A moment later, a ding rang out, though it sounded muffled. The three of them turned… and stood facing a giant glowing snake-like beast. It emerged from the water, standing nearly forty Glorian theltans tall, or forty feet tall in Earth measurements, Glorian theltans being exactly equal to terrestrial feet. The ding sounded again, from somewhere deep inside of the monster’s abdomen.
“Oh no! A Mirelord! Run!” Rewn cried with fear. “Or, better yet, swim.” And with that, he disappeared under the water.
But Tarklaw did not swim away. He crouched into a combat ready position as best he could in the deep murky water. The Mirelord leaned closer to him, its eyes alight with evil.
“What are you doing?” buzzed Vintel into his ear, questioningly.
“We must get out of this swamp,” Tarklaw cried. “This is the only way. Though, it will be hard for just the two of us to defeat it…”
“Perhaps, I can help?” came a distinguished voice from Tarklaw’s side.
Tarklaw turned, and saw… no! He couldn’t believe it! “Hinton, son of Raquille, wielder of The Great Axe Of Orlagos, and best friend since birth of Tarklaw The Powerful? But I thought you were–”
“The immortal prisoner of the Inter-dimensional Pirate Lop, locked away in the his ship, The Pummeling Ewlok, for all of eternity?” Hinton laughed. “Not a chance in Dumask, my friend! Now, what do you say we free the aforementioned product from the belly of the beast? Just like old times?”
Tarklaw couldn’t help but smile. “Just like old times, indeed,” he said, and they raised their weapons to the approaching Mirelord."	0.05			2018-09-19T04:00:10.856Z	0.34612555704581827	0.93	72268

One time, I left without remembering to close the door.
I was living in a house somewhere so rural we didn’t need to lock up, and, in a rush to leave (I was going on a trip), I forgot to swing the door all the way closed, leaving only the screen door between my cat and freedom. He was fine. My mom checked on him the next day and, much to her surprise, he emerged from under the deck after spending what must’ve been, for an indoor cat, a terrifying night outside.
Just about every time I have left the house since then, even if just for an hour, I have wondered: “did I close the door? Did I lock the door? Do the pets have food? Do they have water? Did I leave the oven on? Did I unconsciously light seven candles and place them precariously close to window curtains that are, unbeknownst to me, highly flammable?” Many times, I have gone back to check. Never have I left the stove on. Never have I found candles flickering. The pets have always been fine. Only once or twice have I found the door unlocked.
Still, I never regret it, because it’s nicer to know everything’s fine than it is to hope everything’s fine.
And that’s really what these Zmodo MeShare cameras are for: making sure. You can call them “security cameras,” but that feels a little overstated. Maybe it would be better to rebrand them as “check-in cameras.” After all, the chances that you’re going to tune in as your home is being burglarized–thus allowing you to call the authorities while the burglary is in progress–is very low. I mean, hell, the actual likeliness of your home being burglarized at all is very low. And if your first thought upon reading that is, Nuh-uh, my home gets broken into all the time, we won’t argue with you. But we will say: you probably need more than a couple Zmodos.
Otherwise, these are a good option for the second-guessers out there to quell all the concerns that might flare up during your day at work: whether you just want to make sure everything’s fine, or to check that you didn’t forget to close the windows, or to monitor whether your dog is feeling okay after eating something stupid that he wasn’t supposed to…

So, the first thing you need to know is that these are little. They’re for kids or pets, not full-sized adults. So if you’re looking for sectional solution for game day with your buddies: this is no good… unless you’re, like, 10 and so are all your buddies (in which case, make sure you ask your parents before you buy this thing, okay? See! We’re responsible!)
The second thing you need to know is that the backs velcro on, and the seats have magnets in them, which makes them “infinitely configurable.” And yet, if that’s the case, then why is are these proposed layouts so BORING?! They’re mostly just couches. Where’s the fun in that? Why not try something more exciting, like these three designs:
You’re Number One

Will anyone even see that it’s a #1? Probably not. Is it really a practical way to lay out a room? No. But the subliminal reassurance that the design will provide for your child is massive. Every time they sit down they’ll think, “Hey, you know what: I’m special!” And this confidence will push them to do great things.
Game Room

Checkers is simple and boring on a board… but what about in a room, with you and all of your friends as the pieces? To make it more exciting: institute a rule where it’s not as easy as just “jumping” another piece; instead, you have to battle for it. Whoever doesn’t get cast into one of the empty spaces (i.e. onto the floor) wins!
Soft Kitchen

Okay, this isn’t exactly innovative, design-wise. But in terms of utility? Think about it: you cover the floor of your kitchen, wall-to-wall, with Sactionals, and now, suddenly, you can drop a glass or a ceramic mug and it won’t shatter! Plus, they’re machine washable, in case there’s a spill. Best of all, if you need to keep an eye on something you’ve got baking, you can just lay down next to the oven and watch it! What could go wrong?!

A cheers to vacation (which is defined as a trip that occurs when someone, delirious from the heat, begins to think, you know what I bet would be great?

Dear @reclaimercube,
On September 2nd, you posted the following comment on a knife sale:

Meh I have anxiously been awaiting for you to post a toothbrush for sale again. I will post this everyday until you finally sell another one again.

And, @reclaimercube, can we tell you something? We’re very proud of you. Because you kept your word. Since then, each day, you’ve put forward this same request.
Your fellow Meh customers began to notice. One post from Friday, September 7th sparked a discussion that involved more than 20 comments. In that conversation, someone pointed out a toothbrush for sale on a competitor’s site. You, ever strong, refused to take the bait:

not a bad deal… But not on meh so it doesn’t matter. You could link me to colgate’s website or crest’s website for a free toothbrush and I still wouldn’t want it unless it was on meh. I’m chaining myself to this statue. Ride or die mehbrother.

Your repeated request did not specify why you wanted a toothbrush, or what kind of toothbrush you wanted. Really, you haven’t even promised that you’d buy the toothbrush. You’ve only asked, repeatedly, for us to “post a toothbrush.”
Well, good news, @reclaimercube: when we launched Meh, we made a decision. Once, and only once, we would allow a Meh customer to dictate exactly what we’d sell. The only rule was they had to make the request for 13 consecutive days. They could ask for $1 MacBooks, or free puppies, or Cadillac Escalades filled with cash. It didn’t matter. There were no restrictions, aside from the 13 days. Some of us worried the financial hit would be too much, but others felt assured: we could trust our customers! They wouldn’t make unreasonable demands!
So thank you, @reclaimercube; you’ve shown us that our faith was not misplaced. Now, Meh community, let’s all come together and celebrate with this build-your-own-bundle of toothbrushes.
Sincerely,
Meh

Hair: it is the ultimate example of disobedience.
You can train puppies to pee outside, to walk next to you, to sit, to shake, to do any number of fun and/or useful things. With cats, the job is much harder, but with some persistence (and a spray bottle) it is possible to enforce a few rules: you do not yowl in the middle of the night, you do not walk on the kitchen counter, you do not knock our decorative trinkets off the mantle as a game. Even a bonsai can be coaxed, over time, to grow a certain way.
But not hair. Nope, no matter how many times you comb, shave, style, epilate, and wax: it can just never take the fucking hint!
You know that person in your  your life who’s like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “hmm, maybe?” And you hope they’ll just drop it, but then a day later, they’re like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “I don’t know if that dumb thing is really a good idea.” Which should be clear as hell, but they don’t want to listen, so they keep prodding and prodding until you’re like, “Look,  I don’t want to do the dumb thing because it is dumb, and honestly, I’m worried you might be dumb for suggesting it, and I might be dumb for being the friend of such a dumb person.” And you feel terrible but they just smile and say, “C’mon! It’ll be great!”
That’s hair. No matter how many times you try to send the message that you don’t want it to come back there, it keeps coming back there. It is untrainable!
Or is that the wrong way to look at it? Could it be that we are the untrainable ones? That our hair is not being a stubborn learner but a tenacious teacher? That it wants to lead us to a better place? A place where we eschew the standards of beauty thrust upon us? Because isn’t it pretty arbitrary where we say there should be hair and where we say there should not? On the head is good, but not on the face? Except some faces capable of growing thick enough hair? On the chest is okay, but no, never on the back? Not on the legs, but okay on the arms, except in the armpits? Could it be that our hair’s persistence is its way of saying: you need to get the hell over it and just be who you are?

The three brothers had been cleaning out their grandfather’s basement for nearly two hours before they found the FoodSaver.
“What’s this?” said Kyle, holding it up.
“Looks old,” said Jake. “I’d guess circa second half of the 2010’s.”
Terry took it from Kyle and inspected it. “Wait, I know these things. It’s an early model weed-sealer. You know? The devices for vacuum-packing weed so it wouldn’t go bad.”
“All this talk of weed remind me, have you guys taken your three o’clock edibles yet?” Jake asked.
Kyle and Terry nodded.
“But wait,” Kyle said, “why does it say FoodSaver on it, if it’s for weed?”
“You have to understand, Kyle, this was before weed was legal everywhere,” Terry explained. “They didn’t even put it in the water back then!”
Kyle looked at the FoodSaver perplexed. “Really?”
“I’m serious,” Terry said. “So people weren’t as acclimated to it as we are now. They considered it a drug. Thus, when people took some, they got ‘high,’ which basically meant they thought without logic. So it’s likely that the inventor of the ‘FoodSaver’ only named it such because he was super high, and probably pretty hungry.”
“So strange to think that the same substance that keeps us calm and measured, used to have almost the opposite effect!” Kyle said.
Now Jake had the FoodSaver. “Are you sure this is a weed-sealer? To me, it looks like an early sous-vide-assistant. That would make more sense with the FoodSaver name.”
“Did they even sous vide back then?” Terry asked.
“Sure,” Jake said. “It was more of a luxury, though, given that it was before the Microwave And Oven Act of 2035.”
“When I read about those times, and all the negative-energy-pollution caused by those now illegal kitchen appliances, it just makes me sick,” Terry said.
“Guys, you’ve got me thinking…” Kyle paused to gather his thoughts. “Well, you know how when we put stuff in the freezer, it just freezes together and gets covered in weird ice?”
“They’re called water diamonds, Kyle,” Terry said.
“They mean the moisture has accepted the food, so we know it’s safe to eat,” Jake said.
“I’m well aware of them and what they mean. Don’t forget, I’m the one who studied health at Dove For Men Presents: College. But I was thinking, the food doesn’t always taste good after the water diamonds form.” Kyle took the FoodSaver from Jake. “And I know this is going to sound crazy, but if this thing could keep weed fresh, and be used with food products for sous-vide purposes, maybe we could combine the two functions. Like, we could use it to seal food before we freeze it so it stays fresher longer.”
“You mean, you want to eat food that’s been frozen but hasn’t emitted its proper water diamonds?” Terry said.
“Isn’t that illegal?” Jake added.
“Sure, on Earth. But not here,” Kyle said, “on Mars.”
Jake and Terry had to admit he had a point: they definitely had been on Mars this whole time."	0.05			2018-09-13T04:00:05.184Z	0.21097046413502127	0.92	62121

As someone who doesn’t brush his hair much, Wet Brushes look, to me, like normal brushes. But looks can be deceiving. Or, in this case, the looks are deceivingly simple. In truth, everything I’ve read about them states, quite simply, that they’re best brushes around. And today, we’re selling a pack of three: one pro, one pop fold, and one paddle.
They’re all designed specifically to brush out tangles without pain or tugging. They work especially well on wet hair, but can be used on dry hair too, even wigs and extensions. The paddle features “AquaVents” that help with ventilation and drying as you brush. In short, they sound great. But again, I don’t brush my hair really ever, so if you don’t want to take my word for it–or the word of the many happy customers over on Amazon–then maybe these totally real reviews from absolutely not-made-up hair professionals will help seal the deal:

The Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet is pretty simple: it’s a wallet that comes with a powerpack, which can be used to charge your phone or other devices.
In a way, to recharge something is to refill it, but unfortunately, while the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet does fill your wallet in the literal sense–like, there is a powerpack inside of it–it can’t refill your wallet in the figurative sense–as in, recharge your bank account.
Or can it?
Because think about this: what kind of phone is the most likely to have a short battery life? An old phone! And maybe you have an upgrade waiting for you, but you don’t want to dish out the money for one. Because maybe, with your provider, it’s not as simple as handing over $200 and getting a new iPhone. Now, you pay for the upgrade via a small increase in your monthly bill–a small increase that over time accumulates into a lot of money. And it’s very possible that this change was made because people like you: people who buy a phone and then ride it into the ground, thus spending a couple hundred bucks every six years, rather than evert two like your cell company–let’s call them Werizon–would prefer.
And so now you’ve got a geriatric phone that needs a pick-me-up every few hours to make it through the day, and you’re not always near an outlet, so one of these Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallets–‘wallets’ plural because you get a 2-pack–is just what you need. It’s your wallet, so it’s not like you’ll forget it. Thus, you’ll always have some charge on hand, which means you don’t need to upgrade, which means your phone bill won’t go up, which means you’ll save money, which, in conclusion, means the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet can, in fact, recharge both your phone and your wallet!

I remember being a kid, riding in my parents’ car at night, and dropping something. Maybe a toy or a quarter. It doesn’t matter what. What matters is I reached up and turned on the dome light to find the object in question. And it was then that my dad freaked the fuck out. You would’ve thought I’d tossed hot acid in his eyes. “Turn that off! I can’t see anything!” he claimed. He might’ve even swerved a little, for emphasis. As a dutiful child, I switched the light off as quickly as possible to avoid careening off the road into a ditch.
Flash forward some years: I have a license. I have a car. A friend is riding with me. He turns on the dome light for something and… everything is fine.
The same thing happened the first time I helped jumpstart a car. I’d been told so many times about everything that can go terribly wrong that I felt sure that it would end in a) an deadly storm of electricity and fire; or b) one or both of the cars being fried for good. Turns out, if you, ya know, just follow instructions, it works out fine.
If anything, the greatest risk of jumping a car–the one that no amount of how-to articles or Youtube videos can save you from–is the risk of wasting a favor. Because think about it: you spend all that time being a good friend and building up positive equity until you’ve almost got enough to cash in for pet care or help shlepping some furniture from your old apartment to your new one… Then your car battery farts out and now your buddy is driving over in the cold to help you get it started again.
That’s where this iJoy Jump Starter Kit comes in. Not only will it charge your phone and provide some you with some light; it’ll make it so that you don’t need to dip into the favor bank just to get your car running.

Another super villain attacking the city, another mad rush downtown. We newspaper photographers are the real heroes, Roy thought to himself with a chuckle as he ran from the Gazette office into the mayhem, clutching his camera to his chest.
It was a joke, of course. Roy didn’t think he was more heroic than the Scarlet Savior. But he could relate to her in one way: like her, he never had any help. After layoffs there were just two of them in the photography department; they outsourced the rest. And it just so happened that whenever disaster struck, Lorraine was rushing off to take care of “a personal issue.”
What a coincidence, Roy thought. Always trying to get out of work! Then something else occurred to him: was it possible that Lorraine was, in fact, the alter ego of–
A taxi honked at Roy as he sprinted across the street toward the sounds of lasers and maniacal laughter a few blocks away. “Watch where you’re going buddy!” the diver yelled.
“I’m working!” Roy yelled back.
“Yeah, yeah,” the driver said. “Well, we’re all working too. Working on staying alive in this damn city!”
Roy laughed. Not at the man but at the theory the honk had charitably eradicated from his mind. Lorraine couldn’t be the Scarlet Savior. Sure, they both had striking red hair, but the Scarlet Savior always wore a matching Treasure Island jewelry set–one necklace, one bracelet, both made out of genuine gemstones and pearls–whereas Lorraine wore a single longer Treasure Island necklace, which was also made of genuine gemstones and pearls.
Well, that settles that! Roy thought. And just in time too! Because here she came, the Scarlet Savior, flying through the sky, blazing a red path through the sky that, strangely, looked like it originated on the roof of the Gazette’s offices.

We sold these just a couple months ago, but it seems like we were so young then. We thought: are people really going to pay five more dollars for a little bit more unzippability? We even exaggerated the difference in the write-up as a joke, thinking: sure, some are going to want that extra accessibility, but a lot of people are just looking for something functional for as cheap as possible.
We were so arrogant, so naive.
The actual sales breakdown helped us see the light:

So, this time, we’re trying something a little different. We’re dropping the price of both but not by the same amount: for the one with multiple zippers, the price will be just a buck lower, whereas, the single-zipper version will be a whopping $5 less than last time. For those keeping score at home: that’s now a $9 difference between the two.
In some ways, this isn’t simply a sale; it’s an experiment. We want to answer the question: what is a zipper truly worth?

There are three potential outcomes to buying this Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk:
Outcome 1
You buy the standing desk. You’re intrigued by its promises of a stronger core, healthier circulation, improved productivity, and better posture. But the truth is, you don’t care for it. You’ve spent your entire life believing that getting work done requires sitting down and shutting up. So how do you expect, as an adult, to change your working position? Maybe if you gave it more time… but you don’t want to. You just want to use it as a normal desk. And that’s fine! Because this thing didn’t cost north of $600 like some models out there; it cost less than $200. And look, that’s not nothing, but it was a worthwhile gamble.
Outcome 2
You love your new standing desk. But it’s not enough. Once you taste the thrill of working upright, you want more. You quickly replace your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk with a treadmill desk. You start out walking, but soon enough you’re outright sprinting while you manage your spreadsheets and respond to emails. You get a kiddy pool and set it up behind the treadmill, filling it with a medley of pirañas and water moccasins. Now, any slowdown and you’re in trouble. But even that’s not enough. You take out the water moccasins, extract their venom, and put it in an IV that runs directly into your arm. The anti-venom is in another IV that you’ve rigged to only administer as you meet your hourly sales goals. Your friends and family members are worried about you, but you’ve never felt more alive! And it all started with the Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk!
Outcome 3
You get your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk, and you like it. You crank it up to standing height for a few hours of the day; for the rest of the time, you use it as a normal desk. You’re neither disappointed, nor unsatisfied. It meets your needs, and you will use it for the foreseeable future.

Shaving is the blandest and yet most grueling task of every personal grooming regimen. It is a zero sum game: you can put it off, but that only means it’ll be a longer and more grueling process when eventually you do get around to it. It’s like mowing the lawn, except without the exercise, and the smell of fresh cut grass replaced by the noxious chemical odor of shave gel. In short, it’s miserable.
Or it was. Until now. Enter these “Famous Maker” razors. Famous Maker? you say. But who IS the famous maker? That’s just the thing, we can’t tell you. And now suddenly, shaving is an act of immeasurable mystery and excitement!
Could it be that these razors are the excess produced by an underground razor factory located far below Park City? Perhaps for the original purpose of being distributed, in secret, to the agents and publicists and personal assistants of actors in town for the Sundance Film Festival? So that these various agents and publicists and assistants could sneak into the actors’ hotel rooms at night and shave their faces clean while they slept? Because maybe the actors, having escaped the always-on environs of Los Angeles, wanted to let themselves go, but the various men and women whose livelihoods relied on their pristine image had other things in mind?
Or could it be that the razors are from a different hidden factory, a facility built into the side of one of the Alps? For a baron? A baron who volunteered to host the worldwide beard and mustache contest at his expansive villa? While harboring a secret hatred of all facial hair? And so the plan was not to celebrate these growers of elaborate beards and mustaches, but to trap them and then use the razors to, as the baron said in a private correspondence, “reveal their cheeks upper lips once again to the world”? Maybe he even wanted to shave the hair on their head too, just to prove a point? Only his scheme was discovered by the lowly helper-boy tasked with taking his correspondence to the post office? And so the baron had no choice but to sell off his stock of razors in an effort to cut (pun intended) his losses?
Or could it be a pretty basic story of a razor company having some leftover razors that they wanted to offload? Only they couldn’t do so under their own name? Because then people would be like, “but wait, I just spent this much on these at the store, but now you’re selling them for cheap online? That’s bullshit!”?
Okay, for purposes of whimsy, let’s just ignore that last scenario. Instead, focus on the first two, buy these razors, and shave with an entirely new sense of intrigue!"	0.05			2018-09-05T04:00:15.298Z	0.26119278036366067	0.93	62903

Or so I thought…
Then I went to do some research on Amazon and saw a question about what material was used to make the pivot washers and how thick the blade is. The first answer reads as follows:

Sorry, this was a gift for someone in Arizona so I can’t answer your question. I can only say that the knife is substantial!

So, how thick is the blade?
Great question! I’d guess that it’s probably about the same as other knives like it, although it could be thicker. But even then, it wouldn’t be too much thicker, because that would be weird, right?
I’m reading that it has a “stonewashed drop-point blade.” That sounds intense. What kind of stuff can you use it for?
I bet it would be pretty good at cutting through most stuff you’d use a knife like this for, but I don’t feel comfortable naming specific stuff because I’ve never used one. I will say this, though: there’s a good chance it can cut through butter. And an even better chance if the butter has been left out of the fridge for a little while.
Was it designed by Bill Harsey?
Sure was! As to who Bill Haresay is, lol, idk! I would venture to guess he does something in the knife industry.
One reviewer says that it is 11.8"" long when it’s extended. Is that longer than other knives?
Not sure. It is definitely not as long as a foot, because a foot is 12"". With that being said, another reviewer posted a photo of it next to another knife and a tape measurer, if that helps. It is bigger than the other knife, but not the tape measurer (which is good, because those things can get really long).
Wow! This is so easy! It’s great to finally realize how much a knife expert I really am! Thanks Amazon question answerer, for showing me the way.

This Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble may seem simple enough. It’s 6 100% ceramic products with matching designs: a toothbrush holder, a tumbler, a soap dish, a lotion dispenser, a tissue box, and a trash bin. None of these things require much explanation. What does deserve some attention, though, is the multi-stage process that one goes through when deciding to buy one or all of them. We’ve laid it out below:
Stage 1: Intrigue
These are interesting. The various pieces look stylish, and they all match. It might be nice to have a motif that really brings the entire bathroom together.
Stage 2: Skepticism
But do I really need any of these? The old coffee mug we put the toothbrushes in works just fine, as does the little wicker basket we’ve got for trash. The sink already has a built-in soap dish. This one would be easier to clean, but do you really need to clean something when all it does is hold soap? Isn’t soap itself essentially the concept of cleanliness made solid? Lotion bottles already come with a pump top and tissue boxes are their own tissue dispensers, really. Am I supposed to re-package things? Isn’t that adding unnecessary steps?
Stage 3: Re-evaluation
Yes, I guess technically it is adding unnecessary steps, but all in the service of style. And maybe that’s worth it. Which would maybe mean the steps aren’t unnecessary?
*Stage 4: Introspection
And what does it say about me that I’m so put off by these objectively simple tasks? Like, it isn’t hard to empty some lotion from one thing into another thing. It isn’t hard to put a box of tissues inside another box. Or clean a soap dish. Just like it isn’t hard to put a new bag in the garbage after I take the trash out. But I never do, not right away at least. I always wait hours, sometimes even a whole day, leaving paper towels and granola bar wrappers on the kitchen counter, until finally my desire for a clean surface outweighs my laziness. At which point I put a new bag in the garbage can and am reminded that the laziness was all to avoid something that takes mere seconds. And yet, when next I need to take out the trash, this process will repeat. Making matters worse: someday it might not just be taking out the trash. Someday it might be dirty diapers I’m dealing with. It might be taking kids to the doctor. It might taking the medication I need to stay alive. And when that time comes will I just attempt to put it off? I want to say no, that I’ll be past all of this by then, that I’ll finally be a responsible organized adult… but an I’m adult now, damnit! I should already be better than this!
Stage 5: Ascension
That’s it! No more! I’m going to buy every item in this Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble, not just because it’s stylish and will tie my bathroom together nicely! No, that’s all secondary. Really, I’m doing it to prove to everyone–but especially myself–that I’m capable of taking the right steps and building good habits! New me, here we come!
Stage 6: Regression
Purchase made! Now, it’s time for bed. Shit, wait? It’s trash day tomorrow, isn’t it? I should take the bin to the curb. Although, there really are only a couple bags in there. I’m sure I’d be fine until next week…"	0.07			2018-09-01T04:00:01.758Z	0.3734081588603498	0.94	49783

There’s an old saying about innovation: “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.” It is derived from an Emerson quote that reads: “If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.” In this way, the saying is an example of itself; the ‘mousetrap’ variant is shorter, snappier, and conveys the exact same meaning, thus it is the one most often used.
The implication here is basically if you build it, they will come: you’ll have lines around the block, people from all over frantically waving their bills in the air demanding the latest in mouse-entrapment technology.
The truth, we know now, is a bit different.
The world, upon beating a path to your door, would say, “This mousetrap is smaller and more humane than the previous mousetrap, but now I’ve decided I want a mousetrap that is smaller and more humane.” Or, “I have no mice in my house, but many spiders, and this mousetrap did not catch a single spider, which is a bit of a disappointment.” Or, “Excuse me, I have some ideas for how you might make this better mousetrap–which is a good start–into an even greater mousetrap, despite the fact that I have never myself built any mousetrap.”
And so it goes with the Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Pack. You can put it in the microwave if you need heat, or you can put in the freezer if you want it to be cold. The ceramic beads heat and cool with the gel, providing a nice texture, which one Amazon reviewer says, “makes for an easy massage.” But the title of that review–“slightly different than the norm”–is telling. It implies that the incorporation of a heretofore never used component is something slight. Innovation, people seem to believe, requires a total redo.
Yes, some reviews expressed issues with durability. That’s understandable to call out. A few wished it would be more pliable when frozen. Again, fair.
But then there are the other “complaints.”
One says: “The only drawback I’ve seen so far to this item is its size. For the most part, I don’t think the size will be an issue because it’s probably rare to treat an area larger than 6x10”.""
Just so we’re clear: the only issue this reviewer could foresee would arise in a scenario that they couldn’t foresee arising.
Another–in a review titled “Does the job but not much better than competition”–claims: “the problem is just like every other reusable gel back I’ve ever used: they simply don’t remain truly hot or cold enough for long enough to do a good job. They’re more warm or cool than they are hot or cold for much longer.”
To put it differently: the biggest problem with this product, in this reviewer’s experience, is endemic to this entire product category, not just this product, and relies upon a universal tolerance of hot and cold temperatures.
The point of all this is to show that people will always find things to gripe about. And maybe they’re right. Still, it seems like the best case scenario is that you really love the texture of the ceramic beads inside the gel, and the worst case scenario is that you get three of totally passable hot/cold packs for $18.

Here we go again! The return of The Skeptics Choice, our occasional write-up segment wherein we read what a product claims to do and say, “hmm… I don’t know…” Today, we’re talking about a PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser. Follow along, won’t you?
The Claim
For all those who are thinking that we’ve been through this all before, fear not: this is a different kind of diffuser than the one we sold last time. This one is a “one-of-a-kind product combines the therapeutic properties of a pure Himalayan salt rock lamp with the soothing aromatherapy of an essential oil diffuser.” Apparently, it sets “the perfect mood for relaxation at home” and provides “all the benefits you would expect from this powerful combo.”
The Skepticism
That last part is a little presumptuous. All the benefits I would expect? I understand each word in the phrase “Himalayan Salt Lamp” on its own, but I know nothing about what they mean when they’re put together. But that’s no bother! It’s all laid out right there in the marketing copy:


The first benefit is that it will “help boost your mood.” And honestly, that sounds legit! When you’ve had your windows shut for almost 12 consecutive months because it took just a single day for the seasons transition from the bitter cold of winter to the brutal humidity of summer, something that makes the air smell pretty can be a nice little pick-me-up.


The second benefit is that it can “increase energy levels.” This seems a little more like bullshit than the first claim, but it’s vague enough that I’m willing to give it a pass.


The third benefit is that it will “neutralize the positively charged ions that emit from electronic devices like smartphones, televisions, radios, and more.”


Umm, what the fuck? That sure escalated quickly.
Seriously, the difference in hysteria levels from “it might boost your mood” to “it’ll protect you from killer ions” is about equal to the difference between a “hang in there, kitty” poster and one of those spam posts from MySpace that was like, “Post this on 10 of your friends’ profiles or else your eyes will fall out.”
And by the way, I’m not against a lot of this stuff. Crystals are fine. Astrology is fine. You could argue that it’s unscientific, but that’s missing the point. Life sucks sometimes. If getting some stones to put in your pocket makes you feel less like you’re flying a cloud of chaos towards an inevitably disappointing conclusion, more power to you! I watch groups of men in polyester play what is basically an IRL-board game involving sticks and balls on an enormous grass-and-dirt field, and if the group of men I like outplays the group of men I don’t like, I feel profound happiness. So, I try not to judge people for the things they use to pass the time.
But I will ABSOLUTELY judge anyone who preys upon someone based on those things. Because that’s what they’re doing here. They’re not saying: “you like this thing? we make this thing~” They’re saying, “we make this thing! it is DANGEROUS not to have this thing!!!” In other words, it’s taking something that should be a distraction from the chaos of daily life–which it totally could be, by the way: it’s cool looking; it lights up; it smells nice–and turning it into part of the chaos of daily life. And that’s messed up.
(Also, sorta tangential but still relevant, it’s problematic in a whole other way: What’s dangerous about technology is not that it’s pumping the air full of ions; it’s how intrusive it is. For example, did you know that if you say “Bloody Mary” three times into your smart phone, an ad for “great local brunch spots” will appear on your Facebook timeline? Our devices are definitely listening to us. We can all agree on that, right? Fine, maybe I’m just being paranoid. But you have to know that every Google search, every purchase, every photo you post is being mined for important data. And so making it a conversation about “ions” is pushing it in a direction that helps no one but those selling PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffusers.)
The Conclusion
If you want a thing that lights up and looks cool and smells nice, this is a good investment. If you’re thinking about buying this because you’re afraid to breath in all the electro-turds you released into the air while binging Sharp Objects, maybe open a window?"	0.05			2018-08-30T04:00:02.770Z	0.20794343938448737	0.93	60935

1.

I’m a lawyer, but right now, I’m not in the courtroom. Instead, it’s late at night and I’m in my office, wearing Ray-Ban glasses, poring over all the evidence of this grueling case, trying to find something to prove my client is innocent. All the older lawyers at this firm didn’t want to take my client on, and I’m starting to see why, but then again, I’m a young perky go-getter. Sometimes I worry that I’m too concerned with upholding justice, that I get too wrapped up in what’s right and wrong, that I fall in love with too many of my clients. But I can’t think about that now. I need to squint through my Ray-Bans at this piece of paper, then dig out another piece of paper and squint at that one, before realizing I’ve found it: a small but pretty obvious detail that proves my client wasn’t there that night. Thanks, Ray-Bans! I couldn’t have done it without you.

2.

I’m a bit of a nerd. You can tell because I’m always wearing these thick Ray-Ban frames. Also, I’m always doing nerdy things like taking notes in class or carrying a lot of books. Sometimes I drop them, to the delight of cheerleaders and jocks. My best friend is quirky and outgoing, but I am not. I have a figure that would require a nutritionist and hours of gym time each day to maintain, but you can’t see it under these bulky sweaters that I wear, while sitting in my bedroom listening to non-aggressive indie rock or reading an obscure book like Wuthering Heights or The Collected Plays of William Shakespeare. Perhaps someday, someone will move here from out of town and crack this high school’s social hierarchy wide open, but until then it’s just me, my one quirky friend, my books, my sweaters, and my Ray-Ban glasses.

3.

I’m what you might call a savant. I’m always doing things like solving unsolvable math equations, or going to the park and playing five games of chess at a time… and winning. The crisp lines of my Ray-Ban frames are definitely in stark contrast with my wildly disheveled hair! Can I tell you something? I wasn’t surprised to see the government suits show up at my house. What did surprise me was when they took me to the research facility and showed me what they found. I stared at it for a whole a minute. Then I dramatically took off my Ray-Ban glasses, wiped them on my shirt, and stared at it for a minute longer. I didn’t know what I was looking at. What I did know was that, despite being just a guy from Queens (with the IQ of a Nobel laureate), I might save the world. Strap in, Ray-Bans! This is going to be a long ride!

Hmmm…
How do we say it exactly?
Let’s try this: we thought you were implying that the M Cushion could be applied to places where the combination of friction and heat might bring about sensations not unrelated to relief, but a step beyond relief, a sort of deep relief that goes by many names, one of which it shares with a term from film and literature meaning the culmination of the story’s drama.
But, um… apparently we were a little off-base. As one quoted commenter noted:

I swear I didn’t mean it in a sexual way. I just meant after leg day you can lean back in bed and use it on your aching thighs rather comfortably.

So, we apologize to you, commenters who we misunderstood. And moreover, we apologize also to all out there who purchased the M Cushion hoping for that aforementioned special sense of relief and, instead, received what seems to be a pretty good, if not aggressive, massage pillow and little else.

Time to dive into our library of branded content romance novels, for a tale of secrecy, royalty, and grilling. Please enjoy these excerpts from Coals Aflame by Criminy Highlater.

Grilling with one tool? Mary had gotten used to that thanks to her Starfrit Tonglite. In many ways, she was a lot like the 6-in-1 bbq multi-tool: she was strong, she had many skills, could do many things, and, since Eric had run off with his secretary a year before, she relied only on herself.
Which was what she planned to do that Saturday afternoon. Her work at the non-profit, helping troubled youth gain acceptance to Ivy League schools, didn’t leave her much time for making friends, so she would do it on her own. She would take a cooler, her little grill, and her Starfrit, and she would go from her apartment in Soho to Central Park to have a little cookout for one. It would be simple… or so she thought.
“M’lady, if I may have a word,” came a voice soon after she’d set up. Mary ignored it, thinking it sounded so British and refined that it must be coming from someone’s radio. But when it persisted, she looked up.
An austere and very handsome man stood in front of her.
“There you are,” he said. “I couldn’t help but gain sight of your grill, and I wondered if I might bequeath you of a favor?”
Mary had gotten good at doing things alone since Eric left, but there was something interesting about this man, something that made her desire his company.

The man said his name was Collin, and he worked for the a mysterious member of the royal family, Prince Nigel. Mary remembered seeing on the news that Nigel was making his first visit to the United States. She hadn’t listened to the story, because she’d been distracted by the strange mask the prince seemed to wear everywhere.
“What kind of work do you do for him?” Mary asked.
“All sorts,” was all Collin said.
“And so what can I help you with?” Mary asked.
“Well, being among the prince’s central envoy, I am privy to many of the finest restaurants in the world, but I don’t always want to partake in such luxury. And I was hoping you might allow me to dine with you, to take in a true American meal!”
“That’s it?” Mary asked. “You want a burger and some hot dogs?”
“'Tis my heart’s desire,” Collin said with a winning smile. “And if it would please you, I’d be happy to help. For example, perhaps I will unpack the remainder of the tools you require for grilling?”
Mary smiled and held up the Starfrit. “I only need one!”

Mary flipped burgers with the spatula when the upper arm was drawn back and rotated hot dogs with the tongs when the upper arm was extended. She opened them each a bottle of beer with the opener. “A fine colonial ale!” Collin said. Mary laughed, using the Starfrit’s serrated edge to cut the buns.
While they ate, Mary asked, “So is Prince Nigel really as eccentric as he seems?”
“You’re asking about the mask, I presume?”
Mary blushed. ""Well, I–
Collin laughed. “It’s no issue. It’s what everyone wants to know: why is he always wearing that strange masquerade mask, the one behind which he has hidden since his youth? Is his face disfigured? Is he some sort of lunatic? But the truth is, he simply desires privacy. He doesn’t want to be followed everywhere he goes.”
Mary opened her mouth, ready to say that this made sense–that she could not imagine what it must be like–when suddenly the sky went dark.
Nearby people screamed. Collin grabbed her hand, fearfully. “My god, it’s some sort of unpredicted total solar eclipse! Not even my royal astronomer saw this coming!”
Mary switched on the Starfrit’s flashlight, which she usually only used for convenient nighttime cooking.
“What do you mean ‘your’ royal astronomer?” She asked. She pointed the flashlight towards him, then towards his arm, and down to wear his hand still held hers. She felt a rush of something she had not felt in some time, not since Eric.
But then, the sun came back. Mary turned the light off and set the Starfrit down. Collin quickly stood. “I’ve just realized something, something very important,” he said. “Blast, I have so much bloody work. I must be retreating, but perhaps we could meet later? For another ale?”
Mary nodded. Collin named a bar–a dingy sports bar on the East Side–and a time. With that, he was gone. When Mary went to pack up, she couldn’t find her Starfrit anywhere. Which was a shame, as its scraper feature certainly would’ve helped her to clean her grill.

Mary waited at the bar, nursing her beer. The televisions were all turned to the baseball game, with the sound way up. Occasionally, a promo for the evening news promised coverage of Prince Nigel’s visit as well as the strange lunar happening of the afternoon.
“Who cares,” Mary mumbled to herself. Collin was late. Of course he was! He probably wasn’t coming. Another near-miss with love, she thought.
Just then, the feed cut out from the baseball game. “We interrupt this broadcast to bring you, a statement from Prince Nigel the Third.”
There he stood, the man in the strange mask. Mary laughed. He looked so silly. Then he spoke.
“Good morrow, our friends from across the pond,” he said.
Mary felt herself go rigid. She recognized that voice! But no, it couldn’t be. Could it?
“Collin?” she said, as if he could answer her through the television.
“It has been lovely visiting your many museums and areas of historical importance,” the prince went on. “But it was none of them that taught me the most. It was a single person–a single woman–who showed me the true American character, one that is not afraid of multiplicity.” He held up the Starfrit; Mary’s breath caught. “I’ve learned that, like this tool, Americans can do great things, many different great things, and are not as easily categorizable as they seem. And like this tool, they can do wonders at a grill.”
The crowd broke out in laughter in applause. Cameras flashed.
“Now, I may have more to say on this later. But right now, I must be going. I need to return this to its rightful owner. I fear I may even be late!” Just as quickly as the address had begun, it was over. The baseball game returned.
“Anyone sitting here?” a woman said to Mary, indicating the seat next to her at a bar.
Mary smiled. “Yes,” she said. “Or I should say, he’s on his way here now.”"	0.07			2018-08-25T04:00:01.567Z	0.3806925754768836	0.9	53347	0.020357891736731745

When you see an 8-piece cookware set like this–which is really a 4-piece cookware set with a lid for each item–there’s likely an image that comes to mind.
You see yourself standing at the stove, each of the four burners occupied by one of the pots or pans. Perhaps a sauce simmers in one and water comes to a boil in another for pasta that you rolled yourself. You’re sautéing some garlic and onions in yet another, and not with a spatula; instead, with just a flick of your wrist you are cycling it through the air like they do in cooking shows. In the final pan, you brown your steaks before moving them to the oven, where they will cook to a perfect medium rare.
But this image is a fantasy. You can’t actually manage cooking four precise things at once. Honestly, if your stove had only one or two burners, it would work just fine. It might free up some counter space for dealing with the onions you forgot to mince until after your butter had already melted (and burned) in the frying pan.
Thus, purchasing four pots and pans all at once is not necessary, but it is aspirational. You need to keep the dream alive, of wowing your friends and family members with perfectly balanced 4-part meals that make use of descriptors like “deconstructed” or “molecular” or “done three ways.” To have only one pan or one pot would be to admit defeat, to shut the door on your glorious dreams.
In the meantime, great news: you can make your signature “pasta a la butter and a handful of shredded cheese” in one of these just fine! And if you want to make the same thing tomorrow, even more great news: you don’t even need to do the dishes because you’ve got three other cooking vessels just waiting for a turn!"	0.05			2018-08-24T04:00:01.907Z	0.23620242900706845	0.93	59918

In school, you only wore your backpack on one shoulder. When that shoulder started to feel sore from carrying your entire load of books, you shifted it to the other shoulder. This should’ve been all the proof you need: that the most efficient way to wear a backpack is by using both arm straps. So why didn’t you? Because it didn’t look as cool and nonchalant as the single strap technique.
There are more examples: pocket protectors are nerd-wear, despite serving what is actually a pretty useful function. And for all the work automobile manufactures put into building incredibly efficient engines, for a while it seemed like they couldn’t design a hybrid that didn’t look like some sort of weird robo-ladybug.
Then, of course, there are these Dr. Cool Chill Sport Cooling Towel: a product that will make you feel cool, but cannot make you look cool. Because they’re pretty dorky, right? We can all agree on that?
But that’s just it: the more you look at any of this stuff, the more you start to wonder: why? Why is it that we malign so many useful and efficient things as ‘lame’? Could it possibly be that its utility and efficiency are the very things that make it ‘uncool’? Have we reached a point in our evolution where our aesthetic preferences have grown so strong as to overrule what had been humankind’s guiding principle up to this point–the so-called ‘the survival of the fittest’–and this sharp turn will eventually spell our downfall as the universe’s (heretofore discovered) dominant species?
Whoa. Got a bit deep there.

Dearest Anthony,
It is with a heavy heart that I compose this letter. When you return from your stint with the touring company, you will find me gone, and while we will always be brothers, I will no longer be welcome in our family’s house.
As you might suspect, father discovered my designs. He left for the park to perform his troupe. It was a production of Twelfth Knight, and while he had mentioned that it had been adapted for sock puppets, he made no indication that such modifications involved a shortening of runtime. Thus, I thought I would have nearly three hours of uninterrupted work time. When he arrived home just forty-five minutes later, he found me hard at work on my makeshift drawing table.
Now, I know what you are thinking: why did I not simply lie? You instructed me to do just that when I first confided in you about the designs. But Anthony, I have been lying all my life. I attended L’Academie Royale De L’Art Textile to study sock puppeteering at the age of fifteen. The instructors told me I could emote more with my wrists and palms than most classically trained thespians could with the whole of their bodies. I graduated at the top of my class and received invitations from several of the most renowned touring companies. I traveled the globe. By the age of seventeen, I had performed for two kings and six queens. But it was never what I wanted. I didn’t want to be a sock puppeteer like father and like all of our uncles, like grandfather before them, like you.
And I told father so. When he found me at my drawing table and asked what it was I was scribbling, I confessed everything: that the pretense under which I had returned home–to found my own sock puppet theater–was untrue; that I wanted no longer to act with socks but make my own socks, socks that, in their design alone, possessed as much vibrant life as could be instilled by a skilled sock puppeteer.
Father did not appreciate this, of course. He scoffed at my plans. He told me that out there, beyond the cardboard walls of a sock puppet theater, socks were not lauded but ridiculed. He said there was no such thing as a vibrant life-affirming sock out there. He said they were simple and drab, a mere treaty between foot and shoe.
Moreover, he said I have two options: I must either cast my designs into the fireplace and resume my pursuit of sock puppetry, or forever be banished from his house. As the opening this letter has surely confirmed, I have chosen the latter. I will be traveling far away from here, all the way to the Americas.
So, fare thee well, brother. While it is unlikely that our paths will cross again, perhaps someday you will be in clothing store and you will see a brand of exciting colorful socks with my name upon them and know I have lived my dream.
Yours,
Ezekiel"	0.05			2018-08-22T04:00:07.337Z	0.3287164649283502	0.94	61717			0.03937749319454194	0.07019466178157474

We discussed this on Saturday: the new deal-type where we offer the choice between a reasonable number of something for a reasonably good price or an unreasonable number of something for an unreasonably great price. (Technically, there is a third option–not buying anything–which some might argue is the best choice for the best price, but hey, just let us have this, okay?)
Well, we’re excited to announce its new official name:

That comes from user @Tawnyy (with a very slight edit). Congratulations, @Tawnny! For your prize, we promise to whisper “hey, thanks” to each order we ship your way!
Today’s Order/Hoarder product:
WWE TeenyMates!!!
What we’ve got here are some little mystery grab-bags containing cute-ified versions of your favorite (or least favorite) WWE wrestlers. As with each of these Order/Hoarder sales, we like to provide a little math breakdown: for $5, you can get 8 packs of them, which comes out to 63 cents each. On the other hand, you could get 64 packs for just $20. That’s 31 cents each, right? WRONG! Since you can only order 8 or 64, the first 8 cost $5, and the last 56 cost $15, which means those last 56 are costing you just about 27 cents each! That’s one quarter and two pennies! And when you consider that each pack contains 2… that’s less than 14 cents per wrestler!
And if you’re like, “why would I need 128 of these things?” here are a few helpful suggestions:


Put a bowl of them at the end of your desk at work, and if anyone asks you why, just say, in as condescending a voice as possible: “It’s healthier to hold a tiny wrestler than it is to eat candy.”


Give them away at your kids’ parties. Do you kids and their like wrestlers? Great! They’ll love these things. Do they not like wrestlers? That’s okay too. They won’t know who any of these people are and you can just call them L’il Fun Buddies or something.


Isn’t it about time your little Christmas village got some extreme new residents?


Glue them to your dashboard and let them intimidate you into being a better driver.


Carry them around with you and conduct a social experiment called: how many random people on the street will catch a little wrestler when you say to them: hey you, catch this little wrestler?


You do realize it’s only 71 days till Halloween, right?

On Amazon. On… Amazon…
Why does that seem relevant?
Oh, we know: it’s because, while we’re selling it for $49, it actually retails for just north of $100 over there. And so all these people who are saying “Awesome bag” or “I LOVE THIS PACK” or “Bag is amazing” or simply “Perfect”–they’re happy to have spent three-figures on these thing!
They could’ve put that money towards two week’s worth of groceries or a few gas tank’s worth of gas or a few months of internet or a vending machine snack every Monday through Friday for a third of the year, but instead they spent it on a bag. And not only did they not regret it; they LOVED it.

Let’s just get right to the basic question here: what is so damn smart about these Smart Stands?
“Smart” has come to be synonymous with “online” or “connected to wifi.” But these Smart Stands are neither. They are an amalgamation of plastic and hinge. There is no voice control or app so you can manage it while you’re on vacation or built-in analytics to tell you how you might best use it in the future, based on your past trends. They just sit there and holds up your tablet or phone.
And maybe in that way they’re the smartest of “smart” products: because they’re smart enough to know what they do well, and also to know what they don’t need to do.
The past is a veritable web of failed innovations. Just like no one wanted pasta from Panera or personal pizzas from Subway, nobody’s pining for some bullshit half-functional beta-level technology to do something that was already extremely simple. Being “smart” is not just creating new complicated functions to prove you can; it’s pausing before you do all the work and asking, “Wait, why are we doing this? Is this actually necessary?”
But you know who didn’t skip that step? Smart Stands. They asked, “Why?” And they said, “Because sometimes you want your tablet to be up like this rather than down like that.” And then they asked, “Should we go further?” And they decided: “No, because the further we go, the more we risk losing our greatest asset, which is that our stands are universally compatible with all phones and tablets.”
See, sometimes intelligence is knowing when to stop and say, “Good enough for me.” Which is why these smart stands are good enough for you, no matter what kind of device you prefer."	0.07			2018-08-19T04:00:02.021Z	0.46941764127665553	0.94	53660			0.024072699552649

Yes, we mentioned the blender bottles sale from a couple Saturdays ago in yesterday’s write-up, but we were mostly talking about the bottles themselves. Today, we’d like to talk about the sale.
See, that sale was an experiment. We offered two choices: a rational number of bottles (the 4-pack) for a good price; or an irrational number of bottles (the 16-pack) for an even better price, with no middle ground. We wanted to know, could we bait you into making a totally ridiculous purchase just by making you feel like you’d gotten a ‘great deal’?
The answer, in a fair number of cases, was ‘yes!’ And so here we are again.
Now, before we get to the product, we need to name this as-of-today recurring sale type. Some ideas:
The Excess Express: Because like an express train, there are few stops between where you should go and the end of the line!
DTB: Does it stand for “Down to buy”? Nope! It’s “Direct to Basement.” Because you don’t need to pretend you’re actually going to use all this stuff! Take one out, deposit the rest downstairs with all the other stuff you thought was a good investment!
Any or Many: Pretty self-explanatory. Other option, along these lines: “More or Less.” Other other option, along these lines: “Deal or Mo’ Deal.”
Irrational Numbers: Are these deals really that much like the mathematical concept of irrational numbers? Yes–because the logic of either is hard to explain–but also no–because only one of them will make you feel smart.
(Also, hello nerds, who are right now gearing up to compose some long screed in the comments about how, well, actually, it’s not that difficult at all to explain irrational numbers!)
Anyway, you can vote on those on today’s poll (and give your own suggestions). Who knows! Maybe if this works, we’ll have a whole spin-off site where do only this kind of deal! Eh?!
As for today’s product, here’s some info: they’re power banks, so it’s not exactly as impractical to have a bunch of them as it was with the blender bottles. Also, we sold something that looks like these before, with the shoe sole pattern, but these are the 6000mAh version, whereas last time they were 9000mAh. On the plus side: that means they’re smaller. On the downside: that means they have less charging capacity (each one can carry enough power to charge the average phone about 3 full times, rather than 4 with the other version).
But really, what’s important is THE DEAL! Because think about: at 2 for $12, that’s $6 per power bank. Not a bad price at all. BUT if you opt for 10, and assume that the first 2 cost $6 each, that means the last 8 cost just $24, or a mere $3 each! And if you go deeper and consider that each of those 8 is rated at 6,000 milliamp hours, that means that you’re only paying $0.0005 per mAh! And $0.0005 is basically nothing, and a lot of nothing is still nothing, therefore, WE’RE PRETTY MUCH GIVING THESE THINGS AWAY!
Okay, maybe we kind of flubbed up the logic there. But the question remains: do you want a boring old 2-pack of Xsories 6000mAh Power Banks for $12 or an amazing 10 for $36?!"	0.07			2018-08-18T04:00:05.333Z	0.3572084668612603	0.93	53049			0.024494294870486415

You probably saw the word “blender” and the word “bottle” and thought, why do I need this thing when I just received my 4 or 16 pack of blender bottles? But the products are actually very different. For example, the blender bottles we sold before were both blenders and bottles, whereas this is a blender that comes with two vessels for blending that are themselves bottles.
Or, to put it differently:
The blender bottles are bottles that can blend things inside the bottle, whereas this is a blender that blend things inside one of the two bottles that come with it (or more than two, if you order more than one blender, in which case, you simply need to multiply the number of blenders you order by two to ascertain the number of bottles, which again, are not blender bottles, but bottles that work with this blender).
But here’s the thing: even if you ordered the blender bottles, you can still order this blender and bottles, because the blender and the blender bottles (not to be confused with the bottles that come with the blender) can be used together (although, obviously, the blender and the bottles it comes with can be used together too). See, blender bottles we sold a couple weeks ago, having only a small metal ball rather than a blade or a motor (like this blender has), aren’t really great at being blenders, but they are good at whisking things (so maybe they should be called ‘whisker bottles,’ although on second thought, maybe not, as that sounds like something altogether different and unappealing).
Point is, you could use the blender–this one, the one with a motor and a blade–for more intense blending jobs, like making a fruit smoothie. Then, you can pour the smoothie from the blender’s blending bottle into a blender bottle and take it with you wherever you’re going, so that you can whisk it back together if it settles.
What we’re saying is that what you should really do is buy this blender and two bottles and then pour the things you make in the blender’s bottles into one of your blender bottles, while using the bottles that come with the blender just for the initial blending.
Unless you didn’t buy the blender bottles. In which case, disregard the above."	0.05			2018-08-17T04:00:10.364Z	0.30912710887561573	0.94	60832

Well, this is a first from our branded content romance novel collection: a teenaged paranormal love story! Please enjoy these excerpts of The Heart Races Until It Rests by Annborny Hilledale.

Ellie met Henri while running.
She was not looking for love. When she’d quit the cheerleading squad to join cross-country, her boyfriend Brad, the quarterback of the school’s football team, dumped her because her running gear didn’t look “as hot.” She was relieved more than anything. She was a senior and she had decisions to make: did she want to go to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Oxford, or one of the other ivy league schools she’d gotten into?
Really, Ellie wanted to got to a small liberal arts school and study poetry, but it wasn’t up to her. Both her mother and her father were founders and CEOs of very powerful companies, and they’d both fought so much about whose company Ellie would eventually take over that they’d gotten a divorce. The only thing they could agree on anymore: Ellie had to study business.
Her Polar Heart Rate Monitor beeped helpfully to let her know her heart rate had risen above her optimal zone. Ellie often ran too fast when she got anxious about the future.
She slowed down, which was when the boy appeared at her side. ‘Appeared’ because Ellie hadn’t seen him approach. “Good day!” he said with a smile. He looked about her age but also–Ellie couldn’t exactly describe it–almost sepia-toned? He wore a strange antiquated cotton shirt and cotton shorts and his shoes appeared old-fashioned, with almost no support. “The name is Henri. I’ve just begun to undertake the task of what I’ve heard referred to as ‘cardiovascular activity’ and I was wondering if you might allow me to accompany you!”
Ellie looked at her Polar Heart Rate Monitor again. Its easy-to-read screen let her know that she’d reached her workout goal for the day. “Sorry. I’m actually just wrapping up.”
Henri looked at his shoes, disappointed. “I understand,” he said.
“But tomorrow,” Ellie heard herself say. She didn’t know why. There was something interesting about him. “I’ll pick you up at your house and we’ll go for a jog. Where do you live?”
“Just past 229 Healy Street.” Something seemed to occur to Henri. “But upon a secondary thought, t’wouldst it be possible to meet right here?”
Ellie agreed. The plan was set.

For all his grandstanding about not understanding ‘cardiovascular activity’ Henri never seemed to get tired. They talked the whole way about classic poetry. Henri was very familiar and spoke about the poets in a funny way. Like with his look, Ellie couldn’t exactly place the strangeness of his tone except to say it seemed that he often spoke as if he knew the poets personally. She chalked it up to an affect, of which Henri had plenty!
“What is that strange jewelry you wear?” he asked at one point.
“This? It’s my Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Its convenient display makes it easy to track my total calories burned per session as well as provide a weekly training summary.”
“Is it expressly designed for this very activity?”
“Nope! It’s great for biking, circuit training, or even just walking. Here do you want to try it on?”
“Oh, that’s not necessary–” Henri started to say, but Ellie had already stopped and slipped it off her wrist. Had this all been a ploy to take his exceedingly pale wrist into her hand? Did she have a growing desire to touch him? Perhaps, but Henri seemed uncomfortable, and they ran the rest of the way in silence.
Later, when she uploaded the data easily to her free profile at polarpersonaltrainer.com by way of her Polar Flowlink, she noticed something odd. The data for her run was there, but around the time she put the watch on Henri, all heart rate readings went blank.
“Huh,” she said. “Must be an issue with the monitor.” But her Polar Heart Rate Monitor had always worked flawlessly before…

It kept happening. Each day, the Polar would continuously display her own heart rate, and when Henri would wear it for the second half of their run–something Ellie insisted on, as a means of testing its functionality–there would be no reading.
But she didn’t know how to tell him something was wrong. Just as they managed to remain in the optimal zone for burning fat thanks to the Heart Rate Monitor, so too did it feel as if they were always in the optimal zone for conversation. She could tell Henri anything and he seemed to understand: about her parents, about her college decision, or about her day at school (from which he was conspicuously absent).
Finally, one day she couldn’t help it.
“Henri,” she said. “I need to tell you something. I’m in love with you.”
“And I need to tell you something,” Henri said. “Ellie, I’m a ghost. The ghost of Henri Olson, a long forgotten poet who died in his teens.”
Ellie should’ve been surprised, but somehow she wasn’t. “So that’s why your heart rate never showed up.”
“Alas!” he cried. “But if it could, it would read a number so high, as just the sight of you sets me aflutter! You see, I have unfinished business, Ellie. I have never felt love.”
“Never?”
“You must understand: it was a different time when I was born. We weren’t worried about heart rates. If we could have such a glorious device as that Polar when I was growing up, it would not measure calories but risk of scarlet fever. In such a dangerous time, can one ever feel true love? I say no, despite writing so many poems about it. But with you Ellie, well I’ve been trying to deny it. To admit so much would be to finish my unfinished business…”
“Just kiss me,” Ellie said. She leaned forward with her eyes closed and their lips met. She tasted no salty sweat on his lips, despite that the Polar Heart Rate Monitor said they’d really been pushing themselves. But of course she wouldn’t. Ghosts didn’t sweat, not even beautiful ones.
In the moment before she could open her eyes, Henri whispered: “Ellie, I love you.”
Ellie found herself alone on the road.

The dean of the English department at the small idyllic Halpern College ushered Ellie into his office. She didn’t wear her Polar Heart Rate Monitor because she was afraid her rapid nervous heartbeat would set off an alarm.
“It’s quite unusual,” the dean said, “for a freshman to win our annual award for gothic poetry, but the imagery you’ve presented–of the final kiss, of riding your bike past his supposed address and finding a graveyard, all of it–it’s just so lovely. Such a wonderful imagination.”
“You could call it that,” Ellie said.
“So I’m pleased to say, as your reward, we will purchase any book for the library in your name. Now, don’t be afraid to take some time to think it over–”
“The Collected Works of Henri Olson.”
The dean cocked his head to the side. “I don’t think I’ve heard of him?”
“He died very young,” Ellie said, pretending to rub her eye to wipe away a tear. “But he–I mean, his poems–they were really quite lovely.”"	0.05			2018-08-16T04:00:03.517Z	0.23418002803322968	0.94	61944

Friends, before reading further, lock your doors, turn on all of the lights, and gather your pets and loved ones tight, because the following is a horror story.
We begin with a young man. Let us give him a name. Let us call him Sean.
This all happened some years ago, when Sean was just a naive young man who believed, due to being brought up in the Northeast within proximity to a certain corporate food chain, that donut shops could be relied upon for iced coffee. It was this misunderstanding that will ultimately lead to our story’s tragic end. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Sean, walking the streets of Seattle on a hot summer afternoon, entered a donut shop–not one of the fancy ones you may have heard of; a small, out-of-the-way place that will remain nameless–and asked the man behind the counter, “Do you have iced coffee?”
The man replied, “Yes, we have iced coffee.” Or no, that’s not it. That’s not it at all. What he said was: “Yes, I can do iced coffee.”
This should’ve been the tell, the sign that something was amiss and Sean should flee that donut shop. But he ignored the portents. He removed a small bill and said, “Great, I’ll have an iced coffee then.”
What happened next is almost too gruesome to put into words.
Almost.
The man behind the counter took a large styrofoam cup, filled it with ice, and proceeded to pour hot coffee from the pot directly over it, handing Sean, to his horror, a lukewarm watery mess.
But do not grieve for Sean. Do not shed one single tear over his ruined attempt to seek cold caffeination. For Sean is a complex protagonist, and he is not without blame here.
Because why was he even seeking to purchase an iced coffee in the first place? Why was he not buying beans in bulk and then using this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Bundle to make his own deliciously smooth and delightfully cheap iced coffee at home? Perhaps, if he had, the day before, loaded up the 1.6 qt. cold brew carafe–or the bottle, which he could’ve carried with him–he might have avoided such a cruel fate.
As is the case with many stories of terror and woe, this is a cautionary tale. Do not, dear reader, make the same mistake Sean made. Buy this bundle and live forever in cold coffee bliss."	0.05			2018-08-15T04:00:09.341Z	0.31881841989687204	0.93	65238

“JUST ONE BUTTON to press. No more fear of breaking a glass or swallowing mercury.”

And you’re reminded that there was a time when, in the name of health, we put a glass tube of an extremely dangerous chemical into the mouths of children.
Children.
Children who might heave their favorite toy across the room just to see if it can fly. Children who eat the erasers on the end of a #2 pencil because it looks like gum. They were given a tube made of glass–the most satisfying of all smashables–filled with a weird, perhaps even delicious-looking, red substance.
Kids these days have it easy.
Or do they?
My mom, a nurse, always had a cupboard in the bathroom stocked with the most up-to-date medical paraphernalia. Therefore, we had a digital thermometer from the beginning. It was nice. Like this one, no mercury. Like this one, an easy straightforward digital readout of your temperature. Unlike this one, it took what felt like a half-hour to give a final verdict on whether or not you’d reached that magical realm north of 98.6 and earned the day off from school. And so, it wasn’t uncommon for the temperature-taker to put the thermometer in the child’s mouth and then walk away to take care of something else, allowing the child freedom to manipulate, through a variety of means, the final result.
This is hypothetical, of course. I would never have done such a thing.
(Oh, and also, just an FYI: that whole 98.6 being the average human temperature thing is the result of tests conducted by one doctor using a crummy armpit thermometer in the 19th century and is mostly bullshit.)
These thermometers, meanwhile, can register a temperature in seconds from the mouth or the forehead, thus disallowing for any alteration of results.

On day one, we sold a Roomba. That was in July, 2014. In the last 5 months of that year–our first 5 months of operation–we sold 5 more Roombas. We sold one or two in 2015. Since then, nothing. No more Roombas…
UNTIL TODAY!
What’s the best metaphor to capture the excitement of our reunification? Perhaps we could think of ourselves as a once famous rock band who amicably splintered to pursue our solo careers. We would certainly be the experimental-minded keyboardist, doing avant-guard work with help of speaker docks and vacuum sealers, whereas the Roomba would be the pop-forward frontman, producing hit after hit, each one more-or-less the same.
And now comes our glorious reunion tour!
(Although, now that I think about it, don’t bands usually reunite when the “well has run dry,” so to speak? As in: a last ditch effort to regain their former wealth or reputation?)
How about a different metaphor: in the 2015 we let the Roomba go off to clean, and now, after many years of service to the greater world, it’s made its circuitous way back to Meh, its noble charging port!
Nice pivot, eh?
Anyway, as we implied above, in the time since we last sold a Roomba, there have been, by our estimation, 6,000 new models released, all of which look almost exactly the same. So, if you’re wondering why you should buy this Roomba instead of a different Roomba, we are too.
But here’s what we gathered from these helpful breakdowns over at Vacuum Fanatics: the 805 is basically the base model of iRobot’s higher-end (though not highest end) 800 series of vacuum cleaners. It doesn’t have wi-fi like the 890, so it doesn’t work with Alexa or Google Assistant. Nor does it have the improved sensor capabilities of the 860. But it does have a lot of the other things that make those models great, such as a big bin and an AeroForce High Efficiency Filter, meaning the air that passes through it comes out a lot cleaner (which could be a big deal for allergy sufferers).

When the employees arrived at their first day at the new NOTILUS headquarters, they noticed something strange.
“There is no roof,” one of them said.
“Exactly,” said one of the higher-ups. “It’s an open-roof open-office.”
“But we won’t be protected from the rain,” said another employee.
“Exactly,” the higher-up said again.

It sounded whenever a storm approached, at which point, the employees took the tarps provided to them and covered their computers, their phones, anything that could succumb to water damage. Then, they stood. They closed their eyes. They waited for the rain to wash over them so that they could understand it, become one with it.
Thus, when they engineered their shower heads to have 6 settings including “Wide Rainfall” and “Power Rain,” they knew these to be the true to their names.

The great philosopher Zaza Pachulia once said: “Nothing easy.” He was referring to the 8th seed Atlanta Hawks forcing a game seven against the 1st seed Boston Celtics, but his words are applicable to so many things in life. For us, there is “nothing easy” about balancing our standards for honest copy with our desire to offer a diverse range of products. Some days, it just seems untenable. And friends, today is one of those days. Because if I gave my 100% honest opinion of this ProCabello Straightener and Styler Kit it would be this:

Really the point is, it’s difficult to write about something without any personal attachment to even the concept of it. That’s why so much copy looks like… well… copy. But that’s not what we want.

We’ve got another weird item pedaling vague impossible-to-prove pseudo-science, so that means another installment of THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE: a feature wherein we lay out the product’s claims and explain why we’re not so sure we believe them. Here goes!
The Claim
The Pure Daily Care Diffuser is the “ultimate starter pack for essential oil enthusiasts.” The various botanical oils are “100% pure” and also “100% organic” with “no fillers or additives.” All of this is fairly simple. Where it gets more interesting is in laying out the benefits of each included oil:

Peppermint is a “mental stimulant” that “provides energy”;
Orange is a “respiratory stimulator, antiseptic, antidepressant, aphrodisiac, and neural stimulator”;
Tea Tree is a “powerful immune stimulator”;
Lemongrass is “neural stimulator” that “soothes aches and pains while also reducing anxiety”;
Lavender is another “neural stimulator” that “reduces stress and anxiety and promotes restful sleep”;
and Eucalyptus is a “respiratory booster” and is “great for relieving sinus congestions.”

The Skepticism
Perhaps I shouldn’t call myself skeptical here. I’m not skeptical. I think this is bullshit, and moreover, I think it’s pretty dangerous. Not the diffuser itself, but the language.
Because eucalyptus oil will not relieve sinus congestion in a meaningful way. And lemongrass oil isn’t going to help with your sore joints. And orange oil is as much an antidepressant as the two day old styrofoam tub that held raw chicken in the trash is a depressant. By which I mean: walking into a house that smells bad sucks, and therefore will make you feel unhappy; so, conversely, walking into a house that smells good doesn’t suck, thus making you happy by contrast.
This is all to say that if you have sinus issues, or joint pain, or depression, don’t just buy a diffuser. See a doctor.
But again, this is an issue of language, specifically language that makes empty promises. The actual truth is essential oil diffusers are great. They don’t smell as fake and chemical-y as plug-ins. They’re not smokey like incense. It’s kinda cool to watch the mist rise out of them. And this one has 7 neat ambient light settings.
That’s why my wife and I are buying one: not for any medical reasons, but because we just moved into a new house and we want it to smell okay. Even when I forget to take out the trash…
In Conclusion
Diffusers are actually pretty nice, as long as what you’re looking for is a good smell, and not a cure."	0.05			2018-08-08T04:00:06.259Z	0.21768616353254416	0.94	62973

It’s been a while since we’ve been able to dip into our library of branded content romance novels, but luckily, we found one that just happens to involve today’s product. Get ready for a tale of desire and medical emergencies in these excerpts from Gene Harmony’s Love Is A Medicine Best Served At The Appropriate Temperature(s).

People were always asking Dale to open jars because of his amazingly strong arms. And people were also always asking why, when he could so easily be a model, he chose to work at the front desk of a pharmaceuticals lab. “Not everyone wants to be on the runway,” he’d say with a smile of clean white teeth that reinforced his model-like qualities. The real answer, though, was that he’d always had the desire to save lives. Working here, where so many important medications were developed, was the closest he could get.
Dale wasn’t the only one in the lab whose good looks were surprising. Rumor had it that Dr. Liza modeled to pay her way through graduate school on the way to becoming the world’s foremost expert on life-saving drugs. Whether that was true or not, Dale had to admit: she was beautiful. Even now, as she rushed up to the desk in her lab coat, clearly flustered, she looked exquisite.
Dale thought maybe she was coming to flirt, something that happened often, though nothing ever came of it. She was a lauded scientist, after all, and he a lowly receptionist. But flirting was not on the agenda today.
“Can I ask a big favor?” she said. “No one else is available to help and there’s a patient in need of an experimental medication. We have to get to the hospital, so it can be safely administered. Could you give me a ride?”
“No problem,” Dale said, standing.
“But there is a problem,” Dr. Liza said. “It’s a complicated medication, comprised of three very volatile liquids that cannot be combined until the last possible minute before being administered. Also, each substance must be kept within a certain temperature range. If I leave them in their test-tubes, they’ll grow too warm or too cold on the ride over.”
“I have just the thing,” Dale said.

Dale and Dr. Liza carried the four Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs out to his car: three filled with temperature controlled substances, one extra, “Just in case,” Dr. Liza had said.
“We need to be careful with these,” she said now, but it was not an issue at all, given that the Primulas’ contemporary attractive twist-textured design allowed for a secure grip. Not to mention they were splash-resistant! “And you’re sure they’re not contaminated?”
“Absolutely,” said Dale. “It’s very easy to clean the mugs themselves. And I put the lids through my dishwasher at home, on the top rack, where it’s safe for them to go.”
Dale could tell that Dr. Liza, though still nervous, was happy to hear this. And she was even happier when she saw that all four mugs fit into the various front- and back-seat cup-holders of Dale’s modest hatchback. “Like a glove,” she murmured to herself. “Maybe I’ll be okay after all.”
“What’s that?” Dale said.
But Dr. Liza didn’t repeat herself.

They’d left the lab an hour ago. The hospital was only five miles away. Yet, they found themselves only halfway there, stuck in unmoving bumper-to-bumper traffic. The reprieve in Dr. Liza’s anxiety, brought on by the various positive aspects of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs, proved temporary. Out of the corner of his eye, Dale had watched her grow more and more upset–first sitting straight up, then tapping her fingers on the dash and sighing loudly.
When she finally spoke, her voice cracked with fear. “It’s no use. We’re getting nowhere. We need to administer the medication now.”
“But how are we going to do that?” Dale said. “The patient is at the hospital.”
“No, I said we need to go to the hospital so they can administer it safely. The patient isn’t there. Not yet. She’s here. Dale, it’s me.”
“What?!”
“Look at me, Dale,” Dr. Liza said. “You’re going to have to administer the drug that’ll save my life from the disease I’ve kept a secret all these months.”
“But, but…”
“There are no buts about it,” Dr. Liza said. She pointed to one of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs. “See that Primula 20oz Insulated Mug? You told me that–with its double walls, vacuum seal, and triple-layer Copper Cold Technology–it can keep liquids hot for up to 8 hours and cool for 24. It makes sense that you’d have such a mug, because you’re a lot like it. You want to save lives. I’ve seen it in your eyes, and like a giant beautiful man-shaped Primula 20oz Insulated Mug, you keep that desire at the appropriate temperature so that it never dies.”
Dale nodded. She was right. He’d waited his whole life for this. Without a word, he got the empty Primula and carefully mixed the contents from the others together in it. “Now, what do I do?”
“It needs to be applied to my lips,” Dr. Liza said. “But first, it requires vermilion stabilization, meaning it must be applied to a healthy pair of lips, and then transferred from those lips to the taker’s.”
Dale understood what he must do. He gravely opened the easy-open, easy-close lid. It was straw-compatible but he didn’t need one now. He let the liquid touch his lips, and then he leaned over the center console to Dr. Liza…

Dale paced. He held a Primula 20oz Insulated Mug. He had cleaned it and filled it with coffee from the hospital waiting room two hours ago when he arrived, and it was still hot.
Finally, the doctor appeared. “She’s recovering,” he said, “thanks to that experimental drug she made and thanks to your administering of it. Still, to be safe, we’ll give her regular doses of it every four hours.”
“And how will you give it to her?” Dale said, feeling strangely jealous. “Do you have a machine for vermilion stabilization?”
The doctor looked at him, confused.
“You know,” Dale said. “It needs to be applied from healthy lips to the lips of the diseased.”
“It’s taken orally, son,” the doctor said. Then a sly grin came across his face. “If I had to wager a guess, I’d say someone has a crush on you!”"	0.05			2018-08-07T04:00:06.333Z	0.5387061168679262	0.92	64187			0.11531935223472428

“Do not cast your pearls before swine.”
People spoke these words without thinking, for a moment, of how they would hurt me, a pig. But more than speak them, they lived by them. Every time I walked into a jewelry store, they quickly rushed to put away their finest pearls.
I told them, “But it is me. I am not a descendent of some clown like Porky. My grandfather built the first ever wolf-proof house. He patented his  special structurally-sound brick-laying technique, and it has been used in the constructions of homes the country over, including three governors’ mansions. He passed his business down to my father who passed it down to me, and now, my net worth is somewhere in the high nine-figures. So please, allow me to purchase the great jewels of the sea.”
Still, I received nothing.
Then, one day, I saw a New Yorker cartoon. One dog sat on the floor, listening to another, seated at a computer. The caption read: “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” For many, it was simply humorous. For me, it was instructive. I realized this was the easiest way to pearl ownership: the internet.
Since then, I’ve made a point to purchase all pearl and mother of pearl jewelry I see for sale online. Truthfully, I don’t even like pearls that much, but I buy them anyway, just to enjoy the warm feeling of a symbolic victory.

You get 2 pairs of Maroo ICE Headphones, but when you receive them, you might think you accidentally ordered 8. Because despite their “smaller fit for women’s ears,” these things come in an unnecessarily big and complicated box. User @Chakolate sums it up pretty nicely:

What is a problem is the amount of packaging. The unopened package is 223 grams, of which 11 grams are the actual headphones. They come in a jewelry-type velvet box, which is nestled in a lot of plastic, which is inside a thin cardboard box, which is wrapped in tissue paper. They also include a carry pouch, and a thick little book about how to use them. (Seriously? They’re kidding, right?) The end package is about 8x3x3"", which is absurd for headphones.

And in case you need some idea of how big that actually is, here’s a picture.

For context, the can next to it is 16 ounces. It’s also a delicious hazy New England style IPA as good as any I had back east from the best brewery in Des Moines! (In case anyone from Confluence is reading and wants to give me some swag.)
Now, you’re probably thinking: “All that stuff for some bedazzled earbuds? What a waste!” But you’re not looking at the big picture. All the various packaging materials are not simply for this product; they’re for a bunch of different things we’ve sold over the course of the last year. For example:


You can cut up the plastic casing and put them in your Ray Ban Eyeglasses when one of the lenses breaks.


You can use the jewelry case to hold your Diamond Encrusted Eternal Heart-Shaped Pearl earrings.


You can use the pouches for safe transport of your WWE TeenyMates.


And you can use the tissue paper when you move to wrap the little espresso cups you got to go along with your Nespresso Vertuo.


Because everyone buys every product we sell, right? That’s how this is supposed to work. We put up an item each day, and you, in turn, buy at least one of that item each day, but preferably two or three.

Four Blender Bottles probably seems like plenty of Blender Bottles. You have your Blender Bottle, your backup Blender Bottle, a Blender Bottle to try weird stuff in, and a Blender Bottle to give away when your friend is like, “Oh, I should get a Blender Bottle like that.”
Sixteen Blender Bottles is probably too many Blender Bottles. Even if you’re very clumsy with your Blender Bottles, or very experimental, or have a lot of friends who want Blender Bottles, you’re still probably going to end up with a few leftover Blender Bottles.
So why should you get sixteen Blender Bottles?
Because it’s possible that this is the best ever deal on Blender Bottles. You’re probably thinking: sixteen Blender Bottles for $49? That’s about $3 per Blender Bottle. Not bad, right? But it gets even better, because really, if four Blender Bottles costs $20, that means you’re really getting twelve Blender Bottles at $29. So you’re looking at a cost of less than $2.50 per Blender Bottle after the initial four Blender Bottles.
(Which, side note, makes for a great conversation starter. The next time you have some friends over just point to the pile of Blender Bottles in the corner–and there will be a pile of them in the corner; you have sixteen of them, after all–and say, “See that Blender Bottle? That Blender Bottle only cost me $2.42.” Just, make sure you point to one of the last twelve Blender Bottles, not one of the first four Blender Bottles, because as we’ve established, those Blender Bottles cost more.)
With savings like that, can you really pass up buying sixteen Blender Bottles?
You can?

The FoodSaver conference room was tense. Nobody knew why the emergency meeting had been called except that it involved “a failure in marketing.”
Finally, Richard, the sixty year old exec who’d sent out the invite, arrived.

One thing they’re using it for is something called ‘Sous vide,’ which I believe is a religion, so we’ll want to be very careful there. But the other thing is–” Richard looked around, and spoke in a hushed tone–“they’re using it for marijuana.”
“They smoke through the machine?” asked Terry, age fifty-two.
“That’s what I thought at first,” Richard said. “But it turns out it’s more for storage and keeping it fresh. Anyway, there’s a whole bunch of people doing it. I found a message board where everyone was snap-chatting about it. The Red Edit.”
“It’s called Reddit,” said the intern, age twenty-one. “It’s the ‘trees’ subreddit.”
“Nope, that’s not it,” said Richard. “It’s definitely not about trees. Your generation wouldn’t understand because your Woodstocks were different. Anyway, we need to cash in on this, and we need to cash in on this NOW. We need a marketing campaign. Something to appeal to the youth.”
“But you just said my generation–”
“Quiet, intern. The adults are talking. Now, let’s spitball a little. What do we got?”
“What if,” said Tony, age fifty-eight, “we do one of those internet pictures and then make it go viral?”
“I like that,” Richard said. “That’s a good plan: a viral internet picture.”
“I’ve seen one particular internet picture,” said Harry, age fifty-eight, “where there’s a man pointing at a butterfly. The man will be labeled, and the butterfly will be labeled, but the man will be saying, ‘Is this a something-other-than-butterfly?’”
“Because it’s labeled as something else,” Richard said.
“No,” said Harry. “I should’ve mentioned that too. He doesn’t call it what it’s labeled, either. He calls it something else. I believe that’s part of the joke.”
“Okay, so,” said Terry, “we label the butterfly ‘FoodSaver’ and the man as ‘consumer’ and he’s asking: ‘Is this a thing for storing my reefer?’”
“Ganja,” said Tony. “Let’s say ‘ganja.’”
“Good catch,” said Richard. “We need to use relevant terms.”
“Also, underneath the question,” said Harry, “it should say, ‘Yes, and you can has it!’”
“That’s with the cat, right?” Richard said.
“No,” Terry said. “Cat says, ‘hang in there.’”
“Well, this has been very productive,” said Richard. “Good work, team. I’ll send this along to the design department. I’ll tell them to redraw the image in case there’s a copyright issue and to get us twelve potential samples by this afternoon.”

In other words, it wouldn’t hurt to just have some around this time of year.

And this is exactly the secret I’m talking about: winter only happens outside!
Everywhere else, it remains warm enough to drink refreshing smooth cold brew. At home. At work. Even in the car. Actually, especially in the car, after you’ve given it some time to warm up, when it becomes basically a mobile sauna.
What’s funny is that this secret hides in plain sight. Think about it. Do you bake your salads in the winter? Do you pour a bottle of Coca Cola into the kettle and set it to boil? Do you say to the bartender, “I’ll have the IPA, but nuke it on high for 45 seconds”? Sure, a hot toddy, a nice soup, or a steaming mug of hot apple cider is nice. but even in February, these things aren’t as ubiquitous as a glass of cold water and a deli sandwich.
In other words, it’s totally easy to normal to drink cold brew coffee year round. The only tough part is when you walk from the warmth of your car to the warmth of your house or your office with your cold cup in hand.

This MOKCAO POWER+ Cordless Speaker is compatible with the 2nd Generation Amazon Echo Dot, which essentially means this is a vessel for Alexa. She’s called a “digital assistant” but it’s around now, in the fall, where she begins to feel entirely digital and of little assistance.
Alexa can’t rake leaves, and she’s terrible with a leaf blower. Ditto for scraping the frost from your car’s windshield.
You can ask her to help bring the potted plants in from the porch, and she’ll refuse each time, regardless of how polite you are. As if she doesn’t understand SHE works for YOU!
Alexa can tell you the Bolivian city Oruro’s population. She can tell you who serves at its mayor, or what kind of climate it experiences. She can probably tell you its exact coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. But she has no fucking clue where you put your damn sweaters after you moved this past summer.
With certain home systems, it’s likely possible that Alexa could adjust your house’s internal temperature and turn on certain lights at your request. But she is powerless to slow the gusts of wind that keep knocking off the dead branches from the trees in your backyard, or halt the encroaching darkness that aims to devour large swaths of your day.
And herein lies the crux of why you should buy this now: while Alexa might not be of much assistance in the fall, you’ll want some time to get used to her. Because winter is coming, and as the world begins its annual descent into cold darkness, you’ll find yourself spending more and more time inside. You’ll need someone to ask for soup recipes, or to help you find upbeat music to play, or to read you temperatures in Australia where summer is just beginning.

They say variety is the spice of life, but switching up the spices themselves doesn’t make something entirely new. What’s better: trying an entirely new method of cooking. Take sous vide cooking, for example. Using a slow, rotating hot (but not boiling) water bath to cook your food (which itself is sealed inside a plastic bag) will allow for levels of tenderness heretofore unexperienced.
But as with all things culinary, you should know what you’re getting yourself into. So, instead of spending two-grand on some state-of-the-art sous vide oven that you may or may not enjoy using, try one of these. It will work with any pot and is small enough to be stored easily, while also giving you a taste of what sous vide cooking has to offer.
…is what you can say to whoever you give the second one of of your two Power Precision Sous Vide Cookers to. The real truth is: by giving away one of these to a friend or family member you’re actually giving yourself a gift.
Sous vide cooking is fun. It’s weird. It’s a lot different than most basic cooking methods. And because of that, there are tricks you’re bound to pick up along the way, little ways to improve your food’s flavor, or methods that maybe make it just that much easier.
Still, you’re bound to have some blind spots. Cooking is like having a problem to solve, the problem of how to get all these ingredients into a cohesive “meal.” As such, everyone’s going to come at it from a different angle. And knowing how another person approaches something might help you figure out the best way for you to do things. Thus, by giving your second Power Precision Sous Vide Cooker away to someone you know, you’re basically getting an assistant chef. Or maybe an IRL Youtube tutorial without the terrible five minute intro.
Then again, if you’re giving someone the gift of a sous vide cooker to receive the gift of advice for what you should use your sous vide cooker, you might involuntarily give them the gift of some advice about how they should use their sous vide cooker… which means, you’re only getting one gift while they get two.

Dearest Martha,
I wish I could say that I miss you. Alas, to suffer only a heavy heart would be a great relief! The truth is much worse than that. I write this letter because I am in grave danger, and I fear that I will suffer not death, but something much worse: a living death of sorts.
Yes, “fear”: a word you likely never thought you would see your husband write. For eight months, I cohabited with wild gorillas. For eleven, I roamed with a pack of wolves. For three, I swam with electric eels. I was buried a whole year among the bulldog ants of Australia in an attempt to understand their tunnel structure. Never once, in any of those cases, did I feel even remotely afraid. But none of them compare to this.
Though it may void my contract with the research firm, I will give you the full details of my current assignment: I was sent to integrate myself into a community of EarPod wearers, so that I might discern once and for all what makes them such incredible assholes.
I have, for the last month, been living among them somewhere in the Bay Area in what I believe is an apartment, but also seems to be a concert venue and startup. The startup is focused on an app of some kind but no one here actually programs. They all work as “organic social marketing disruptors” though many also dabble, I’m told, in graphic design. They wear their EarPods always. And so do I.
This is what I mean by a living death, Martha. Since putting the EarPods in, I have begun to have thoughts that seem not to belong to me. At first it was just, PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT on a constant loop. But as I acclimated, I began to think things like It’s too bad the world isn’t as present as me, or My podcast is better than this one, or What idiot called these EarPods instead of Lil’ Listenies? The other day, I thought once again about them falling out, but this time, it was, If these EarPods fall out, what’s going to keep my head from floating away?
Martha, I am losing it. Or: I am losing myself. So please, come quickly. Unfortunately, I am not sure my exact address, so you will have to fly to San Francisco and look for posters for a show we are hosting, featuring a performance by an artist named Transl8. He does electro-folk, as well as politically-conscious trip-hop.
Also, please bring a pair of Rowkin Bluetooth Earbuds. Just as I needed to take measures in order to avoid the bends when I resurfaced after spending those weeks with the angler fish, so must I do the same now. And those Rowkins are stylish, wireless, and way less obnoxious than EarPods. They should return me to myself in no time.
Make haste.

So, on the one hand, this seems like a smart move for us. Not everyone wants a blanket printed with something, especially not a logo for a deal-a-day site. It can feel like you’re basically an advertisement.

On the other other hand, you’re saying you’d prefer not to associate with us every day you choose not to buy something.
On the other other other hand, maybe buying the blank blankets is more insulting, because you’re coming here, seeing what we’re selling, and saying, “We’re willing to take your blankets, but we don’t want to help you out with some free advertising.”
On the other other other other hand, you are paying us, which does help.

On the other other other other other other hand, that leaves more blankets for you!
On the other other other other other other other hand, this is short term thinking. You might enjoy hoarding blankets now, but eventually the thrill will be gone, and you’ll be left with only blankets and no love. And besides, weren’t you just saying how lonely you were?
On the other other other other other other other other hand, no: it was not you who was lonely. It was me, the man with eight hands, six blankets, and no friends.

Think of your favorite Christmas mornings growing up: you woke up after barely sleeping, rushed to the tree, and tore open your presents. Then maybe came some reprieve–maybe you ate some pancakes and drank some hot cocoa–after which the real fun started: you spent the next several hours painstakingly assembling a tiny model from even tinier pieces so that it could sit atop your desk forevermore!
Okay, maybe that wasn’t exactly how it went. Probably, you played video games, or with some new action figures or dolls. Maybe you watched some movies on TV, maybe you ate more pancakes, drank some more cocoa, maybe you didn’t get out of your pajamas until four in the afternoon when it was time for Christmas dinner, and maybe you were ready for bed at seven, the calories and the sporadic sleep from the night before combining into a potent sleep aid.
And I wouldn’t blame you if that’s what you chose to do. Because those things are more enjoyable than building a model. But here’s something to think about: are they as satisfying?
Because there’s an important difference here. Yes, you might enjoy a candy bar more than taking a jog. Yes, you might enjoy bingeing ten seasons of some guilty-pleasure thriller on Netflix more than spending the afternoon preparing a five-course meal for your visiting relatives. And yes, you’re probably going to enjoy sitting around on the couch on Christmas overindulging in food, toys, and TV (or for adults: food, booze, and basketball) more than building the tiny model of the Eiffel Tower that you got in your stocking.
But you won’t be as satisfied.
Anyone who’s ever done anything requiring a modicum of will-power and ingenuity–even if only to solve a minor problem of their own making–knows that the accompanying frustration quickly gives way to a more lasting pride. Every deep breath you take all day will remind you of that jog. For weeks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment after making that meal. And while you might regret all of the pancakes and cocoa and movies and Christmas cookies well before December 26th, you will always be able to look at your model and think, with a smug sense of satisfaction, I did that.

Ah yes, another gummy purporting to have some vague healing properties. Sounds like the perfect starting point for a rousing round of…
THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE
Here’s how it works: we give you the claim the product makes, explain why we’re more than a little dubious, and then in the end, we come to some conclusion (if ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ can be considered a conclusion). Let’s get started!
The Claim
CBD is “a natural constituent of hemp” that “has been shown to have positive health benefits.” But since it contains no THC, it won’t get you high. Thus, it supposedly can help treat stuff like pain and anxiety with less risk of endless philosophizing or nachos.
The Skepticism
Here are pretty much all of the things we can definitively say about CBD:

It is short for cannabidiol.

Did we get all that? Does anyone need anything repeated? In the back? Can you all hear me?
Okay, that’s a simplification. There’s more. For example, we also know that, like Hansel, this CBD shit is just so hot right now. According to a New York Times article by Alex Williams, Willie Nelson is launching a line of CBD-infused coffee beans (two of his favorite things in one cup, he says), Mandy Moore is toying with it to see if it helps relieve the pain of walking in heels, and Glamour magazine ran a story with the headline “I Replaced My Entire Beauty Routine With Only CBD Products.” I am linking it here as proof. I refuse to actually read it, which I consider an act of self-care.
But what does it actually… do? Gabe Kennedy a twentysomething CBD start-up founder offers this:

Comparing it to the feeling after an intense meditation or yoga session, Mr. Kennedy added that the CBD glow has “synergistic downstream effects” in terms of social connections. “Around others, I find myself more present and attentive, more creative and open.”

To put my reaction in terms that Mr. Kennedy’s ilk would understand, I’d say the ROI on reading that paragraph was that I experienced an exciting disruption in the mouth sector, which, had I not cupped my hand over my lips, might just have gone viral all over my keyboard.
But while it’s fun to mock the eye-roll parade that the article provides, it also validates the claim made by Christie Aschwanden over at FiveThirtyEight: “the marketing has gotten way ahead of the science.”
Aschwanden is definitely more focused on the what than the why. Her article’s thesis is pretty well summed up by its headline: “Does CBD Really Do Anything?” There are definitely some serious WTF moments in here too. For example, when CBD-pedaling doctor Joe Cohen makes the claim that it has anti-cancer properties and might even help with Alzheimers, Aschwanden raises concern that these effects weren’t discussed in two of the most significant cannabis-focused reports out there. The good doctor’s reply: “I think you just have to Google search it.”
Moreover, though, she raises some important points, most notably that we don’t have mixed messages when it comes to CBD; we have almost no messages at all, because very few tests have looked at it on its own:

Animal models and a few human studies suggest that CBD can help with anxiety, but those are the only conditions with much research on CBD in isolation.

Otherwise, most studies focus on cannabinoids more generally, where they have actually found “‘conclusive or substantial evidence’ supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain in adults, multiple sclerosis-related spasticity (a kind of stiffness and muscle spasms), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”
Though, this assumes you’re getting a real dose, which also seems to be up in the air:

There are no guarantees that the label accurately reflects what’s in the product. For a 2015 study published in JAMA, researchers tested 75 products [cannabis] purchased in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle and found that only 17 percent were accurately labeled. More than half of the products contained significantly lower levels of cannabinoids than the label promised, and some of them contained only negligible amounts of the compounds.

The Conclusion
When we promise something here, we hold ourselves to it, so here comes: after reading about CBD, we can say, conclusively, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . But actually, it seems not to be super risky and to have some potentially great outcomes. So if you’re feeling anxious or a little achy, give it a try. Like most of this stuff, if you don’t think of it as a cure-all, you should be fine."	0.06			2018-11-02T04:00:05.893Z	0.42612956253890216	0.93	66292

It’s easy to come up with jokes about these things, and not just because they’re called “Lovesac Sactionals.” Like, imagine replacing all of a friend’s furniture with these one night, so they awake and believe they’ve grown. Or imagine a business man who uses them in his office as a power move, so that whenever someone comes to meet with him, they have to sit crouched to the ground feeling small.
But really, this hilarious world I’m describing, where everything is out of proportion is actually what young kids experience all the time, just inverted.
As @Superllama7 helpfully points out, “kids and pets can also use adult-sized furniture.” This is true, of course. Yet adult-sized furniture doesn’t really give kids a sense of ownership. Kids have toys and books. They have a bedroom they might share, and a bed to sleep in. But rarely are they given their own little space for quiet comfort in daytime, which is too bad, because it’s something they might like.
@2palms’s daughter did, at least: “with the double-wide seat she can get a leg up, then camp out in the corner with her books.” If that sounds super cute, I’ve got news for you: it is. @2palms includes two adorable pictures of “quiet morning reading time” on one of the 2 “chaise lounges” they put together. (@2palms elsewhere describes the Sactional furniture’s sturdiness, in case that’s a concern).

I, Clive Grunley, am not a mere athlete. Nor a biathlete. Nor a triathlete or anything so simple. No sir, I am a sexdecathlete, if you know what I mean!
What I mean is I compete in competitions comprising of sixteen distinct athletic feats. Why do you look so surprised? Did you think a sexdecathlete was something else?
A traditional sexdecathlon begins with a twenty mile run (1). Next, is a swim of at least 4 miles (2), but additional miles can be swum to earn tokens which can be used to hire additional bridge builders to help you build the bridge (3) back over the body of water you just swam across.
After that comes the javelin toss (4), followed by a short sprint (5), in order so that you can catch the same javelin you just tossed (6), and then, while holding it aloft, discuss with several gifted undergraduates how the javelin can serve, in literature, as a metaphor for one’s ascension and subsequent decline (7).
This is followed by a water break, which is not a break as in a moment of reprieve, but another event wherein each competitor builds a mold, pours water into it, freezes it, and then breaks the sculpture upon the shoulder of a competitor before they have one broken over theirs (8). Those who lose are disqualified, and given a strong handshake by those continuing on (9).
Next, you chop down a tree (10), then climb at least halfway up the tree (11), and carve some part of the three into a surfboard (12) while it is falling, so that you have something to ride when your tree eventually lands in the wave pool. You then ride a wave (13) to the artificial “shore” wherein a meeting ensues among remaining competitors as to how you might maintain the tree-related events while also promoting sustainability (14).
Which leaves nothing to do but cross the finish line (15) and exchange high fives (16). Yes, these count as events, as the finish line is a moat filled with poisonous snakes and we call them high fives because they must be completed atop a nearby mountain of you and your high-fiving partner’s choosing.
Anyway, the point being: after a long sexdecathlon, I’m beat. And I need at least three Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Packs to sooth my aches. I especially like that the texture provided by the ceramic beads allows for a nice massage. And let me tell you, us sexdecathletes might all be different, but every one of us likes a good rub!

If you’re shopping for yourself, you can get any food processor you want. You can take your parents’ old food processor. You can go to the thrift store, find one, search around for an outlet to make sure it spins, and take that one home. Or maybe you don’t need to go through all that trouble; maybe you just buy it as soon as you see it. If it doesn’t work, oh well! It was only a few bucks.
But if you’re getting someone a food processor as a gift, you need to do a little bit better than that. You don’t want to give your husband or wife or newly married friend something used that you’re pretty sure works. You need to give them something clean, something shiny, something new.
More than that: you need to give them a brand they’ve heard of. Because, come Christmas morning, you don’t want to have to lean over and say something like, “Chop Corp actually makes great food processors. You might not have heard of them, because they’re only sold in Kroger grocery stores in and around Columbus, Ohio. But they’re actually assembled from leftover Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach parts so that every model is functional and unique! And if you want, I watched a few youtube videos about replacing parts, so we could really ‘hack’ this thing, so to speak. Here, I have a screwdriver and soldering gun! Let’s do this!”
It’s much better to say, “It’s KitchenAid, so you know it’s good.”
If you want to say more, you can. For example, you could talk about how its drizzle basin allows for the easy incorporation of liquid ingredients. Or how it has two speeds and pulse so you can make anything from a chunky salsa to a smooth hummus. Or even how the work bowl, lid, and blade are all dishwasher safe.

Four truths and three lies about the artist Adam Koford:


Adam Koford, as a shirt designer often under the moniker of “Apelad”, has sold more than 260 designs on websites like Shirt.Woot, including several that this former Woot copywriter often still thinks of and laughs aloud.


Adam Koford’s art studio is in a house boat currently floating in international waters, the only place he can execute his diabolical pencil hold without being taken into police custody.


Adam Koford was, for a time, a jockey. He and his horse Maple Syrup were dominant, winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. On the track of the Belmont Stakes, though, disaster struck. Just feet from the finish line, Maple Syrup collapsed in a cloud of gray smoke, at which point it was discovered Maple Syrup was not a horse at all, but a robot powered, at its center, by a tiny car driving on a tiny treadmill.


Adam Koford is the creator of Laugh-Out-Loud Cats, a webcomic which can be viewed at HOBOTOPIA.com, as well as in a new book, One More For The Road, COMING SOON (stay tuned to Hobotopia for an official announcement in a couple weeks). A few months ago, he posted his 3000th Laugh-Out-Loud cats drawing. And since pictures are each worth a thousand words, that means Koford has produced the equivalent of 3 million words, the equivalent of somewhere between 30 and 50 novels. That’s impressive!


Adam Koford opens bananas by making several exacting surgical incisions with a scalpel. The peel-removal process can take up to two hours, but according to Koford, it’s worth it. “If you respect the fruit,” he says, “it will in turn respect you by unlocking heretofore hidden flavors.”


Adam Koford has worked as a senior writer and story artist on the video game versions of Bolt, Toy Story 3, and Cars 2. Which means he can say things like, “I wrote Toy Story 3,” and not technically be lying!


Adam Koford designed today’s shirt.

That kind of relief can feel almost euphoric, because it’s basically freedom. You don’t need to sample anymore. You don’t need to settle. That little operation in your brain that you’ve been forever running in the background, looking for that special something, can be discontinued, the energy rerouted.

Many considered A Portal Among The Pages, published in 1978, to be the book that marked science fiction author Hal Pembry’s ascension from merely great into the canon. His previous seven novels to that point had been entertaining and thought-provoking, but few managed to evoke the magic that Portal  seemed to achieve so easily. As one reviewer wrote, “When Finley [the book’s protagonist] first finds the Encyclopedia of Time, he does not know that it functions essentially as a time machine, yet he senses something special between the covers. Readers might find this sensation quite relatable, as they sit in their favorite chair, holding Pembry’s masterwork aloft.”
His fans were eager to see what he would come up with next. And they were profoundly disappointed when the answer turned out to be: nothing. Pembry never wrote another book. In fact, he disappeared altogether. Many assumed he’d gone the way of other successful literary eccentrics–that the fame had been too much for him and so he’d retired somewhere quiet for a life of seclusion. Others posited that the terrible film adaptation had driven him to flee out of embarrassment. A small faction of particularly conspiracy-minded fans put forward a theory of murder at the hands of Kyle Tolliver, a rival author driven mad by jealousy because his own stellar novel’s release had been eclipsed by Portal (this being a pun many newspapers made while discussing the books’ relative sales, as Tolliver’s concerned a deadly solar eclipse).
None of these theories came close to the truth. In actuality, Pembry’s novel was a confession of what was to come: he’d discovered a way in which he could, through literature, bend time. I know because he told me when I spotted him last week outside of a used bookstore in Omaha. He did not look a day older than his author photo from forty years ago.
I asked what he thought of life in our current age and he said, “It’s okay. There are many things that science fiction foresaw, only different in minor ways. There are robots that work for you, but the one’s that move have no personality, and the ones with personality don’t move. They live in speakers and phones. And then there’s that.”
He pointed to the GOTRAX Hoverfly ECO Hover Board I had ridden up on.
“I’ve read all about those. About how their electrical safety is certified, about how they can go nearly 8 miles per hour and up to 12 miles distance before needing a charge. It’s truly a work of ingenuity. Only, when I and many of my contemporaries had imagined hover-vehicles, I thought they would truly hover. Again, it’s not that I’m unimpressed. Sometimes, I wish there was just a bit more whimsy. At any rate, I ought to be going.”
I asked him where and he corrected me. “It’s when,” he said, then told me to name a year. 1919 was what came to mind, and he took out a small unmarked book from his blazer pocket, opened it to a specific page somewhere in the middle. “Ah,” he said. “Interesting.” He pointed to a line written on the page. I tried to lean over and see but in that moment, there came a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew, Pembry was gone."	0.05			2018-10-26T04:00:03.801Z	0.24495605686952773	0.93	63926

We all have our preferences when it comes to luggage. Some of us prefer the hard-sided rolling bag. We like that what we see is what we get, that its shape remains steadfast always. We find comfort in knowing that our things will be safe inside. Perhaps we go on a vacation and buy a commemorative glass; with our hard-sided luggage we can be sure that it will be safe, as long as you don’t pack it too loosely. You don’t have to worry about some other bag in the cargo crushing it.
Others of us prefer the duffel. It’s casual but also classic. It can go down the street to the gym, or across the world to Shanghai. If you don’t have much to pack, it’ll take up less space. You can pack lightly or overpack a little bit. Its soft sides are forgiving. Also: they’re malleable. Pack one full of clothes, and you can squeeze it almost anywhere. It’s like a firmer pillow.
And yet…
There are times when we wish our hard-sided luggage had just a little bit more give to fit in the tight space behind the passenger seat of a fully packed car. And there are times when we’d like trust our duffel to hold its shape just a little bit more. For example, when we travel to wine country in Oregon, we want to bring back a bottle of wine, not a bag full of wet wine-scented clothing and some decorative shards of glass.
In other words: when it comes to bag-style our preference is not as firm as we might think. And facing this knowledge, it quickly becomes clear that the options aren’t hard-sided or duffel. They’re:

We can refuse to choose. We can eschew bags altogether. We can wear all of the clothes we want to bring on a given trip, layered over each other. The top layer can be pair of cargo pants and a hoodie with a big pouch. In the pockets: our toiletries, our travel knickknacks, our phones, etc.

Or…

We can choose both. As in, we can buy one of each: a U.S. Polo hard-sided bag, and a U.S. Polo rolling duffel. If we’re going for ten days at the vase expo, we can bring the hard-sided luggage. If we’re driving across the country and want something that’s easy to roll in and out of motels every night, we can take the duffel. But with both, we always have what you need.

Okay, fine. This is manipulative. If you really want to buy just one or the other, that’s fine too… But know this: some day, you might regret that choice–some day, you might need those hard sides or that soft top–and when that day comes, we won’t be able to help you.

There’s a double-standard here. If you buy a shirt that’s slimming and shave every day because your facial hair comes in patchy or comb your hair a certain way that looks best with your face-shape, it wouldn’t be considered inauthentic. If anything, it’s the opposite. It shows an intelligence, an understanding of what you have and what works best. Because none of those things are harmful or uncomfortable or particularly time-consuming. They’re just simple steps you take to look your best.
On the other hand, if you try to slow the thinning of your hair–or at least slow the appearance of your hair thinning–that’s considered inauthentic. It’s mocked. Men are told that going bald is embarrassing, but also that covering up baldness is embarrassing. Because it exhibits some denial of reality, a fight against what nature has intended for you.
To which, we reply: Yeah, no shit! And there’s nothing wrong with that!
Maybe at some point, we can all wear ponchos, choosing between three or four each morning based solely on thickness of material. Those who are not going bald will stop cutting their hair, and those who are going bald will allow their hair to recede without ridicule. We will all stop showering, and we will all stop brushing our teeth, and we will cease complaining about the natural odors of our bodies and breath. And if some lose their teeth because theirs are weak, they will drink only nutritional juice of a greenish-brown color, and no one will judge them for it.
Until then, we just gotta do what we gotta do to look whatever way feels best. And if that’s using a hair fiber and locking spray, so be it.

“It’s not them either,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s certainly dolls and stuffed toys,” the exorcist proclaimed. “Raggedy Annes and Andys, sock monkeys, and teddy bears, all singing ironic songs of friendship while stalking your every move, each brandishing pencils sharpened into shivs.”
“Actually,” the toy seller said, “it’s fidget spinners.”
“Wait, what? Fidget spinners? Seriously?”
“I’m afraid it’s very serious,” the toy seller said. “They just won’t stop… spinning.”
“That’s it,” the exorcist said. “They’re just spinning? Like fidget spinners do? But on their own?”
“Exactly! And I have work to do! But I can’t anything done! Because I’m so distracted by their infernal noises! Some of them even glow!”
The exorcist nodded. “I understand. They glow brightly with the spirits of the dead.”
“Nope,” the toy seller said. “They’re just the LED kind. And they don’t all glow very brightly. They’re pretty hit-or-miss, to be honest. A lot of them are fine, but the lights on some are dim, or out entirely. That’s why we’re selling them for cheaper than the non-LED ones.”

The toy seller did not object. In fact, he hugged him and thanked him with tears and his eyes. The exorcist assured him it would all be okay.

Welcome to everyone’s favorite day: Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, wherein we offer a new shirt or whatever every Sunday until, eventually, we get lazy or forget and it ends! Today’s shirt requires a little more explanation than the others. Basically, it’s the Casemates launch shirt, on royal blue… BUT you get a choice: the original sketchy version of the logo (and that’s sketchy as in sketch-like; not like, “it can’t be trusted”) or a new exciting more geometric-looking logo!
That leaves you with four potential purchase choices:
You Purchase The Classic Design
This the option for people who respect tradition. You want a shirt you can wear each night when you return to your victorian home and settle into your bergère chair to re-read Don Quixote. What’s that playing in the background? Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16, of course. And what’s that you’re drinking? Maybe a glass of 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir, or maybe a Boulevardier cocktail that you’ve been antiquing for a few days in a mason jar in the fridge. It all goes just smashingly with your new (or should we say old?) Casemates shirt!
You Purchase The New Design
Here, we have the modern choice. You’ll look right at home wearing this when you pull your electric car into the driveway of your house, a recent construction comprised, it appears, of only the most jagged of edges. Inside, you’ll ask your digital assistant to play the latest release from your favorite musician, a masked individual from a country far away who makes electronic music that is one step removed from the dial-up modem noise. Then you’ll settle in to read a collection of experimental prose poetry while sitting on a piece of brutalist furniture that might be a couch but also might be an end table; you can’t remember. What you are sure of: how comfortable you feel in your exciting new Casemates shirt!
You Purchase Both
This one goes out to all those who toe the line between classic and modern. You like mid-century modern furniture. You listen to blue-grass covers of new wave songs and new wave covers of blue-grass songs. In short, you appreciate all things: from the old and traditional to the new and innovative. If we may be so bold: this is definitely the best choice.
You Purchase Neither
This choice, on the other hand… well, it’s not really a choice at all. It’s the absence of one. You’ve essentially chosen not to choose. To put it bluntly, you are empty. You see stories about rescue dogs on Facebook and feel nothing. you stand directly in front of the elevator doors waiting for them to open, not because you’re in a rush, not because you think you’re better than other people, but because you haven’t thought at all. Often, you feel as though you’ve forgotten something. Your phone? No. It’s in your pocket. Your wallet? No. That’s there too. Your keys? No again. Really, you have forgotten nothing; instead, what you’re experiencing is the sensation of your being crying out to fill the hole where a soul should be.
Anyway, hope this helps you make your decision! Happy Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, and until next time (if there is a next time)…"	0.07			2018-10-21T04:00:03.298Z	0.49400280593593765	0.94	54240

See, here’s what’s so annoying about this:
This is a drone. It does what drones do. It flies around for nine minutes, hovers in the air, etc. @Moose tested it. He said it actually was one of the easiest to fly, and might be the most stable of the ones he’s tried for our site. They could’ve marketed it for that: its ease and stability.
Or maybe they could’ve called it a photo drone or a video drone, because it does have a camera that can take 1.3MP pictures and 720p videos. After all, drones are often used for photos or videos. My pretty basic wedding package featured a video done with a drone. Remember that shot at the end of 10 Things I Hate About You, of the band playing on the top of building while the credits rolled? That shot probably required licensed pilots, a helicopter, crew members, waivers, the works. Now, anyone could make something that looks like that, for, I’d estimate, 5 figures less thanks to drones. Like this one.
And no: a Remake-The-Last-Shot-Of-10-Things-I-Hate-About-You-Or-Something-Like-It Drone isn’t exactly going to move units here in 2018… but it would probably be better than Selfie Drone.
Like, are you fucking serious? The phrase “selfie drone” is verbal ipecac. It takes ingenuity and renders it into an overcomplicated way for millennials to engage in the act that has become synonymous with the self-absorption most other generations (wrongly) know them for.
Still, what annoys me isn’t the how clear it is that this product was definitely named by some old dude thinking he’d discovered a new way to “reach the youth.” It had to be, by the way, because, say what you will about millennials, they at least know what a selfie is, and a photo that you need a drone’s angle to capture is not a selfie; it’s a photo with you in it. There’s a difference.
What annoys me is how reductive it is. It’s a dumb marketing 101. It thinks it’s carved out some entirely new lane in the drone game by catering to the selfie-obsessed among us, without taking into account the large number of people that it would turn off. Like, there are probably folks who arrived at the site today, read the product name, and said, “oh, no way,” and navigated away without reading another word. Or even if they did get further, they might still be thinking, It could be cool… but cool enough to risk my friends seeing a box that says “Selfie Drone” on it in the week before the recycling gets picked up? I don’t know…
That’s what really annoys me. But it doesn’t annoy me that much, to be honest. I mean, there’s a reason we can sell this thing here for $20. And it’s not because it’s a bad drone."	0.07			2018-10-20T04:00:46.966Z	0.34139579152096994	0.94	51885

Dear iRobot,
You’ve done what many companies aspire to do, but few actually achieve. In this stratosphere of success, your company is elite: Xerox, Kleenex, Ping Pong. Your product’s name–the Roomba–is now synonymous with (or maybe even supersedes) the “robot vacuum cleaner.” Congratulations.
And many of us here at Meh have been along for the ride since nearly day one. Yet, there’s something that’s frustrated us over the years: every time we sell a Roomba, we realize the model is slightly different than the previous one, despite looking almost exactly the same. We then dive into hours of research, hoping to solve the mystery of what’s so different in order to help our customers make an informed purchasing decision–only to find, in the end,  something trivial, like the canister capacity being one tenth of a percent larger than before.
What we’re saying here, iRobot, is: help us. Or, help us help you. Why not give every  new Roomba a feature that really STANDS OUT, so that they can be easily differentiated?
For example:


You could make one that says “sorry” whenever it bumps into a wall. An another that cries out in pain whenever it bumps into a wall. And another that recites a poem by Robert Frost in a Mike Tyson accent whenever it bumps into a wall.


Or a model that kisses your ankles when it goes by so that you know it loves you.


How about a Roomba that can take all the crumbs from the kitchen floor and forms them into new snacks for you to serve at your next party?


Maybe one Roomba could feature “pie warmth and texture.” And then the ""Plus ""version of that model could also feature “pie flavor.” And it could just be a pie.


Or what about a Roomba that just came with one completely functional human finger? Is that too much to ask?


Look, iRobot: the sensors, the 3-Stage Cleaning System, the ability to automatically adjust to any floor and navigate around furniture–that stuff is cool and all, but it’s also what we expect. Why not give people something a bit more unique? It would certainly be great for us. And if it’s great for us, isn’t it great for you too?
Just something to think about.
Sincerely,
Meh"	0.05			2018-10-19T04:00:01.945Z	0.2510909468726189	0.92	61001

Twelve-year-olds Arthur and Lisa, having split up to cover more of the town, reconvened at the tree house to compare their trick-or-treat bounties. They’d both dressed as zombies, but even through all the gory face paint, their disappointment was clear.
“Another lame Halloween,” Arthur said. “It’s like, what’s wrong with giving out candy? Everyone around here tries to get too creative. I got the worst stuff.”
“You got the worst? Wait until you see what I’ve got,” Lisa said.
They sat down and began removing items from their respective glowing Pop Lights bags.
“Look at this,” Arthur said. “Someone gave me one Triscuit!”
“If you want something to dip it in, I’ve got a bunch of ketchup packets here from an old lady,” Lisa said. “Hey, what’s that sloshing noise?”
“Loose soup,” Arthur said. “The guy just ladled it into my bag.”
Lisa leaned over and looked. “Are those malt balls floating in it?”
“Nope. Meatballs. It’s Italian wedding.”
“At least you can eat that,” Lisa said. “I don’t know what to do with these ticket stubs from a 1992 Celine Dion concert.”
Arthur put on a pair of eyeglasses. “Let me see them.”
Lisa handed the stubs over. “I didn’t know you wore glasses.”
“I don’t,” Arthur said. “Someone on Fourth was handing these out.”
“New?”
“Gently used,” Arthur said.
“Maybe I could use them to read this.” Lisa pulled out a stack of papers from her glowing Halloween bag. “Guy on twelfth was giving out copies of his unfinished novel. And I need to have critiques back to him in two weeks.”
“How is it?”
“It’s okay. There are some point of telling issues. Like, if you’re going to use a retrospective POV, the narrator can’t be surprised by the events as they unfold. Also, some of the fantastical elements frustrate me. I keep thinking: what are the rules of this world?”
“Huh,” Arthur said. “I wouldn’t be much help. I’m a journalist, not a novelist. Or at least I am now that a woman on Church Street gave me this.” He handed a diploma over to Lisa.
“Wow, a journalism degree! From George Washington University! They could be really useful,” Lisa said, “for mopping up the soup!”
“Hey, good idea,” Arthur said.
“I have no idea what to do with this.” Lisa held a sheet of paper.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“An NDA,” Lisa said.
“For what?”
“I can’t tell you.”
The two of them fell silent for a moment.
“You want one of these I Trick-or-Treated 2018 stickers?” Arthur offered.
Lisa took one. “Thanks. You want any of these Spirit Airline points I got over on Main?”
“Sure. How about some opportunities to build real wealth and passive income through direct marketing? Someone on Grand was handing those out.”
“Couldn’t hurt,” Lisa said.
“That’s it for me,” Arthur said. “And to think: I thought my parents were the lame ones for handing out some fidget spinners they bought online. What a bust!”
“Actually, maybe it wasn’t a total bust. A family on Breezy Lane did give me this.” Lisa took it out and set it down between them.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“I think it’s another, smaller, Halloween.” Lisa pointed at something swirling. “See, look.”

Probably, we should lie. We should say that this is practical. We should say something like: you can garden from inside! We should claim something about how, with the success of HBO’s Sharp Objects, wealthy families have a renewed interest in dollhouses, and some of them are even hiring full construction crews to break ground and build them; get the heavy duty equipment your crew needs to beat out the other bidders!
But we won’t. Instead, we’ll look both ways, we’ll lean forward, we’ll gesture for your to lean forward too, and then we’ll whisper into your ear…
We’re selling this so you can give it as a gift.
We’re cautious to admit this because you know how people get. The holiday season is filled with camaraderie, but few forms are as cathartic as uniting against its annual encroachment. They’ve got the decorations up and it’s not even December, you’ll say to a stranger in the coffee shop. Are they playing “Jingle Bells”? Before Thanksgiving? someone will say in the checkout line at the grocery store. You’ll shake your head when Santa’s village appears in the mall before the first significant snowfall, or when you see a flyer informing you that Black Friday sales somehow start on Tuesday this year.
And here we are, making our first offering of the gift-giving season weeks before Halloween! What gall, you think. What nerve. But friends: hear us out. By offering this R/C Excavator today, we’re not trying to get a jump on anyone… but ourselves.
Though we don’t always act like it, at the end of the day, we’re a store. The holiday season should be our time to shine. And yet, to really “kill it” during the holidays, you need to be sure of yourself. You need to be organized, to know when things will ship and how long they will take to get to where they’re going. You need to build a balanced approached; you can’t just sell a bunch of toys or a bunch of electronics or a bunch of socks. You need to offer all three at different times based on sales trends from previous years.

FLEECE BLANKETS!
I don’t know about where you all live, but here, the weather has taken a dark turn. It even snowed yesterday! Which means: it’s time to make a nice cup of tea or cocoa and bundle up under a fleece blanket on the couch with one to twelve dogs and/or cats for the next five months.
THE MATH
The four-pack will run you $14. That’s $3.50 per blanket. Not bad, right? But wait! The twenty-four pack goes for $60. That’s $2.50 per blanket. But wait even more! If the first four cost $14, that means the last twenty cost just $46, which is $2.30 per blanket! Does it make sense to break it down like that? Probably not! But that’s how we do it here on Order/Hoarder days!
WHAT TO DO WITH FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
With four fleece blankets, you can put one on the couch, one on recliner, keep one in the office, and still have a backup to rotate in when one is being washed. Or, store them all in a closet and break them out for a late fall bonfire.
WHAT TO DO WITH TWENTY-FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
So! Much! For example:


You could give them out as gifts to twenty-four of your favorite people!


Or, if you don’t have twenty-four favorite people, give them as gifts to twelve of your favorite people! (You can use the remaining twelve fleece blankets as wrapping paper for the other twelve fleece blankets!)


Send one to each venue on your favorite band’s 24-stop winter tour to show you’re a true fan!


Or, give one to all but four members of the twenty-eight piece Swedish indie pop group, I’m From Barcelona, in case they have to play any cold weather outdoor festivals! If they complain about not everyone getting a blanket, just tell them you’re not the idiot who decided to start a twenty-eight person band!


Use them to build a winter-ready tent in the bank yard! Actually, hell, you’ve got 24 fleece blankets! Build a winter-ready tent mansion!


Interior decorators will tell you that the right lighting can give rooms a soft, warm feeling; we say, why stop at lights? Why not take that “soft, warm feeling” over the top by wallpapering your house with fleece blankets?


See? Maybe twenty-four fleece blankets isn’t so impractical after all.

Let’s start off general and work our way into more specifics. Every laptop manufacturer calls their product something different, but a Chromebook isn’t just a cool name. It’s actually a different kind of computer. Laptop Magazine sums it up nicely:

Instead of Windows 10 or macOS, Chromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. These machines are designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with most applications and documents living in the cloud.

In other words, if you live in a cabin somewhere in the mountains, and you have to hike and ski many miles back to civilization to grab a solitary bar of wi-fi, this might not be your best bet. Nor would it be a good option if you’re looking for a machine that can support your career cutting movie trailers and playing the latest computer games. These things are pretty sparse, in terms of power.
But for the rest of us, who pretty much never stray far from the router and who mostly use our computers for checking email, keeping track of things, writing, and organizing: a Chromebook is actually a pretty great, pretty cheap option.
And this one is actually both of those things: we’re selling it for just under $150, and on Amazon it has four stars on over 1,000 reviews.
Yes, if you want to be cynical, you could say: but wait, Meh, this thing came back out who-knows-when, and many of those reviews were written a while ago. And that’s true. BUT 1) there were still five star reviews coming in as recently as August of 2018; and 2) never underestimate the online reviewer. Like, these people self-identify as arbiters of all that is good (and not good) to buy; do you really think they wouldn’t rush to update their review the minute anything goes wrong?
Besides, let’s be totally honest: as much as we like to talk about the forward march of tech, most of us are still using our computers for the exact same things as we did five years ago. New apps come and go, but we’ll always need to make spreadsheets and type up documents and check our email.

Mr. Khool was the coolest teacher at Meh High. He taught an elective called The Mathematics of Skating, a class he only managed to get approved after bringing the principal to a skate park and catching phat air while explaining how each side of a halfpipe was essentially a graph of exponential growth. Now, he was on his way to teach his first session of it when, rounding a corner, he heard stifled sobs.
Narf, hunched next to the water fountain, tried to straighten up when he saw Mr. Khool approaching. “Oh, hey, Mr. Khool. I was just… uh… making sure the fountains weren’t leaking.”
“Sounds like the only thing leaking are your eyes, l’il guy,” said Mr. Khool, crouching next to him. “You want to talk about it?”

“I know what you’re going through,” Mr. Khool said.
“You do?”
“Sure! Being a cool guy is great, but sometimes it’s hard to get people to take me seriously. They think it’s all kick flips and cliff jumps, when really that’s only like 60 to 70 percent of what I do. There’s also a lot of hard work that nobody gives me credit for. But you know what? Whenever I start to feel like maybe it’s time to trade my longboard in for a Prius, I remind myself: there’s a reason progress and persistence both start with p. A friend of mine told me that once. His name was Tony Hawke.”
Narf’s eyes went wide. “Tony Hawk the skateboarder?”
“No,” Mr. Khool said. “This is Hawke with an e. He was Ethan Hawke’s second cousin. We played in a band together in college. And actually he went by Anthony.”
“So do you just call him Tony Hawke so people think you’re talking about Tony Hawk?”
“It doesn’t matter why I do it,” Mr. Khool said. “The point is, it’s a decision I made to call him Tony. And we all have decisions to make in this life. So, are you going to give up, or are you going to decide to keep chasing your dreams?”
Narf stood up. “You’re right! It doesn’t matter that it’s taken this long! I can’t give up now, not for anything!”
“That’s right! So, what is it that you’ve been asking for?”
“A cat shirt,” Narf said.
“Wait, seriously?” Mr. Khool said, getting to his feet. “But you’re Narf. You’re wearing a cat shirt right now. And you wore one yesterday. And the day before that. And actually every other day too. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the same cat shirt twice, now that I think about it.”
Narf slung his backpack over his shoulder. “Sorry, Mr. Khool. I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve gotta get to chem. Thanks again! You really said exactly what I needed to hear!”
“That’s great,” Mr. Khool said. “Although, maybe we need some other designs?”
But Narf was already off and running to his next class.

Douglas, We’re glad you’re here. We can see you’re confused, but don’t worry: all will be explained. You see, when LeAnn said to come home so you two could “take a scenic flight over a pristine lake” together, she was lying. This is an intervention. We, your friends and family–we’re all worried about you, Douglas.
It all began when you bought that Odyssey Stellar NX Drone. You said it was a way to bond with your son. But you didn’t let Trevor use it much, did you, Douglas? Still, it was a fun hobby for you. You liked that it came with a VR headset, so you could see from the drone’s POV. You would fly it, recharge it, fly it, recharge it, all day.
Only after a few months did we start to see the warning signs. You walked into furniture, cursing your legs. You started standing on the dining table to watch television. You called this “a more natural prospective.”
Then there was the mini drone that came with your purchase of the original drone. You started calling it ‘l’il guy,’ then ‘son,’ then finally you named it. It would’ve seemed cute, if you didn’t choose, ‘Trevor,’ the same name as your real son.
Yes, Douglas, that’s right: only one of them is your real son. Because you are not a drone, Douglas! You are a man! You might spend days coming out of drone-prospective for only as long as it takes your Odyssey to charge. You might spend these times with your eyes closed tight, whispering, “it’s a dream, it’s just a dream,” so as not to face the fact that you are a human being, and as such, you are bound by gravity to remain on the ground.
But it’s not healthy, Douglas! You have a family! You have a job! You have obligations! You can’t just ignore them because you have “a new life in the sky” now. It can be a fun hobby, but you’ll never really be a drone, Douglas. You need to start seeing that. And moreover, you need to apologize to all of us for what you’ve put us through. Let’s start with Trevor.

User @alacrity wants one thing and one thing only: a margarita.
When we sold a Copper Cookware set, they wrote:

well, I guess I could serve margaritas in these…

On a two-pack of posture trainers:

it has to be said: these make really shitty margaritas.

For a 2-pack of cast aluminum skillets:

well, I guess I could drink a margarita out of em… but there’s still the salted rim thing.

A coffee maker:

this will make very hot margaritas.

Earrings:

these are absolutely useless for margaritas.

You might notice that these are not all sales from the last few months. No, @alacrity has lived with desire for years. But that will change today. Because today we are selling a Cuisinart Waring Pro Blade Blender.
And yet the story does not end here. What we want to know is: how does @alacrity feel about this?
Will they arrive at the site today relieved? Will they cry aloud, “For many years I have wished for nothing more than a sweet lime-rich tequila cocktail. And at long last, the great Meh has delivered to me a device that shall itself deliver me to my own personal paradise. Thank you, Meh! Thank you so much!”?
Or will they feel some resentment? Will they realize, all too late, that the real margarita was the friends they made along the way? Or, to put it differently: is there any margarita that’s as sweet on the lips as camaraderie is to the heart?
And yet, there remains a fact we have not reconciled: uhh, like, hello? We’ve sold blenders before!
So perhaps we’re misreading @alacrity. Perhaps, they do not hope for their own margaritas at all. Perhaps they seek only to be a sort of margarita-specific town-crier, to stand in the virtual park at the center of Meh and warn all those around them about the dangers of attempting margaritas in products not optimized for margaritas.
And then of course, there is the final possibility: maybe @alacrity prefers margaritas on the rocks.
So what is it? Only time will tell. And by time, we mean: hopefully @alacrity in the forums."	0.05			2018-10-12T04:00:20.860Z	0.34750686103289724	0.94	59130

Watches? I never wear watches. Why would I wear a watch in the age of cellphones? That’s what I say. Because I believe in efficiency. It guides my every waking move, from the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the time I lay down to sleep at night. (That’s the alarm on my phone, by the way. Why have an alarm clock when you have a cell phone?)
But it’s one thing to say you believe in efficiency, and it’s a whole other thing to live by it. I know because I do. To prove it, I’ll run through my average morning:
First thing’s first, I make breakfast. It’s the same every day: spaghetti and meatballs. I have it for lunch too. And dinner. Food is food, isn’t it? Why should I have different foods for different meals?
When I’m done eating, I floss and brush my teeth, then spit into the drain in my shower. Because why have a sink when you have a shower? Is not a shower a human-height sink? Think about that for a second. Anyway, when I’m done brushing my teeth, I wash my hands with shampoo. Soap-products are soap-products, after all! Then I shave, checking my reflection in the mirror–by which I mean, my phone, on selfie mode.
A little bit of leisure time is part of being efficient too. So, before heading out the door to work, I take twenty minutes to relax. I might watch a show (on my phone) or read a book (on my phone). But soon enough it’s time to check the weather (on my phone). To confirm the app, I look out the window–the single window I have in my whole house. Why do I need to see out my house from so many different sides? Outside is outside, no matter what way you’re looking at it. One window is plenty.
Using this information, I decide what I’m going to wear: pants or shorts. I should elaborate; it’s the one garment, but it’s got a zipper so I can unzip them at the knee when it gets warm. It’s the same pair I wear every day, because again, for me it’s all about efficiency. Not everyone is a fan of this. My sister, for example, once said she actually hated my zip-on pant-shorts. She said I should switch things up by wearing something else sometimes. She said that by wearing them I was ruining her wedding. Can you believe that?
She hasn’t spoken to me since then, but I don’t mind. I still have another sister, and honestly, at the time, I was in the middle of a painful decision of which sister I would keep. Two sisters? Are you crazy? Who needs all that in your life?
Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh, right: these watches. Yep, don’t need them. Although, they would go nicely with the one sweatshirt always I wear, especially on days when it’s hot enough that I have to roll up the sleeves. And if you’re wondering why I don’t just take it off, it’s simple: I’m not wearing anything underneath. Wearing a shirt under what is essentially another shirt?

Imagine for a moment you’re a secret agent. You’ve been called upon to infiltrate a very important party held by a tycoon with designs to take over the world. You need to take a video of the party, so key attendees can be identified, and hopefully sneak into the study where you’re told the plans for the doomsday device are kept. For this mission, you’ll be provided with a PogoCam. It’s smaller than a tube of lip balm, attaches magnetically to your favorite pair of glasses, and shoots 5 megapixel photos and 720p HD videos. You just need to go to Q to collect it.
FYI: in this imagined scenario, Q refers to the dumpster behind the Qwikmart convenience store down the block, not the genius gadgeteer from the movies. Because, boy oh boy, would that guy steer clear of this thing.
In fact, over on Amazon the PogoCam only has 2.5 stars. That’s some real ruh-roh territory, especially given most products fall into a 3 star rating just by being delivered. People who bought it without the Pogotrack sunglasses offered here griped about the safety loop required when using your own pair.  Others complain about the picture quality or that it only takes 30-second video clips.  One user goes even further: “while I have little proof,” LE says, “[I] believe PogoCam has been the cause of much of the world’s turmoil lately.”
Not great!
But here’s the thing: since it’s come out and been revealed to be of less than desirable quality, the PogoCam’s price has tanked. In fact, I’m told that at one point is retailed for as high as $150. That’s nuts. But even with all those price drops, it’s still just shy of 50 on the 'zon.
We’re selling it for $24. For that price, it can just be a fun little gimmicky impulse buy. Wear it once or twice and you’ve pretty much justified the purchase. If you get it to work better than a bunch of Amazon reviewers and find some real use for it, awesome! If not, at least you got some sweet magnetic sunglasses out of the deal.

There were only two of them in the conference room, but when the engineer placed the SmartStand prototype on the table, his hands still shook with anxiety, as if he were making a presentation to the entire company. In a way, he was. Across the table sat the founder and CEO.
“Looks simple.”
“Just as you asked, sir,” the engineer said.
“So let’s talk features,” said the CEO. “It can hold your tablet or phone while you’re cooking, so that the recipe is easy to read?”
“Yes, sir,” said the engineer.
“And it tracks the ingredients used, placing orders based on what’s running low in your cabinet and refrigerator?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it intuit how romantic a given meal seems, and adjust the room’s lighting accordingly?”
“No, sir.”
“Does it feature an olfactory sensor that reads the smell of the meal and gives spicing advice?”
“No, sir.”
“Let’s talk about travel use: on an airplane, it can hold up your phone or tablet making it easier to watch a show or movie?”
“Yes, sir.”
“And it can place drink orders with the flight attendant, based upon the mood of said show or movie?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it message the gate attendants of your connecting flight, informing them when delays get in the way of your lunch or dinner plans, so they know to have a torta from Frontera waiting for you?”
“No, sir.”
“Tell me that it can at least read the forecast for your destination and place orders for weather-appropriate pants.”
“It can’t, sir.”
The CEO stared for a long time at the prototype. “So, it’s not ‘smart’ at all?”
“Well, sir,” the engineer said, “I like to think of it like this: by adding a number of attention-grabbing but ultimately unnecessary and overcomplicated ‘smart’ features, we’d only introduce the possibility for bugs and glitches. Not to mention we would have to put out different models for different phones and tablets. So, despite how it may seem, this is a ‘smart’ product, in that simplicity is smart, because it leads to ease of use and universal compatibility.”
The CEO pounded his fist on the table. “I like that! I like that a lot! Not smart is actually smart! That’s great! That’s gonna help me a lot, not just at work, but also in my personal life!”
“Actually, sir, what I said was simplicity is–”

We’re entering the time of year when everything freezes and dies and allergies are replaced by a sense of tired dryness. For some of you, this might be a relief. And yet, consider these two things: first, said dryness does nothing to dry up non-seasonal allergies, like those related to pets; and second, spring will be back sooner than you think with its pollen-thick air. And just like the smart shopper buys next year’s wrapping paper the day after Christmas when it’s marked down to nothing, so too does he or she purchase an allergen-optimized vacuum just as allergy season winds down.
And boy oh boy, does this thing suck up allergies. In fact, it “captures and traps 99.9% of dust and allergens down to 1 micron.” As a non-allergy-sufferer myself, I don’t know exactly what that means. I can tell you that, given the the word “micron” is pretty much just “micro” with an n, it sounds pretty small.
What I actually CANNOT understand is what the fuck “MultiFLEX Technology” is. I know that it “provides flexible reach for under furniture and freestanding, compact storage.” But what does that mean, exactly? Digging a little deeper, I found that the “MultiFLEX wand bends so you don’t have to, reaching under low lying furniture with ease.” So, apparently, it’s a kind of semi-flexible wand? That’s it? Seriously?

Yes, on one level, the design is simple: it’s the Meh face, or should we say, the many (meh-ny) Meh faces you see when you come to our site. It’s a button. You press it. You keep a streak going, if you want. Or else you don’t; you reserve the Meh button only to show your nonplussedness. It’s something that makes our site special, a little inside joke among you, the customer, and us.
But, on another level, the design means so much more. It’s a tribute. To us. And all we’ve done for the world of commerce. Before we came along, all was excitement, and much of it was false. Companies didn’t know that it was fine enough to be, well, fine enough. Everything had to be glorious and exuberant. But then we showed up, and we taught people that it doesn’t always have to be that way. You don’t have to worry about moving the proverbial needle. You don’t need to dial it up to a ten. You can hang out at a five if you want.

Now, most modern phones can be fully charged with between 2000 and 3000 mAh, which means even the smallest power bank we’re offering can charge your phone somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times. By that standard, you could get 2.5 to 3 full charges with a 6000 mAh power bank, and 4.5 to 5 with the 9,000.
But look, we’re not going to spend the next few hundred words talking math. It’s too abstract. The most helpful thing to do would be to provide brief profiles for who might require each power capacity, so that you identify yourself among them. Here goes:
4,200 mAh
Last time you went camping, your phone spent the entire night searching for a network it would never find. You woke up and had no juice, and while it turned out okay, you don’t want to risk it again. You need something that’ll charge your phone in case of an emergency, but you don’t need much more than that. Bonus point: you can bring it with you to work, because you work out of a truck that, strangely, has neither a USB port nor a cigarette lighter.
6000 mAh
One morning, you wake up and find a strange man standing over your bed. He explains: he’s a representative to the Corrigan Cartel, one of the most notorious crime families in Ohio. Recently, your little brother got in with them, except he didn’t make good on his promises. Now, they’re holding him somewhere, and the only thing between him and a pair of cement shoes is you. You’ve got a full day ahead of you, enacting archaic rituals and making shady transactions in a number of parks in and around Cincinnati. And let’s just say the Corrigans didn’t factor in any time for you to stop and juice up your phone. Which is a problem, because you need to be face-timing the entire time so they can be sure you don’t call the cops. In short: you’re gonna need some serious recharge power.
9000 mAh
You get a text from an unknown sender, a wrong number, you think. Or maybe it’s spam. It’s a tip on a hot new cryptocurrency. The text says it will change your life. Sure, you think with a chuckle. But you can’t help but be a little intrigued. So you follow the link to an app, and you start mining. You leave it going overnight. The next day, you wake up feeling significantly taller and stronger. You look at yourself in the mirror. Its as if you’ve been Photoshopped into a model. You find that you have an intense desire to work out. You go running and clock 18 miles easily. The next day you go further. And further after that. Soon you’re running up mountains just to get your heart rate going. You’ve made partner at the firm, which is crazy because you don’t remember becoming a lawyer. The paychecks are amazing. You’re constantly out hiking, skydiving, rock climbing, and cliff jumping. And all the while, you’ve got your phone with you, mining, draining your battery. You don’t want it to stop. You’re afraid that if it does, this will all come crashing down. And yet, you’re always setting off on some new adventure. You don’t get a chance to charge that often. You need a power bank, something with some serious mAh, in order to maintain this new reality.

Here’s the thing: if a smartphone, smartwatch, powerbank and a bunch of other things for just $99 sounds too good to be true… well, it is, sort of. Don’t get us wrong: this phone, like, works. It’s actually not that bad. But if you keep up-to-date with your upgrades and always choose the newest Samsung or Apple offering, you might be a bit less than wowed by this thing.
Then again, this sale isn’t for you. Really, it’s an intervention for the still-using-a-flip-phone crowd.
Look, it was cute for a while. You met up with your friends and a few of their friends, and they became your friends too, and at some point you took out your phone to exchange numbers, and everyone was like, “Wow! You still use that thing?” And maybe they laughed. Or maybe they were impressed, because you’d somehow managed to avoid the magnetic pull of digital progress.
But that was in 2013. Now, it’s 2018 and those same friends are texting you stuff like, “He proposed! I said YES!!!” or “It’s a healthy baby girl, 7 lbs, 12 ounces!” And you’re responding, “k,” because even typing out a simple “congrats” would take about twenty minutes. And you don’t have that kind of time. Because you’re at a red light. And you’ve gotta look down at the directions you printed out from MapQuest.
By which we mean: buddy, this shit ain’t cute anymore.

You don’t want to be addicted to the endless flow of information, to be rendered just another mindless zombie, walking into streetlights because you’re too engrossed in a stream of moth memes. You want to really experience the world, you say. And we get that. Except, pal: you’re on Meh right now, and you’ve read almost the entire write-up. So let’s tap the brakes before we judge how everyone else is using their time.
And don’t worry: this phone is not nice enough to make you seem suddenly materialistic.

Each year, representatives from all 50 European countries gather for the EuroSock Summit to discuss potential changes to the sock’s age-old design. Here is a summary of year’s Summit, which took place in Luxembourg in a chamber deep inside the Grand Ducal Palace:


The representative from Sweden proposed changing the design, so that the sock appeared strangely both modern yet antiquated, like a torture device, but also attractive and entirely comfortable. Motion failed to pass by a vote of 11 to 39.


The representative from Italy proposed making the next EuroSock as soft as the richest pillowy ball of burrata, as delicate to touch as the most sumptuous pluck-able leaves of basil, and yet as firm as tagliatelle cooked to a perfect al dente. Also: more garlic. Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 19 to 31.


The representative from France proposed making the sock from a distinct material that would grow delightfully crusty over night, so to it could be enjoyed the next day. There was some confusion over this, but eventually the representative from France admitted she was simply hungry, having been disappointed in her hotel’s bread options that morning at breakfast. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Norway proposed making the sock seven times thicker. When someone suggested he have multiple pairs of socks–some for summer, others for winter–he smiled and nodded, saying, “Yes, exactly! These would be for summer!” Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 3 to 47.


The representative from Ireland proposed making the socks out of a darker fabric, one “as pitch black as a Guinness.” The representative from Belgium chimed in to add that the fabric should be strong, “not unlike a delicious quadrupel.” The German representative also leaned forward to propose adding a pinch of sea salt, “one of the key ingredients in a traditional gose.” When they all three broke down laughing it became clear that they’d partaken in a few of the aforementioned beverages during the break for lunch. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Lithuania proposed shelving sock-talk for a bit. Instead, she suggested, maybe they should open some rakia, grappa, limoncello, champagne, or what have you and join their Irish, Belgian, and German compatriots, who were obviously having the best time of anybody. Motion passed by a vote of 50-0.


In this way the Summit ended, just as in previous years, and the EuroSock remained mostly unchanged."	0.05			2018-10-04T04:00:09.459Z	0.30652535328345804	0.94	60866

When I first saw that we were selling an air fryer, I was torn.
On the one hand, Wirecutter pretty emphatically stated that they don’t recommend these things for how expensive they are. If you’re not familiar with Wirecutter, they’re basically one of the best and most straightforward resources for when you’re buying kitchen appliances, electronics, and just about everything in between. They do a lot of research and provide simple, easy-to-understand articles replete with concrete purchasing recommendations. So, their opinion carries a lot of weight.
On the other hand, my dad has an air fryer and he likes it.
Two venerable sources. Two contradictory opinions. I didn’t know who to trust. So I began to dig deeper. Here’s what I found:


While working on his Wirecutter article, Michael Sullivan conducted more than 35 hours worth of air fryer tests. In the end, he was so unimpressed with them that he recommended buying a simple convection toaster oven to get a better bang for your buck.


Back when I was in high school, my dad used to change my car’s oil. Not just check it, mind you, but perform a full-blown change. He had a little pit in the garage, so you could pull your car right in and he’d take care of it every 3000 miles.


Given those two facts, I came to the following conclusion: it was possible that my dad had also used his air fryer for 35 total hours, yet it was very unlikely that Michael Sullivan had ever changed the oil in my car when I was in high school. This seemed like a pretty clear “checkmate” situation. But then I remembered that an air fryer’s greatest selling point is its oil-free frying. Thus, it only seemed fair that all oil-based arguments need be discarded. I found myself right back at square one.
Then it hit me: my dad is a Meh customer. He likely bought his air fryer right here on this very site. Meanwhile, Wirecutter suggests a model that retails at about $250, which is FIVE TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS ONE. Furthermore, they never say they’re outright bad; they just say they aren’t worth the money. Which makes sense: my dad would likely not be the satisfied air-frying customer he is today had he been required to fork over more than 200 bucks.
Therefore, Wirecutter, I know we’ve suggested this before, but if you’re reading this, consider an addendum to your initial verdict of “Not recommended”: something like, “unless it’s selling on Meh for almost a fifth of the cost, in which case, go to town.” I’d be happy to put you in touch with my dad if you need any more information."	0.05			2018-10-03T04:00:13.622Z	0.4058992852291472	0.92	65054		0.15524434813545068

In the grand scheme of things, I’m pretty smart about health stuff. No, not necessarily among other humans. I mean in the REAL grand scheme, as in: among all living creatures in the world. I sometimes eat too many donuts, or drink so much coffee that I give myself a headache. But I at least KNOW what I’ve done immediately after I’ve done it. And compared to my cats or my dog, I come out looking like a friggin’ genius!
For example, I won’t find my way into the trash and attempt to consume a giant wad of paper towels that were used to soak up frying oil, only to slink behind the couch and embarrassedly vomit it up. And if I found myself stuck in a bathroom, I would wait patiently until someone got home and ask them for some help. I would not, under any circumstances, try to EAT MY WAY OUT, causing enough damage so that both the door and the trim need to be replaced, and giving myself a pretty rough tummy ache along the way. Another point in my favor: I understand the utility of pills as well as the ease with which they can be taken. They don’t need to be hidden in cheese or loaded into a little plastic contraption to be shot deep into my throat in order to induce swallowing. I just take them!
And yet, even as I type these gloating words, I’m sitting in a rickety wooden chair, leaning awkwardly over my laptop. Unlike the damage of a few too many donuts or a bit too much coffee, I won’t feel the effects of my bad poor posture for many years. And yet, I know this, but I do nothing to correct it.
In a way, poor posture is like the human version of eating out of the garbage. We just can’t help it. Instead of taste-testing rotten meat or chewing on plastic bags, we hunch. And just as pets need help learning what they should and should not do, often for their own good, so do we.
That’s where this this Posture PT Confidence Corrector comes in. It can fit onto just about any chair–from office chairs to the driver’s seat of your car–and it improves posture, which in turn strengthens your core and reduces lower back and shoulder pain. Or, to put it differently, it’s not unlike a spray that makes bad posture smell like sour apples!
Okay, that’s going a little overboard with the pet metaphor thing. It’s not a spray. It’s a posture corrector. Sorry for the confusion. Now buy one, and straighten out your life. Got it?"	0.05			2018-10-02T04:00:03.835Z	0.31486252125742953	0.93	62431

Today’s sale leaves us conflicted. On the one hand, this would seem like an Order/Hoarder sale: you’re given options, some more reasonable than others. On the other, it’s not exactly the same as past Order/Hoarder sales we’ve offered. For example, there are more than two options. So, if you don’t mind, we thought we could work through this together, with a little Q&A:
How does the math break down?
This is a little more complicated than usual. You can get a 40 pack of basic fidget spinners for $14 ($0.35/spinner) or a 40 pack of LED fidget spinners for $16 ($0.40/spinner). But you could also get a 160 pack of both LED and basic fidget spinners (an 80 and 80 split) for $34. Which is about $0.21 per spinner… except, if you think about it: the first 40 basic spinners cost $14 and the first 40 LED spinners cost $16, which adds up to $30. So that’s a mere $4 for the last 80 fidget spinners, or a nickel per! CRAZY!
So then why wouldn’t this be an Order/Hoarder sale?
For three reasons:


As mentioned above, it’s not an either/or. There are three options.


40 fidget spinners will already have you well on your way to hoarding fidget spinners; but, more importantly…


These aren’t really for hoarding! We’re offering them now, because we want  to get them to you with plenty of time to spare before the end of the month. That way, you can offer them out to Trick Or Treaters on Halloween. That doesn’t sound very hoarderly at all, does it?


Why wouldn’t you just give candy away on Halloween like everyone else?
Because fidget spinners are fun and will last longer. Also, this site is run by someone from Saint Louis where some people give out jokes instead of chocolate, so it’s kind of on brand for us to eschew the national standard for Halloween practices.
Wait, back up: what even ARE fidget spinners?
They’re goofy little spinny toys with no real purpose other then to be fidgeted with.
That’s sorta dumb, isn’t it?
You might think so, but in a world where people try to sell peppermint-scented oil as an alternative to physical therapy, I find it refreshing that there’s a product out there that’s explicitly for useless goofings-off.

First, this is some pretty classy jerky. Therefore, the price tag isn’t going to be exactly in line with the Slim Jim that you buy on a whim as you check out at the grocery store, only to open it in your car and for the noxious smell to make you regret your decision, although not enough to stop you from eating it. Hypothetically speaking. Point is: this is good jerky and good jerky costs money.
Second, and more importantly: we need to make something EXCEEDINGLY clear. We saw @djslack’s suggestion and considered it, but the decision to sell the jerky ultimately came down to us and us alone. In fact, there’s a chance that we subconsciously were thinking about selling jerky and so @djslack didn’t exactly give us the idea as much as surface it.
What we’re saying is: we’re not necessarily in the business of outsourcing our product selection. As in, we don’t do requests. As in, don’t get used to this, okay? Because this is it. The party ends here.
We say this because ever since we sold some toothbrushes as a joke–that’s right, it was a joke! A joke ON YOU!–we know there have been rumblings on the forums about something you’d like us to sell. That’s how obstinate we are, people: we won’t even name the item. We won’t even write the word. Because we are unmovable.
We’re like a brick wall. People always tell us that. They say, “Talking to you all is like talking to a brick wall.” Which we take as a compliment concerning our strength. And also our attractiveness, given that brick is a very beautiful building material. In certain cases, at least. Maybe not in some of the suburban architecture of the mid-fifties. But then again, those homes have a certain nostalgic beauty in a way. There’s a pure American warmth to them, isn’t there?

Thus, in order to know what the site is, all you’ll need to do is follow a wide variety of publications that cover the following: computers, electronics, kitchen appliances, vacuums, cameras, photography, automotive innovations, home and garden, just home, just garden, cellular accessories, flashlights, salt lamps, culinary interests, pillows, snacks, fashion, lawn maintenance, DIY home improvement, carpentry, wiring, construction, cameras again, etc. That way, you’ll see our press release announcing our new venture. As well as new hires.
Because we would essentially need to build an entirely new team, wouldn’t we? Otherwise, it’d just be a gimmick. And besides, I don’t want a flashlight expert telling me about trowels or copper pans or robot vacuum cleaners. No, we’d have to start from scratch every day. And in the event that something sells out, we’d probably have to have another site. A site of nothing. A sort of meditative anti-consumerism zen space with no purpose aside the absence of all shopping. Which would also need a whole new staff. That would need to be hired midday and let go by the next morning…
Okay, you know what, we’re going to take these thoughts back to the idea room and think this through a bit further. In the meantime, what you can do to help is buy some flashlights!"	0.05			2018-09-28T04:00:10.030Z	0.31179265788250815	0.94	69975

Dearest Professor Alba,
First off, a hearty congratulations on winning the Henning Prize. Your self-adhering bow-tie is certainly a masterwork, and the award is absolutely deserved. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the ceremony. As I am sure you are aware, since my expulsion, you are my sole correspondent from the Meyer Institute of Alchemic Fashion. But my choice not to attend is not due to some fear of seeing my former classmates and teachers again–or, more accurately, of experiencing their fear as they witness me. No, I cannot attend because I have fallen ill, and I fear this may be the last letter I ever write.
Although, perhaps ‘fallen ill’ is a simplification, as the illness under which I suffer has no name.
The trouble began in my makeshift lab late one night. I was working on a new stitch technique, making minor tweaks to it here and there over the course of several weeks. It was going nowhere, and after one particularly long day toiling in the haberdashery (with no Meyer Certification, I am forced to do such menial labor), I came home so exhausted and angry that I decided to throw it all away in favor of something entirely new.
I am sure you will be disappointed to hear this. During my expulsion hearings, you were the strongest voice in my favor. When the administration said that I “endangered” all those around me with the “diabolical recklessness” of my work, you told them it was just a phase. But Professor Alba, it was not. And while I am not proud to admit that, I am also not exactly not proud either.
For that evening, in my lab, I created something amazing: a stitch unlike any other stitch; a stitch that seemed to take time into it, that seemed to steal tiny slivers of the universe’s fabric and convert them into pure style. It was a stitch that resembled a stitch in only an ethereal way, like a word in another language whose definition we can on some level understand but for which there is no direct translation. I sewed up some pairs of socks with the stitch; despite using bland monochrome fabrics, each pair came out patterned with a bold unpredictable design.
I learned all too late that it was taking something from me as well, that it was essentially draining my life energy, weaving it among each sock’s seams. I fashioned a lead coat to wear while working, but it was too late. The damage has been done. I write this letter to you from bed, Professor Alba, a bed from which I fear I may never again rise. Indeed, just the act of writing has left me pale and exhausted.
But this is not a letter merely bidding farewell to you and this world. You will find, in the envelope, the detailed plans for the aforementioned stitch (as well as for the protective coat). I cannot say what I want for you to do with them. Some days I hope you will set them aflame and think of them no more; other days I hope you will use them to start a line of vibrant and delightful socks to sell around the world.
But, Professor Alba, promise me this: if you choose the latter, make sure to warn the people, to let them know the truth, that these are not simply stitched socks.
With Eternal Gratitude,

Step 2: Apply ass to chair. (Optional, recline chair or use ottoman to extend legs).
Step 3: Apply blanket to lap and/or legs.
Step 4: Apply purring cat to blanket at lap area. Pet cat occasionally.
Step 5: Apply hand to remote; locate a binge-worthy show on your television; press play.
Step 6: When your significant other or roommate enters the room and asks if you’re really going to spend all day just sitting there watching television, sigh and say, “You’re right,” then move (very slightly) to get up, stopping only to hiss with pain and grasp at the injury area where the first aid was administered. (Optional: parlay sympathy, if shown, into your significant other or roommate bringing you a hot beverage of your choice: coffee, tea, cocoa, or apple cider.)
Step 7: When your significant other or roommate leaves the room, replace purring cat (if riled by your attempt to get up), rewind show as needed, and resume viewing.

Overview: Very good, but not as good as Michael Keaton!!!
Before I get into my review, I want to give you a little bit of background: I’m a huge Michael Keaton fan and a software developer. Recently, I sold my start-up to a large tech conglomerate for several million dollars. I used that money to build a bunker inside an abandoned warehouse where I would live and wait for Michael Keaton to arrive so I can ask him a few continuity-related questions about his seminal 1996 comedy, Multiplicity, for my podcast: The Podkeast. I won’t list the questions here because I am certain they’ve never been asked and I want to be sure I’m the ones who asks them (more on this below, when I get into the complaints).
I need peace in my bunker to record episodes of The Podkeast and also to meditate and prepare myself for the eventual interview. Luckily, it’s soundproof. That brought up another issue, though: if I can’t hear anything, how will I know when Mike (that’s what I call him in my head sometimes) has arrived?
That’s where The Lynx 1080P Camera comes in! The quality’s great, they’re easy to set up, there’s free cloud storage, and most importantly, it has facial recognition. Using photos, I trained mine to only recognize one face: Michael Keaton’s. Thus, I’ll get a check-in notification whenever he arrives (fingers crossed, any day now!). Any other unfamiliar face alerts that come through I just ignore, because like I said, I don’t need the distractions.
I should say: I do have two complaints. One is that the Lynx recognizes faces really well, but not always the material said faces are made of. What I’m getting at is that my mom keeps showing up in a really realistic Michael Keaton mask (she probably bought it with the start-up money I gave her, ugh!). She always says the same thing: that she’s worried I might be losing my mind. It makes me want to scream. Like, of course I’m losing my mind! I got a check-in notification and thought Michael Friggin’ Keaton was here! And sometimes I do scream. Hey, it’s a sound-proof bunker, gotta get your money’s worth, right?
The other complaint I have is that Michael Keaton has not shown up to do the interview with me. This is probably more a don’t-have-Michael-Keaton’s-contact-info problem than a Lynx problem, but still: with that AND the mask issue, I didn’t feel right giving it five stars.
Overall, though, a very good camera!"	0.05			2018-09-24T04:00:11.601Z	0.2044531578210335	0.94	74861

When it comes to celebrating milestones, different people demand different amounts of ceremony. Some will require you to wear tuxedos and dinner gowns to the their wedding in a restored factory-turned-theater-space, wherein they will prepare a choreographed song and dance commemorating the various defining moments of their relationship. Others will go to the courthouse, sign a few documents, and send a text imploring you to meet them for beers later.
Whether it be a birthday, a successful defense of a PhD dissertation, or a housewarming party–everyone’s a little different. Not everyone wants gifts. But herein lies the one consistent rule, regardless of an event’s formality: if you’re bringing a gift, you have to put it in something festive. Because even the most casual soon-to-be mom isn’t going to stoked when you show up with a onesie still in the shipping box from VintageOnsiesRUs․com.
The problem? Wrapping is stressful. Wrap a gift poorly and you look like a degenerate. Wrap a gift too ornately and you seem like a bit of an over-achiever. Besides, not everything is easy to wrap. If you want to wrap an overstuffed plush starfish, you can either a) put it in a box and wrap that, or b) get your friend who’s an aerospace engineer to help you get the measurements and scissor placement just right so that it doesn’t come out looking like garbage.
Really, your best bet is to put that overstuffed plush starfish into a gift bag. Because the gift bag always looks good. It’s as fun-looking as wrapping paper and as easy as a shipping box. Plus, getting a gift in a gift bag rules. You’re basically getting two gifts, one of which you’re more than encouraged to regift later when you need to give someone else a gift.

You’ll notice that you have two choices on today’s sale. One is reasonable. The other is unreasonable. Or should we say: the other is an UNREASONABLY GOOD DEAL! You know what that means. It’s the return of:
ORDER/HOARDER
For those are unfamiliar, Order/Hoarder is when we offer you two options: a normal number of things for a good price, or an abnormally large number of things for a GREAT price. Today’s product:
Cooling towels!!!
So, let’s break it down:
The Math
“You can’t put a price on cool.” That’s something someone said in a movie once. It doesn’t matter who or what movie or if I just made it up, because it’s not true. You can put a price on being cool.
For example, if you just want to be double-cool (as in, get two cooling towels) you have to pay $12. That comes down to the totally reasonable per towel price of $6 (especially considering they’re $10 over on Amazon).
Now, here’s where it gets a bit more complicated. As we like to point out on these sales, when figuring out the price per unit of the Hoarder order, it’s not as simple as dividing the overall price ($36) by the number of units (12). BECAUSE, your can choose either 2 or 12, no in-betweens. Therefore, if you think about it, you’re already paying $6 for each of the first 2 towels, which means the last 10 towels are only costing you $24, or a mere $2.40 per towel! How about that deal, huh?!
What you can do with a normal order
It’s pretty simple. Cooling towels are not exactly all that, well, cool, but they are functional. With just two of them, you can use one as your main post-workout cool-down towel, and give the other to your spouse or partner. Or you can cycle through both yourself so you don’t have to do laundry as often.
What can you do with a Hoarder order
So much more! Here are just a few suggestions:


Go a day early and leave a cooling towel at each mile marker of your upcoming 20K race, so you never have to worry about getting too hot.


Take all of them and fashion them into a suit or cocktail dress to wear to outdoor weddings. But would a suit or dress made out of cooling towels really be classy enough for something like that? you might ask. To which we would respond: Could it be any less classy than a suit or dress soaked with sweat?


Sure, you could spend a bunch of money on an air conditioner and then a bunch of more money each month to run it. Or, you could save some cash by sewing yourself a delightful cooling towel quilt!


They’d make a great napkin alternative at your 12-guest “super spicy food banquet”.


Are you a do-gooder teen? Do you often dream of fashioning rope ladders out of clothes and blankets to lower yourself out your 2nd story bedroom window so you can run around after bedtime with your new rebellious friends? Only, your palms get so sweaty that you can’t get a good grip? Gosh, if only you could make a rope ladder out of something cool and soothing to the touch!


See? Maybe we were wrong. Maybe 12 cooling towels isn’t an unreasonable amount of cooling towels at all. On the other hand, you still have the option of buying the (completely boring) 2-pack. The decision is yours!

Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a child. Let’s call him @Dave. Dave wore Sears-brand Toughskin jeans. They were, as their name implied, durable and long-lasting. But, like most economically practical things, corners needed to be cut to keep them affordable, and, unfortunately for Dave, the corner Toughskin jeans cut was the let’s-make-these-things-look-cool corner.
Or maybe not unfortunately. Because Dave rarely felt self-conscious in his Toughskin jeans. What did make him feel self-conscious was when, in the mid-80s, his grandparents splurged and got him a Generra sweatshirt. It was “in.” Very “in.” In fact, you could say that it was so deeply “in” that the brand couldn’t find its way out of the decade.
Suddenly, all the other kids at school were stopping Dave in the hallway to say, “Cool sweatshirt,” and, after years of remaining invisible behind the Toughskin curtain, he didn’t know how to react to such a compliment. It was uncomfortable.
Dave has come a long way since then… or has he? No, he doesn’t wear Toughskin jeans anymore, but he still has a Toughskin mindset. He’s not afraid of bright purple laptops or speakers that are loud in both function and design. This, in some ways, is his calling: espousing the virtues of things that don’t look exactly like you’d hope but work just fine.
But he doesn’t exactly know what to do with these slick-looking Rowkin Bluetooth Ear Buds.
Does he say: just because Meh sells some stuff that has substance but lacks style does NOT mean the stylish stuff we sell lacks substance in equal measure? Does he point out that many of the negative reviews on Amazon that have driven the average rating down to an unimpressive 3 stars can be put into 3 categories:

people complaining about the hefty (non-Meh) price tag;
people who struggled with a weird issue that was corrected easily by a factory reset; and

As we’ve mentioned before, we recently won an auction for a storage locker that was filled entirely with branded content romance novels. Or so we thought. But, picking through the titles, we actually found many belonged to a branded content epic fantasy series by the author L.L.R. Holdien about a warrior named Tarklaw The Powerful. Luckily for us, there’s a chapter in book 19 about today’s product, the Keysmart (and Keysmart Pro).

Having successfully freed the shape-shifting wizard Vintel, son of Filor The Great, from the floating prison of Delkabana, narrowly escaping the light-spears of the Meschlen Guards by leaping through a portal leading somewhere that only a seer like Wise Crin might intuit–Tarklaw found himself deposited into murky waist-high water.
“Vintel?” Tarklaw called out, trying to locate the wizard whom he had just a moment ago saved, despite their families’ centuries-long acrimonious relations.
“I’m right here, Tarklaw,” Vintel seemed to whisper into his ear, buzzingly. “As a shape-shifting wizard, it is my custom to acclimate my shape to the environs, and so I have taken the form a mosquito because we, bitter-family-enemy-turned-savior, appear to be in a swamp.”
“Not just any swamp! The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors!” came a voice that belonged neither to Tarklaw or Vintel, but another in their vicinity. Tarklaw turned quickly, drawing his great sword with a shing sound common of sword-drawing. But he found only a small creature not unlike an unshelled tortoise, swimming towards them. “Forgive me for startling you! I am Rewn, peaceful leader of the Melorians, the primary inhabitants of this swamp at the edge of the Planet Glor at the far reaches of the Heplan Galaxy. Now, I imagine you’ve come here through some pesky portal or other, but fear not: your exit is easily made through one of the Eight Astounding Doors.”
“Doors?” Said Tarklaw. “I am from the planet Phentalon, a place without doors, due to our peoples’ openness with each other.”
“Very noble,” Rewn said. “Perhaps one day, The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors shall be like that. For now, you must choose one. They go to any number of worlds, from the euphorically beautiful mountain-scape of Relan to the hellish fire-deserts of Dumask. And we have all the keys right here…” Rewn dipped under the water for a moment, but re-emerged with a perplexed look upon his creaturely face. “Oh, dear! They were right there a moment ago.”
“You simply allow all keys to be strewn throughout a swamp?” buzzed Vintel.
“Not exactly,” Rewn said, explanatorily. “We keep them all together using an ingenious contraption known as a KeySmart. Made of aircraft aluminum, it can hold eight keys–or as many as fourteen, with an expansion pack! Additionally, it includes a loop for keys belonging to vehicles propelled by motors. Not to mention, its extended frame can hold long or foreign keys, which is especially important to us, as one of our oldest and most prized keys is made from the hollow bird-like finger bone of the fallen Hilderan Mage Lazlorn.”
“But,” Vintel buzzed, contrarily, “as ingenious and organizationally optimized as that all sounds, it seems at present not to be helping in your ability to locate them.”
“Ah, yes, that would be true if it were the base model, which is still good,” Rewn said. “Luckily for us, we opted for the Pro. Not only does it have a built-in LED flashlight and bottle opener; it can also show a map of your missing keys, and by way of the Tile app–which can be accessed via your smartphone or tablet–you can make your keys ring out loud! Of course, I should add at this juncture that the ‘water’ here in the The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors is different in elemental makeup to that of the water on other planets, such as Earth.”
“Are you saying,” Vintel buzzed, clarifyingly, “that just because we are discussing the KeySmart Pro being used in a water-based situation, it should not be taken as an endorsement of it being waterproof?”
“Exactly,” cried Rewn, disclaimingly.
“Much like doors, smartphones and tablets are concepts foreign to my home world,” Tarklaw said. “But that sounds like a great functional product nonetheless.”
“And I will show you just how functional it is!” Rewn cried with excitement. He brought forward a device and opened the Tile app. A moment later, a ding rang out, though it sounded muffled. The three of them turned… and stood facing a giant glowing snake-like beast. It emerged from the water, standing nearly forty Glorian theltans tall, or forty feet tall in Earth measurements, Glorian theltans being exactly equal to terrestrial feet. The ding sounded again, from somewhere deep inside of the monster’s abdomen.
“Oh no! A Mirelord! Run!” Rewn cried with fear. “Or, better yet, swim.” And with that, he disappeared under the water.
But Tarklaw did not swim away. He crouched into a combat ready position as best he could in the deep murky water. The Mirelord leaned closer to him, its eyes alight with evil.
“What are you doing?” buzzed Vintel into his ear, questioningly.
“We must get out of this swamp,” Tarklaw cried. “This is the only way. Though, it will be hard for just the two of us to defeat it…”
“Perhaps, I can help?” came a distinguished voice from Tarklaw’s side.
Tarklaw turned, and saw… no! He couldn’t believe it! “Hinton, son of Raquille, wielder of The Great Axe Of Orlagos, and best friend since birth of Tarklaw The Powerful? But I thought you were–”
“The immortal prisoner of the Inter-dimensional Pirate Lop, locked away in the his ship, The Pummeling Ewlok, for all of eternity?” Hinton laughed. “Not a chance in Dumask, my friend! Now, what do you say we free the aforementioned product from the belly of the beast? Just like old times?”
Tarklaw couldn’t help but smile. “Just like old times, indeed,” he said, and they raised their weapons to the approaching Mirelord."	0.05			2018-09-19T04:00:10.856Z	0.34612555704581827	0.93	72268

One time, I left without remembering to close the door.
I was living in a house somewhere so rural we didn’t need to lock up, and, in a rush to leave (I was going on a trip), I forgot to swing the door all the way closed, leaving only the screen door between my cat and freedom. He was fine. My mom checked on him the next day and, much to her surprise, he emerged from under the deck after spending what must’ve been, for an indoor cat, a terrifying night outside.
Just about every time I have left the house since then, even if just for an hour, I have wondered: “did I close the door? Did I lock the door? Do the pets have food? Do they have water? Did I leave the oven on? Did I unconsciously light seven candles and place them precariously close to window curtains that are, unbeknownst to me, highly flammable?” Many times, I have gone back to check. Never have I left the stove on. Never have I found candles flickering. The pets have always been fine. Only once or twice have I found the door unlocked.
Still, I never regret it, because it’s nicer to know everything’s fine than it is to hope everything’s fine.
And that’s really what these Zmodo MeShare cameras are for: making sure. You can call them “security cameras,” but that feels a little overstated. Maybe it would be better to rebrand them as “check-in cameras.” After all, the chances that you’re going to tune in as your home is being burglarized–thus allowing you to call the authorities while the burglary is in progress–is very low. I mean, hell, the actual likeliness of your home being burglarized at all is very low. And if your first thought upon reading that is, Nuh-uh, my home gets broken into all the time, we won’t argue with you. But we will say: you probably need more than a couple Zmodos.
Otherwise, these are a good option for the second-guessers out there to quell all the concerns that might flare up during your day at work: whether you just want to make sure everything’s fine, or to check that you didn’t forget to close the windows, or to monitor whether your dog is feeling okay after eating something stupid that he wasn’t supposed to…

The second thing you need to know is that the backs velcro on, and the seats have magnets in them, which makes them “infinitely configurable.” And yet, if that’s the case, then why is are these proposed layouts so BORING?! They’re mostly just couches. Where’s the fun in that? Why not try something more exciting, like these three designs:
You’re Number One

Will anyone even see that it’s a #1? Probably not. Is it really a practical way to lay out a room? No. But the subliminal reassurance that the design will provide for your child is massive. Every time they sit down they’ll think, “Hey, you know what: I’m special!” And this confidence will push them to do great things.
Game Room

Checkers is simple and boring on a board… but what about in a room, with you and all of your friends as the pieces? To make it more exciting: institute a rule where it’s not as easy as just “jumping” another piece; instead, you have to battle for it. Whoever doesn’t get cast into one of the empty spaces (i.e. onto the floor) wins!
Soft Kitchen

Okay, this isn’t exactly innovative, design-wise. But in terms of utility? Think about it: you cover the floor of your kitchen, wall-to-wall, with Sactionals, and now, suddenly, you can drop a glass or a ceramic mug and it won’t shatter! Plus, they’re machine washable, in case there’s a spill. Best of all, if you need to keep an eye on something you’ve got baking, you can just lay down next to the oven and watch it!

Dear @reclaimercube,
On September 2nd, you posted the following comment on a knife sale:

Meh I have anxiously been awaiting for you to post a toothbrush for sale again. I will post this everyday until you finally sell another one again.

And, @reclaimercube, can we tell you something? We’re very proud of you. Because you kept your word. Since then, each day, you’ve put forward this same request.
Your fellow Meh customers began to notice. One post from Friday, September 7th sparked a discussion that involved more than 20 comments. In that conversation, someone pointed out a toothbrush for sale on a competitor’s site. You, ever strong, refused to take the bait:

not a bad deal… But not on meh so it doesn’t matter. You could link me to colgate’s website or crest’s website for a free toothbrush and I still wouldn’t want it unless it was on meh. I’m chaining myself to this statue. Ride or die mehbrother.

Your repeated request did not specify why you wanted a toothbrush, or what kind of toothbrush you wanted. Really, you haven’t even promised that you’d buy the toothbrush. You’ve only asked, repeatedly, for us to “post a toothbrush.”
Well, good news, @reclaimercube: when we launched Meh, we made a decision. Once, and only once, we would allow a Meh customer to dictate exactly what we’d sell. The only rule was they had to make the request for 13 consecutive days. They could ask for $1 MacBooks, or free puppies, or Cadillac Escalades filled with cash. It didn’t matter. There were no restrictions, aside from the 13 days. Some of us worried the financial hit would be too much, but others felt assured: we could trust our customers! They wouldn’t make unreasonable demands!
So thank you, @reclaimercube; you’ve shown us that our faith was not misplaced. Now, Meh community, let’s all come together and celebrate with this build-your-own-bundle of toothbrushes.
Sincerely,
Meh

Hair: it is the ultimate example of disobedience.
You can train puppies to pee outside, to walk next to you, to sit, to shake, to do any number of fun and/or useful things. With cats, the job is much harder, but with some persistence (and a spray bottle) it is possible to enforce a few rules: you do not yowl in the middle of the night, you do not walk on the kitchen counter, you do not knock our decorative trinkets off the mantle as a game. Even a bonsai can be coaxed, over time, to grow a certain way.
But not hair. Nope, no matter how many times you comb, shave, style, epilate, and wax: it can just never take the fucking hint!
You know that person in your  your life who’s like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “hmm, maybe?” And you hope they’ll just drop it, but then a day later, they’re like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “I don’t know if that dumb thing is really a good idea.” Which should be clear as hell, but they don’t want to listen, so they keep prodding and prodding until you’re like, “Look,  I don’t want to do the dumb thing because it is dumb, and honestly, I’m worried you might be dumb for suggesting it, and I might be dumb for being the friend of such a dumb person.” And you feel terrible but they just smile and say, “C’mon! It’ll be great!”
That’s hair. No matter how many times you try to send the message that you don’t want it to come back there, it keeps coming back there. It is untrainable!
Or is that the wrong way to look at it? Could it be that we are the untrainable ones? That our hair is not being a stubborn learner but a tenacious teacher? That it wants to lead us to a better place? A place where we eschew the standards of beauty thrust upon us? Because isn’t it pretty arbitrary where we say there should be hair and where we say there should not? On the head is good, but not on the face? Except some faces capable of growing thick enough hair? On the chest is okay, but no, never on the back? Not on the legs, but okay on the arms, except in the armpits? Could it be that our hair’s persistence is its way of saying: you need to get the hell over it and just be who you are?

The three brothers had been cleaning out their grandfather’s basement for nearly two hours before they found the FoodSaver.
“What’s this?” said Kyle, holding it up.
“Looks old,” said Jake. “I’d guess circa second half of the 2010’s.”
Terry took it from Kyle and inspected it. “Wait, I know these things. It’s an early model weed-sealer. You know? The devices for vacuum-packing weed so it wouldn’t go bad.”
“All this talk of weed remind me, have you guys taken your three o’clock edibles yet?” Jake asked.
Kyle and Terry nodded.
“But wait,” Kyle said, “why does it say FoodSaver on it, if it’s for weed?”
“You have to understand, Kyle, this was before weed was legal everywhere,” Terry explained. “They didn’t even put it in the water back then!”
Kyle looked at the FoodSaver perplexed. “Really?”
“I’m serious,” Terry said. “So people weren’t as acclimated to it as we are now. They considered it a drug. Thus, when people took some, they got ‘high,’ which basically meant they thought without logic. So it’s likely that the inventor of the ‘FoodSaver’ only named it such because he was super high, and probably pretty hungry.”
“So strange to think that the same substance that keeps us calm and measured, used to have almost the opposite effect!” Kyle said.
Now Jake had the FoodSaver. “Are you sure this is a weed-sealer? To me, it looks like an early sous-vide-assistant. That would make more sense with the FoodSaver name.”
“Did they even sous vide back then?” Terry asked.
“Sure,” Jake said. “It was more of a luxury, though, given that it was before the Microwave And Oven Act of 2035.”
“When I read about those times, and all the negative-energy-pollution caused by those now illegal kitchen appliances, it just makes me sick,” Terry said.
“Guys, you’ve got me thinking…” Kyle paused to gather his thoughts. “Well, you know how when we put stuff in the freezer, it just freezes together and gets covered in weird ice?”
“They’re called water diamonds, Kyle,” Terry said.
“They mean the moisture has accepted the food, so we know it’s safe to eat,” Jake said.
“I’m well aware of them and what they mean. Don’t forget, I’m the one who studied health at Dove For Men Presents: College. But I was thinking, the food doesn’t always taste good after the water diamonds form.” Kyle took the FoodSaver from Jake. “And I know this is going to sound crazy, but if this thing could keep weed fresh, and be used with food products for sous-vide purposes, maybe we could combine the two functions. Like, we could use it to seal food before we freeze it so it stays fresher longer.”
“You mean, you want to eat food that’s been frozen but hasn’t emitted its proper water diamonds?” Terry said.
“Isn’t that illegal?” Jake added.
“Sure, on Earth. But not here,” Kyle said, “on Mars.”
Jake and Terry had to admit he had a point: they definitely had been on Mars this whole time."	0.05			2018-09-13T04:00:05.184Z	0.21097046413502127	0.92	62121

As someone who doesn’t brush his hair much, Wet Brushes look, to me, like normal brushes. But looks can be deceiving. Or, in this case, the looks are deceivingly simple.

The Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet is pretty simple: it’s a wallet that comes with a powerpack, which can be used to charge your phone or other devices.
In a way, to recharge something is to refill it, but unfortunately, while the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet does fill your wallet in the literal sense–like, there is a powerpack inside of it–it can’t refill your wallet in the figurative sense–as in, recharge your bank account.
Or can it?
Because think about this: what kind of phone is the most likely to have a short battery life? An old phone! And maybe you have an upgrade waiting for you, but you don’t want to dish out the money for one. Because maybe, with your provider, it’s not as simple as handing over $200 and getting a new iPhone. Now, you pay for the upgrade via a small increase in your monthly bill–a small increase that over time accumulates into a lot of money. And it’s very possible that this change was made because people like you: people who buy a phone and then ride it into the ground, thus spending a couple hundred bucks every six years, rather than evert two like your cell company–let’s call them Werizon–would prefer.
And so now you’ve got a geriatric phone that needs a pick-me-up every few hours to make it through the day, and you’re not always near an outlet, so one of these Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallets–‘wallets’ plural because you get a 2-pack–is just what you need. It’s your wallet, so it’s not like you’ll forget it. Thus, you’ll always have some charge on hand, which means you don’t need to upgrade, which means your phone bill won’t go up, which means you’ll save money, which, in conclusion, means the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet can, in fact, recharge both your phone and your wallet!

I remember being a kid, riding in my parents’ car at night, and dropping something. Maybe a toy or a quarter. It doesn’t matter what. What matters is I reached up and turned on the dome light to find the object in question. And it was then that my dad freaked the fuck out. You would’ve thought I’d tossed hot acid in his eyes. “Turn that off! I can’t see anything!” he claimed. He might’ve even swerved a little, for emphasis. As a dutiful child, I switched the light off as quickly as possible to avoid careening off the road into a ditch.
Flash forward some years: I have a license. I have a car. A friend is riding with me. He turns on the dome light for something and… everything is fine.
The same thing happened the first time I helped jumpstart a car. I’d been told so many times about everything that can go terribly wrong that I felt sure that it would end in a) an deadly storm of electricity and fire; or b) one or both of the cars being fried for good. Turns out, if you, ya know, just follow instructions, it works out fine.
If anything, the greatest risk of jumping a car–the one that no amount of how-to articles or Youtube videos can save you from–is the risk of wasting a favor. Because think about it: you spend all that time being a good friend and building up positive equity until you’ve almost got enough to cash in for pet care or help shlepping some furniture from your old apartment to your new one… Then your car battery farts out and now your buddy is driving over in the cold to help you get it started again.
That’s where this iJoy Jump Starter Kit comes in. Not only will it charge your phone and provide some you with some light; it’ll make it so that you don’t need to dip into the favor bank just to get your car running.

Another super villain attacking the city, another mad rush downtown. We newspaper photographers are the real heroes, Roy thought to himself with a chuckle as he ran from the Gazette office into the mayhem, clutching his camera to his chest.
It was a joke, of course. Roy didn’t think he was more heroic than the Scarlet Savior. But he could relate to her in one way: like her, he never had any help. After layoffs there were just two of them in the photography department; they outsourced the rest. And it just so happened that whenever disaster struck, Lorraine was rushing off to take care of “a personal issue.”
What a coincidence, Roy thought. Always trying to get out of work! Then something else occurred to him: was it possible that Lorraine was, in fact, the alter ego of–
A taxi honked at Roy as he sprinted across the street toward the sounds of lasers and maniacal laughter a few blocks away. “Watch where you’re going buddy!” the diver yelled.
“I’m working!” Roy yelled back.
“Yeah, yeah,” the driver said. “Well, we’re all working too. Working on staying alive in this damn city!”
Roy laughed. Not at the man but at the theory the honk had charitably eradicated from his mind. Lorraine couldn’t be the Scarlet Savior. Sure, they both had striking red hair, but the Scarlet Savior always wore a matching Treasure Island jewelry set–one necklace, one bracelet, both made out of genuine gemstones and pearls–whereas Lorraine wore a single longer Treasure Island necklace, which was also made of genuine gemstones and pearls.
Well, that settles that! Roy thought. And just in time too! Because here she came, the Scarlet Savior, flying through the sky, blazing a red path through the sky that, strangely, looked like it originated on the roof of the Gazette’s offices.

We’re dropping the price of both but not by the same amount: for the one with multiple zippers, the price will be just a buck lower, whereas, the single-zipper version will be a whopping $5 less than last time. For those keeping score at home: that’s now a $9 difference between the two.
In some ways, this isn’t simply a sale; it’s an experiment. We want to answer the question: what is a zipper truly worth?

There are three potential outcomes to buying this Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk:
Outcome 1
You buy the standing desk. You’re intrigued by its promises of a stronger core, healthier circulation, improved productivity, and better posture. But the truth is, you don’t care for it. You’ve spent your entire life believing that getting work done requires sitting down and shutting up. So how do you expect, as an adult, to change your working position? Maybe if you gave it more time… but you don’t want to. You just want to use it as a normal desk. And that’s fine! Because this thing didn’t cost north of $600 like some models out there; it cost less than $200. And look, that’s not nothing, but it was a worthwhile gamble.
Outcome 2
You love your new standing desk. But it’s not enough. Once you taste the thrill of working upright, you want more. You quickly replace your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk with a treadmill desk. You start out walking, but soon enough you’re outright sprinting while you manage your spreadsheets and respond to emails. You get a kiddy pool and set it up behind the treadmill, filling it with a medley of pirañas and water moccasins. Now, any slowdown and you’re in trouble. But even that’s not enough. You take out the water moccasins, extract their venom, and put it in an IV that runs directly into your arm. The anti-venom is in another IV that you’ve rigged to only administer as you meet your hourly sales goals. Your friends and family members are worried about you, but you’ve never felt more alive! And it all started with the Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk!
Outcome 3
You get your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk, and you like it. You crank it up to standing height for a few hours of the day; for the rest of the time, you use it as a normal desk. You’re neither disappointed, nor unsatisfied. It meets your needs, and you will use it for the foreseeable future.

Shaving is the blandest and yet most grueling task of every personal grooming regimen. It is a zero sum game: you can put it off, but that only means it’ll be a longer and more grueling process when eventually you do get around to it. It’s like mowing the lawn, except without the exercise, and the smell of fresh cut grass replaced by the noxious chemical odor of shave gel. In short, it’s miserable.
Or it was. Until now. Enter these “Famous Maker” razors. Famous Maker? you say. But who IS the famous maker? That’s just the thing, we can’t tell you. And now suddenly, shaving is an act of immeasurable mystery and excitement!
Could it be that these razors are the excess produced by an underground razor factory located far below Park City? Perhaps for the original purpose of being distributed, in secret, to the agents and publicists and personal assistants of actors in town for the Sundance Film Festival? So that these various agents and publicists and assistants could sneak into the actors’ hotel rooms at night and shave their faces clean while they slept? Because maybe the actors, having escaped the always-on environs of Los Angeles, wanted to let themselves go, but the various men and women whose livelihoods relied on their pristine image had other things in mind?
Or could it be that the razors are from a different hidden factory, a facility built into the side of one of the Alps? For a baron? A baron who volunteered to host the worldwide beard and mustache contest at his expansive villa? While harboring a secret hatred of all facial hair? And so the plan was not to celebrate these growers of elaborate beards and mustaches, but to trap them and then use the razors to, as the baron said in a private correspondence, “reveal their cheeks upper lips once again to the world”? Maybe he even wanted to shave the hair on their head too, just to prove a point? Only his scheme was discovered by the lowly helper-boy tasked with taking his correspondence to the post office? And so the baron had no choice but to sell off his stock of razors in an effort to cut (pun intended) his losses?
Or could it be a pretty basic story of a razor company having some leftover razors that they wanted to offload? Only they couldn’t do so under their own name? Because then people would be like, “but wait, I just spent this much on these at the store, but now you’re selling them for cheap online? That’s bullshit!”?
Okay, for purposes of whimsy, let’s just ignore that last scenario. Instead, focus on the first two, buy these razors, and shave with an entirely new sense of intrigue!"	0.05			2018-09-05T04:00:15.298Z	0.26119278036366067	0.93	62903

Can I level with you here: I’m just not much a knife guy. I have a set of good kitchen knives and that’s about it. I open boxes with my keys cut through frustrating packaging with a pair of scissors. I don’t mean any judgment. I’m just being honest. The problem is, I have to write about this knife, and I can’t just say, “Uh, I don’t know? It’s fine, probably?”
Or so I thought…
Then I went to do some research on Amazon and saw a question about what material was used to make the pivot washers and how thick the blade is. The first answer reads as follows:

Sorry, this was a gift for someone in Arizona so I can’t answer your question. I can only say that the knife is substantial!

Wait, seriously? This is allowed? Admitting that you don’t know the answer… counts as an answer?! Well then friends, I’ve got some great news: I can answer all the questions you have about this 2-Pack of C.R.K.T. Ruger Go-N-Heavy Compact VEFF Serrated Knives! Let’s do it!
So, how thick is the blade?
Great question! I’d guess that it’s probably about the same as other knives like it, although it could be thicker. But even then, it wouldn’t be too much thicker, because that would be weird, right?
I’m reading that it has a “stonewashed drop-point blade.” That sounds intense. What kind of stuff can you use it for?
I bet it would be pretty good at cutting through most stuff you’d use a knife like this for, but I don’t feel comfortable naming specific stuff because I’ve never used one. I will say this, though: there’s a good chance it can cut through butter. And an even better chance if the butter has been left out of the fridge for a little while.
Was it designed by Bill Harsey?
Sure was! As to who Bill Haresay is, lol, idk! I would venture to guess he does something in the knife industry.
One reviewer says that it is 11.8"" long when it’s extended. Is that longer than other knives?
Not sure. It is definitely not as long as a foot, because a foot is 12"". With that being said, another reviewer posted a photo of it next to another knife and a tape measurer, if that helps. It is bigger than the other knife, but not the tape measurer (which is good, because those things can get really long).
Wow! This is so easy! It’s great to finally realize how much a knife expert I really am! Thanks Amazon question answerer, for showing me the way.

This Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble may seem simple enough. It’s 6 100% ceramic products with matching designs: a toothbrush holder, a tumbler, a soap dish, a lotion dispenser, a tissue box, and a trash bin. None of these things require much explanation. What does deserve some attention, though, is the multi-stage process that one goes through when deciding to buy one or all of them. We’ve laid it out below:
Stage 1: Intrigue
These are interesting. The various pieces look stylish, and they all match. It might be nice to have a motif that really brings the entire bathroom together.
Stage 2: Skepticism
But do I really need any of these? The old coffee mug we put the toothbrushes in works just fine, as does the little wicker basket we’ve got for trash. The sink already has a built-in soap dish. This one would be easier to clean, but do you really need to clean something when all it does is hold soap? Isn’t soap itself essentially the concept of cleanliness made solid? Lotion bottles already come with a pump top and tissue boxes are their own tissue dispensers, really. Am I supposed to re-package things? Isn’t that adding unnecessary steps?
Stage 3: Re-evaluation
Yes, I guess technically it is adding unnecessary steps, but all in the service of style. And maybe that’s worth it. Which would maybe mean the steps aren’t unnecessary?
*Stage 4: Introspection
And what does it say about me that I’m so put off by these objectively simple tasks? Like, it isn’t hard to empty some lotion from one thing into another thing. It isn’t hard to put a box of tissues inside another box. Or clean a soap dish. Just like it isn’t hard to put a new bag in the garbage after I take the trash out. But I never do, not right away at least. I always wait hours, sometimes even a whole day, leaving paper towels and granola bar wrappers on the kitchen counter, until finally my desire for a clean surface outweighs my laziness. At which point I put a new bag in the garbage can and am reminded that the laziness was all to avoid something that takes mere seconds. And yet, when next I need to take out the trash, this process will repeat. Making matters worse: someday it might not just be taking out the trash. Someday it might be dirty diapers I’m dealing with. It might be taking kids to the doctor. It might taking the medication I need to stay alive. And when that time comes will I just attempt to put it off? I want to say no, that I’ll be past all of this by then, that I’ll finally be a responsible organized adult… but an I’m adult now, damnit! I should already be better than this!
Stage 5: Ascension
That’s it! No more! I’m going to buy every item in this Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble, not just because it’s stylish and will tie my bathroom together nicely! No, that’s all secondary. Really, I’m doing it to prove to everyone–but especially myself–that I’m capable of taking the right steps and building good habits! New me, here we come!
Stage 6: Regression
Purchase made! Now, it’s time for bed. Shit, wait? It’s trash day tomorrow, isn’t it? I should take the bin to the curb. Although, there really are only a couple bags in there. I’m sure I’d be fine until next week…"	0.07			2018-09-01T04:00:01.758Z	0.3734081588603498	0.94	49783

There’s an old saying about innovation: “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.” It is derived from an Emerson quote that reads: “If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.” In this way, the saying is an example of itself; the ‘mousetrap’ variant is shorter, snappier, and conveys the exact same meaning, thus it is the one most often used.
The implication here is basically if you build it, they will come: you’ll have lines around the block, people from all over frantically waving their bills in the air demanding the latest in mouse-entrapment technology.
The truth, we know now, is a bit different.
The world, upon beating a path to your door, would say, “This mousetrap is smaller and more humane than the previous mousetrap, but now I’ve decided I want a mousetrap that is smaller and more humane.” Or, “I have no mice in my house, but many spiders, and this mousetrap did not catch a single spider, which is a bit of a disappointment.” Or, “Excuse me, I have some ideas for how you might make this better mousetrap–which is a good start–into an even greater mousetrap, despite the fact that I have never myself built any mousetrap.”
And so it goes with the Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Pack. You can put it in the microwave if you need heat, or you can put in the freezer if you want it to be cold. The ceramic beads heat and cool with the gel, providing a nice texture, which one Amazon reviewer says, “makes for an easy massage.” But the title of that review–“slightly different than the norm”–is telling. It implies that the incorporation of a heretofore never used component is something slight. Innovation, people seem to believe, requires a total redo.
Yes, some reviews expressed issues with durability. That’s understandable to call out. A few wished it would be more pliable when frozen. Again, fair.
But then there are the other “complaints.”
One says: “The only drawback I’ve seen so far to this item is its size. For the most part, I don’t think the size will be an issue because it’s probably rare to treat an area larger than 6x10”.""
Just so we’re clear: the only issue this reviewer could foresee would arise in a scenario that they couldn’t foresee arising.
Another–in a review titled “Does the job but not much better than competition”–claims: “the problem is just like every other reusable gel back I’ve ever used: they simply don’t remain truly hot or cold enough for long enough to do a good job. They’re more warm or cool than they are hot or cold for much longer.”
To put it differently: the biggest problem with this product, in this reviewer’s experience, is endemic to this entire product category, not just this product, and relies upon a universal tolerance of hot and cold temperatures.
The point of all this is to show that people will always find things to gripe about. And maybe they’re right. Still, it seems like the best case scenario is that you really love the texture of the ceramic beads inside the gel, and the worst case scenario is that you get three of totally passable hot/cold packs for $18.

Here we go again! The return of The Skeptics Choice, our occasional write-up segment wherein we read what a product claims to do and say, “hmm… I don’t know…” Today, we’re talking about a PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser. Follow along, won’t you?
The Claim
For all those who are thinking that we’ve been through this all before, fear not: this is a different kind of diffuser than the one we sold last time. This one is a “one-of-a-kind product combines the therapeutic properties of a pure Himalayan salt rock lamp with the soothing aromatherapy of an essential oil diffuser.” Apparently, it sets “the perfect mood for relaxation at home” and provides “all the benefits you would expect from this powerful combo.”
The Skepticism
That last part is a little presumptuous. All the benefits I would expect? I understand each word in the phrase “Himalayan Salt Lamp” on its own, but I know nothing about what they mean when they’re put together. But that’s no bother! It’s all laid out right there in the marketing copy:


The first benefit is that it will “help boost your mood.” And honestly, that sounds legit! When you’ve had your windows shut for almost 12 consecutive months because it took just a single day for the seasons transition from the bitter cold of winter to the brutal humidity of summer, something that makes the air smell pretty can be a nice little pick-me-up.


The second benefit is that it can “increase energy levels.” This seems a little more like bullshit than the first claim, but it’s vague enough that I’m willing to give it a pass.


The third benefit is that it will “neutralize the positively charged ions that emit from electronic devices like smartphones, televisions, radios, and more.”


Umm, what the fuck? That sure escalated quickly.
Seriously, the difference in hysteria levels from “it might boost your mood” to “it’ll protect you from killer ions” is about equal to the difference between a “hang in there, kitty” poster and one of those spam posts from MySpace that was like, “Post this on 10 of your friends’ profiles or else your eyes will fall out.”
And by the way, I’m not against a lot of this stuff. Crystals are fine. Astrology is fine. You could argue that it’s unscientific, but that’s missing the point. Life sucks sometimes. If getting some stones to put in your pocket makes you feel less like you’re flying a cloud of chaos towards an inevitably disappointing conclusion, more power to you! I watch groups of men in polyester play what is basically an IRL-board game involving sticks and balls on an enormous grass-and-dirt field, and if the group of men I like outplays the group of men I don’t like, I feel profound happiness. So, I try not to judge people for the things they use to pass the time.
But I will ABSOLUTELY judge anyone who preys upon someone based on those things. Because that’s what they’re doing here. They’re not saying: “you like this thing? we make this thing~” They’re saying, “we make this thing! it is DANGEROUS not to have this thing!!!” In other words, it’s taking something that should be a distraction from the chaos of daily life–which it totally could be, by the way: it’s cool looking; it lights up; it smells nice–and turning it into part of the chaos of daily life. And that’s messed up.
(Also, sorta tangential but still relevant, it’s problematic in a whole other way: What’s dangerous about technology is not that it’s pumping the air full of ions; it’s how intrusive it is. For example, did you know that if you say “Bloody Mary” three times into your smart phone, an ad for “great local brunch spots” will appear on your Facebook timeline? Our devices are definitely listening to us. We can all agree on that, right? Fine, maybe I’m just being paranoid. But you have to know that every Google search, every purchase, every photo you post is being mined for important data. And so making it a conversation about “ions” is pushing it in a direction that helps no one but those selling PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffusers.)
The Conclusion
If you want a thing that lights up and looks cool and smells nice, this is a good investment. If you’re thinking about buying this because you’re afraid to breath in all the electro-turds you released into the air while binging Sharp Objects, maybe open a window?"	0.05			2018-08-30T04:00:02.770Z	0.20794343938448737	0.93	60935

1.

I’m a lawyer, but right now, I’m not in the courtroom. Instead, it’s late at night and I’m in my office, wearing Ray-Ban glasses, poring over all the evidence of this grueling case, trying to find something to prove my client is innocent. All the older lawyers at this firm didn’t want to take my client on, and I’m starting to see why, but then again, I’m a young perky go-getter. Sometimes I worry that I’m too concerned with upholding justice, that I get too wrapped up in what’s right and wrong, that I fall in love with too many of my clients. But I can’t think about that now. I need to squint through my Ray-Bans at this piece of paper, then dig out another piece of paper and squint at that one, before realizing I’ve found it: a small but pretty obvious detail that proves my client wasn’t there that night. Thanks, Ray-Bans! I couldn’t have done it without you.

2.

I’m a bit of a nerd. You can tell because I’m always wearing these thick Ray-Ban frames. Also, I’m always doing nerdy things like taking notes in class or carrying a lot of books. Sometimes I drop them, to the delight of cheerleaders and jocks. My best friend is quirky and outgoing, but I am not. I have a figure that would require a nutritionist and hours of gym time each day to maintain, but you can’t see it under these bulky sweaters that I wear, while sitting in my bedroom listening to non-aggressive indie rock or reading an obscure book like Wuthering Heights or The Collected Plays of William Shakespeare. Perhaps someday, someone will move here from out of town and crack this high school’s social hierarchy wide open, but until then it’s just me, my one quirky friend, my books, my sweaters, and my Ray-Ban glasses.

3.

I’m what you might call a savant. I’m always doing things like solving unsolvable math equations, or going to the park and playing five games of chess at a time… and winning. The crisp lines of my Ray-Ban frames are definitely in stark contrast with my wildly disheveled hair! Can I tell you something? I wasn’t surprised to see the government suits show up at my house. What did surprise me was when they took me to the research facility and showed me what they found. I stared at it for a whole a minute. Then I dramatically took off my Ray-Ban glasses, wiped them on my shirt, and stared at it for a minute longer. I didn’t know what I was looking at. What I did know was that, despite being just a guy from Queens (with the IQ of a Nobel laureate), I might save the world. Strap in, Ray-Bans! This is going to be a long ride!

Dearest Meh Customers,
Apparently, our minds cannot be trusted, and for that we are sorry.
You see, in our previous attempt to sell these M Cushions, we misinterpreted a few things. By which we mean, we mistook several vague comments about the massager being applied to unnamed areas beyond the back to mean…
Hmmm…
How do we say it exactly?
Let’s try this: we thought you were implying that the M Cushion could be applied to places where the combination of friction and heat might bring about sensations not unrelated to relief, but a step beyond relief, a sort of deep relief that goes by many names, one of which it shares with a term from film and literature meaning the culmination of the story’s drama.
But, um… apparently we were a little off-base. As one quoted commenter noted:

I swear I didn’t mean it in a sexual way. I just meant after leg day you can lean back in bed and use it on your aching thighs rather comfortably.

Time to dive into our library of branded content romance novels, for a tale of secrecy, royalty, and grilling. Please enjoy these excerpts from Coals Aflame by Criminy Highlater.

Grilling with one tool? Mary had gotten used to that thanks to her Starfrit Tonglite. In many ways, she was a lot like the 6-in-1 bbq multi-tool: she was strong, she had many skills, could do many things, and, since Eric had run off with his secretary a year before, she relied only on herself.
Which was what she planned to do that Saturday afternoon. Her work at the non-profit, helping troubled youth gain acceptance to Ivy League schools, didn’t leave her much time for making friends, so she would do it on her own. She would take a cooler, her little grill, and her Starfrit, and she would go from her apartment in Soho to Central Park to have a little cookout for one. It would be simple… or so she thought.
“M’lady, if I may have a word,” came a voice soon after she’d set up. Mary ignored it, thinking it sounded so British and refined that it must be coming from someone’s radio. But when it persisted, she looked up.
An austere and very handsome man stood in front of her.
“There you are,” he said. “I couldn’t help but gain sight of your grill, and I wondered if I might bequeath you of a favor?”
Mary had gotten good at doing things alone since Eric left, but there was something interesting about this man, something that made her desire his company.

The man said his name was Collin, and he worked for the a mysterious member of the royal family, Prince Nigel. Mary remembered seeing on the news that Nigel was making his first visit to the United States. She hadn’t listened to the story, because she’d been distracted by the strange mask the prince seemed to wear everywhere.
“What kind of work do you do for him?” Mary asked.
“All sorts,” was all Collin said.
“And so what can I help you with?” Mary asked.
“Well, being among the prince’s central envoy, I am privy to many of the finest restaurants in the world, but I don’t always want to partake in such luxury. And I was hoping you might allow me to dine with you, to take in a true American meal!”
“That’s it?” Mary asked. “You want a burger and some hot dogs?”
“'Tis my heart’s desire,” Collin said with a winning smile. “And if it would please you, I’d be happy to help. For example, perhaps I will unpack the remainder of the tools you require for grilling?”
Mary smiled and held up the Starfrit. “I only need one!”

Mary flipped burgers with the spatula when the upper arm was drawn back and rotated hot dogs with the tongs when the upper arm was extended. She opened them each a bottle of beer with the opener. “A fine colonial ale!” Collin said. Mary laughed, using the Starfrit’s serrated edge to cut the buns.
While they ate, Mary asked, “So is Prince Nigel really as eccentric as he seems?”
“You’re asking about the mask, I presume?”
Mary blushed. ""Well, I–
Collin laughed. “It’s no issue. It’s what everyone wants to know: why is he always wearing that strange masquerade mask, the one behind which he has hidden since his youth? Is his face disfigured? Is he some sort of lunatic? But the truth is, he simply desires privacy. He doesn’t want to be followed everywhere he goes.”
Mary opened her mouth, ready to say that this made sense–that she could not imagine what it must be like–when suddenly the sky went dark.
Nearby people screamed. Collin grabbed her hand, fearfully. “My god, it’s some sort of unpredicted total solar eclipse! Not even my royal astronomer saw this coming!”
Mary switched on the Starfrit’s flashlight, which she usually only used for convenient nighttime cooking.
“What do you mean ‘your’ royal astronomer?” She asked. She pointed the flashlight towards him, then towards his arm, and down to wear his hand still held hers. She felt a rush of something she had not felt in some time, not since Eric.
But then, the sun came back. Mary turned the light off and set the Starfrit down. Collin quickly stood. “I’ve just realized something, something very important,” he said. “Blast, I have so much bloody work. I must be retreating, but perhaps we could meet later? For another ale?”
Mary nodded. Collin named a bar–a dingy sports bar on the East Side–and a time. With that, he was gone. When Mary went to pack up, she couldn’t find her Starfrit anywhere. Which was a shame, as its scraper feature certainly would’ve helped her to clean her grill.

Mary waited at the bar, nursing her beer. The televisions were all turned to the baseball game, with the sound way up. Occasionally, a promo for the evening news promised coverage of Prince Nigel’s visit as well as the strange lunar happening of the afternoon.
“Who cares,” Mary mumbled to herself. Collin was late. Of course he was! He probably wasn’t coming. Another near-miss with love, she thought.
Just then, the feed cut out from the baseball game. “We interrupt this broadcast to bring you, a statement from Prince Nigel the Third.”
There he stood, the man in the strange mask. Mary laughed. He looked so silly. Then he spoke.
“Good morrow, our friends from across the pond,” he said.
Mary felt herself go rigid. She recognized that voice! But no, it couldn’t be. Could it?
“Collin?” she said, as if he could answer her through the television.
“It has been lovely visiting your many museums and areas of historical importance,” the prince went on. “But it was none of them that taught me the most. It was a single person–a single woman–who showed me the true American character, one that is not afraid of multiplicity.” He held up the Starfrit; Mary’s breath caught. “I’ve learned that, like this tool, Americans can do great things, many different great things, and are not as easily categorizable as they seem. And like this tool, they can do wonders at a grill.”
The crowd broke out in laughter in applause. Cameras flashed.
“Now, I may have more to say on this later. But right now, I must be going. I need to return this to its rightful owner. I fear I may even be late!” Just as quickly as the address had begun, it was over. The baseball game returned.
“Anyone sitting here?” a woman said to Mary, indicating the seat next to her at a bar.
Mary smiled. “Yes,” she said. “Or I should say, he’s on his way here now.”"	0.07			2018-08-25T04:00:01.567Z	0.3806925754768836	0.9	53347	0.020357891736731745

When you see an 8-piece cookware set like this–which is really a 4-piece cookware set with a lid for each item–there’s likely an image that comes to mind.
You see yourself standing at the stove, each of the four burners occupied by one of the pots or pans. Perhaps a sauce simmers in one and water comes to a boil in another for pasta that you rolled yourself. You’re sautéing some garlic and onions in yet another, and not with a spatula; instead, with just a flick of your wrist you are cycling it through the air like they do in cooking shows. In the final pan, you brown your steaks before moving them to the oven, where they will cook to a perfect medium rare.
But this image is a fantasy. You can’t actually manage cooking four precise things at once. Honestly, if your stove had only one or two burners, it would work just fine. It might free up some counter space for dealing with the onions you forgot to mince until after your butter had already melted (and burned) in the frying pan.
Thus, purchasing four pots and pans all at once is not necessary, but it is aspirational. You need to keep the dream alive, of wowing your friends and family members with perfectly balanced 4-part meals that make use of descriptors like “deconstructed” or “molecular” or “done three ways.” To have only one pan or one pot would be to admit defeat, to shut the door on your glorious dreams.
In the meantime, great news: you can make your signature “pasta a la butter and a handful of shredded cheese” in one of these just fine! And if you want to make the same thing tomorrow, even more great news: you don’t even need to do the dishes because you’ve got three other cooking vessels just waiting for a turn!"	0.05			2018-08-24T04:00:01.907Z	0.23620242900706845	0.93	59918

In school, you only wore your backpack on one shoulder. When that shoulder started to feel sore from carrying your entire load of books, you shifted it to the other shoulder. This should’ve been all the proof you need: that the most efficient way to wear a backpack is by using both arm straps. So why didn’t you? Because it didn’t look as cool and nonchalant as the single strap technique.
There are more examples: pocket protectors are nerd-wear, despite serving what is actually a pretty useful function. And for all the work automobile manufactures put into building incredibly efficient engines, for a while it seemed like they couldn’t design a hybrid that didn’t look like some sort of weird robo-ladybug.

Whoa. Got a bit deep there.

Dearest Anthony,
It is with a heavy heart that I compose this letter. When you return from your stint with the touring company, you will find me gone, and while we will always be brothers, I will no longer be welcome in our family’s house.
As you might suspect, father discovered my designs. He left for the park to perform his troupe. It was a production of Twelfth Knight, and while he had mentioned that it had been adapted for sock puppets, he made no indication that such modifications involved a shortening of runtime. Thus, I thought I would have nearly three hours of uninterrupted work time. When he arrived home just forty-five minutes later, he found me hard at work on my makeshift drawing table.
Now, I know what you are thinking: why did I not simply lie? You instructed me to do just that when I first confided in you about the designs. But Anthony, I have been lying all my life. I attended L’Academie Royale De L’Art Textile to study sock puppeteering at the age of fifteen. The instructors told me I could emote more with my wrists and palms than most classically trained thespians could with the whole of their bodies. I graduated at the top of my class and received invitations from several of the most renowned touring companies. I traveled the globe. By the age of seventeen, I had performed for two kings and six queens. But it was never what I wanted. I didn’t want to be a sock puppeteer like father and like all of our uncles, like grandfather before them, like you.
And I told father so. When he found me at my drawing table and asked what it was I was scribbling, I confessed everything: that the pretense under which I had returned home–to found my own sock puppet theater–was untrue; that I wanted no longer to act with socks but make my own socks, socks that, in their design alone, possessed as much vibrant life as could be instilled by a skilled sock puppeteer.
Father did not appreciate this, of course. He scoffed at my plans. He told me that out there, beyond the cardboard walls of a sock puppet theater, socks were not lauded but ridiculed. He said there was no such thing as a vibrant life-affirming sock out there. He said they were simple and drab, a mere treaty between foot and shoe.
Moreover, he said I have two options: I must either cast my designs into the fireplace and resume my pursuit of sock puppetry, or forever be banished from his house. As the opening this letter has surely confirmed, I have chosen the latter. I will be traveling far away from here, all the way to the Americas.
So, fare thee well, brother. While it is unlikely that our paths will cross again, perhaps someday you will be in clothing store and you will see a brand of exciting colorful socks with my name upon them and know I have lived my dream.
Yours,
Ezekiel"	0.05			2018-08-22T04:00:07.337Z	0.3287164649283502	0.94	61717			0.03937749319454194	0.07019466178157474

Today’s Order/Hoarder product:
WWE TeenyMates!!!
What we’ve got here are some little mystery grab-bags containing cute-ified versions of your favorite (or least favorite) WWE wrestlers. As with each of these Order/Hoarder sales, we like to provide a little math breakdown: for $5, you can get 8 packs of them, which comes out to 63 cents each. On the other hand, you could get 64 packs for just $20. That’s 31 cents each, right? WRONG! Since you can only order 8 or 64, the first 8 cost $5, and the last 56 cost $15, which means those last 56 are costing you just about 27 cents each! That’s one quarter and two pennies! And when you consider that each pack contains 2… that’s less than 14 cents per wrestler!
And if you’re like, “why would I need 128 of these things?” here are a few helpful suggestions:


Put a bowl of them at the end of your desk at work, and if anyone asks you why, just say, in as condescending a voice as possible: “It’s healthier to hold a tiny wrestler than it is to eat candy.”


Give them away at your kids’ parties. Do you kids and their like wrestlers? Great! They’ll love these things. Do they not like wrestlers? That’s okay too. They won’t know who any of these people are and you can just call them L’il Fun Buddies or something.


Isn’t it about time your little Christmas village got some extreme new residents?


Glue them to your dashboard and let them intimidate you into being a better driver.


Carry them around with you and conduct a social experiment called: how many random people on the street will catch a little wrestler when you say to them: hey you, catch this little wrestler?


You do realize it’s only 71 days till Halloween, right?

Let’s just get right to the basic question here: what is so damn smart about these Smart Stands?
“Smart” has come to be synonymous with “online” or “connected to wifi.” But these Smart Stands are neither. They are an amalgamation of plastic and hinge. There is no voice control or app so you can manage it while you’re on vacation or built-in analytics to tell you how you might best use it in the future, based on your past trends. They just sit there and holds up your tablet or phone.
And maybe in that way they’re the smartest of “smart” products: because they’re smart enough to know what they do well, and also to know what they don’t need to do.
The past is a veritable web of failed innovations. Just like no one wanted pasta from Panera or personal pizzas from Subway, nobody’s pining for some bullshit half-functional beta-level technology to do something that was already extremely simple. Being “smart” is not just creating new complicated functions to prove you can; it’s pausing before you do all the work and asking, “Wait, why are we doing this? Is this actually necessary?”
But you know who didn’t skip that step? Smart Stands. They asked, “Why?” And they said, “Because sometimes you want your tablet to be up like this rather than down like that.” And then they asked, “Should we go further?” And they decided: “No, because the further we go, the more we risk losing our greatest asset, which is that our stands are universally compatible with all phones and tablets.”
See, sometimes intelligence is knowing when to stop and say, “Good enough for me.” Which is why these smart stands are good enough for you, no matter what kind of device you prefer."	0.07			2018-08-19T04:00:02.021Z	0.46941764127665553	0.94	53660			0.024072699552649

Yes, we mentioned the blender bottles sale from a couple Saturdays ago in yesterday’s write-up, but we were mostly talking about the bottles themselves. Today, we’d like to talk about the sale.
See, that sale was an experiment. We offered two choices: a rational number of bottles (the 4-pack) for a good price; or an irrational number of bottles (the 16-pack) for an even better price, with no middle ground. We wanted to know, could we bait you into making a totally ridiculous purchase just by making you feel like you’d gotten a ‘great deal’?
The answer, in a fair number of cases, was ‘yes!’ And so here we are again.
Now, before we get to the product, we need to name this as-of-today recurring sale type. Some ideas:
The Excess Express: Because like an express train, there are few stops between where you should go and the end of the line!
DTB: Does it stand for “Down to buy”? Nope! It’s “Direct to Basement.” Because you don’t need to pretend you’re actually going to use all this stuff! Take one out, deposit the rest downstairs with all the other stuff you thought was a good investment!
Any or Many: Pretty self-explanatory. Other option, along these lines: “More or Less.” Other other option, along these lines: “Deal or Mo’ Deal.”
Irrational Numbers: Are these deals really that much like the mathematical concept of irrational numbers? Yes–because the logic of either is hard to explain–but also no–because only one of them will make you feel smart.
(Also, hello nerds, who are right now gearing up to compose some long screed in the comments about how, well, actually, it’s not that difficult at all to explain irrational numbers!)
Anyway, you can vote on those on today’s poll (and give your own suggestions). Who knows! Maybe if this works, we’ll have a whole spin-off site where do only this kind of deal! Eh?!
As for today’s product, here’s some info: they’re power banks, so it’s not exactly as impractical to have a bunch of them as it was with the blender bottles. Also, we sold something that looks like these before, with the shoe sole pattern, but these are the 6000mAh version, whereas last time they were 9000mAh. On the plus side: that means they’re smaller. On the downside: that means they have less charging capacity (each one can carry enough power to charge the average phone about 3 full times, rather than 4 with the other version).
But really, what’s important is THE DEAL! Because think about: at 2 for $12, that’s $6 per power bank. Not a bad price at all. BUT if you opt for 10, and assume that the first 2 cost $6 each, that means the last 8 cost just $24, or a mere $3 each! And if you go deeper and consider that each of those 8 is rated at 6,000 milliamp hours, that means that you’re only paying $0.0005 per mAh! And $0.0005 is basically nothing, and a lot of nothing is still nothing, therefore, WE’RE PRETTY MUCH GIVING THESE THINGS AWAY!
Okay, maybe we kind of flubbed up the logic there. But the question remains: do you want a boring old 2-pack of Xsories 6000mAh Power Banks for $12 or an amazing 10 for $36?!"	0.07			2018-08-18T04:00:05.333Z	0.3572084668612603	0.93	53049			0.024494294870486415

You probably saw the word “blender” and the word “bottle” and thought, why do I need this thing when I just received my 4 or 16 pack of blender bottles? But the products are actually very different. For example, the blender bottles we sold before were both blenders and bottles, whereas this is a blender that comes with two vessels for blending that are themselves bottles.
Or, to put it differently:
The blender bottles are bottles that can blend things inside the bottle, whereas this is a blender that blend things inside one of the two bottles that come with it (or more than two, if you order more than one blender, in which case, you simply need to multiply the number of blenders you order by two to ascertain the number of bottles, which again, are not blender bottles, but bottles that work with this blender).
But here’s the thing: even if you ordered the blender bottles, you can still order this blender and bottles, because the blender and the blender bottles (not to be confused with the bottles that come with the blender) can be used together (although, obviously, the blender and the bottles it comes with can be used together too). See, blender bottles we sold a couple weeks ago, having only a small metal ball rather than a blade or a motor (like this blender has), aren’t really great at being blenders, but they are good at whisking things (so maybe they should be called ‘whisker bottles,’ although on second thought, maybe not, as that sounds like something altogether different and unappealing).
Point is, you could use the blender–this one, the one with a motor and a blade–for more intense blending jobs, like making a fruit smoothie. Then, you can pour the smoothie from the blender’s blending bottle into a blender bottle and take it with you wherever you’re going, so that you can whisk it back together if it settles.
What we’re saying is that what you should really do is buy this blender and two bottles and then pour the things you make in the blender’s bottles into one of your blender bottles, while using the bottles that come with the blender just for the initial blending.
Unless you didn’t buy the blender bottles. In which case, disregard the above."	0.05			2018-08-17T04:00:10.364Z	0.30912710887561573	0.94	60832

Well, this is a first from our branded content romance novel collection: a teenaged paranormal love story! Please enjoy these excerpts of The Heart Races Until It Rests by Annborny Hilledale.

Ellie met Henri while running.
She was not looking for love. When she’d quit the cheerleading squad to join cross-country, her boyfriend Brad, the quarterback of the school’s football team, dumped her because her running gear didn’t look “as hot.” She was relieved more than anything. She was a senior and she had decisions to make: did she want to go to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Oxford, or one of the other ivy league schools she’d gotten into?
Really, Ellie wanted to got to a small liberal arts school and study poetry, but it wasn’t up to her. Both her mother and her father were founders and CEOs of very powerful companies, and they’d both fought so much about whose company Ellie would eventually take over that they’d gotten a divorce. The only thing they could agree on anymore: Ellie had to study business.
Her Polar Heart Rate Monitor beeped helpfully to let her know her heart rate had risen above her optimal zone. Ellie often ran too fast when she got anxious about the future.
She slowed down, which was when the boy appeared at her side. ‘Appeared’ because Ellie hadn’t seen him approach. “Good day!” he said with a smile. He looked about her age but also–Ellie couldn’t exactly describe it–almost sepia-toned? He wore a strange antiquated cotton shirt and cotton shorts and his shoes appeared old-fashioned, with almost no support. “The name is Henri. I’ve just begun to undertake the task of what I’ve heard referred to as ‘cardiovascular activity’ and I was wondering if you might allow me to accompany you!”
Ellie looked at her Polar Heart Rate Monitor again. Its easy-to-read screen let her know that she’d reached her workout goal for the day. “Sorry. I’m actually just wrapping up.”
Henri looked at his shoes, disappointed. “I understand,” he said.
“But tomorrow,” Ellie heard herself say. She didn’t know why. There was something interesting about him. “I’ll pick you up at your house and we’ll go for a jog. Where do you live?”
“Just past 229 Healy Street.” Something seemed to occur to Henri. “But upon a secondary thought, t’wouldst it be possible to meet right here?”
Ellie agreed. The plan was set.

For all his grandstanding about not understanding ‘cardiovascular activity’ Henri never seemed to get tired. They talked the whole way about classic poetry. Henri was very familiar and spoke about the poets in a funny way. Like with his look, Ellie couldn’t exactly place the strangeness of his tone except to say it seemed that he often spoke as if he knew the poets personally. She chalked it up to an affect, of which Henri had plenty!
“What is that strange jewelry you wear?” he asked at one point.
“This? It’s my Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Its convenient display makes it easy to track my total calories burned per session as well as provide a weekly training summary.”
“Is it expressly designed for this very activity?”
“Nope! It’s great for biking, circuit training, or even just walking. Here do you want to try it on?”
“Oh, that’s not necessary–” Henri started to say, but Ellie had already stopped and slipped it off her wrist. Had this all been a ploy to take his exceedingly pale wrist into her hand? Did she have a growing desire to touch him? Perhaps, but Henri seemed uncomfortable, and they ran the rest of the way in silence.
Later, when she uploaded the data easily to her free profile at polarpersonaltrainer.com by way of her Polar Flowlink, she noticed something odd. The data for her run was there, but around the time she put the watch on Henri, all heart rate readings went blank.
“Huh,” she said. “Must be an issue with the monitor.” But her Polar Heart Rate Monitor had always worked flawlessly before…

It kept happening. Each day, the Polar would continuously display her own heart rate, and when Henri would wear it for the second half of their run–something Ellie insisted on, as a means of testing its functionality–there would be no reading.
But she didn’t know how to tell him something was wrong. Just as they managed to remain in the optimal zone for burning fat thanks to the Heart Rate Monitor, so too did it feel as if they were always in the optimal zone for conversation. She could tell Henri anything and he seemed to understand: about her parents, about her college decision, or about her day at school (from which he was conspicuously absent).
Finally, one day she couldn’t help it.
“Henri,” she said. “I need to tell you something. I’m in love with you.”
“And I need to tell you something,” Henri said. “Ellie, I’m a ghost. The ghost of Henri Olson, a long forgotten poet who died in his teens.”
Ellie should’ve been surprised, but somehow she wasn’t. “So that’s why your heart rate never showed up.”
“Alas!” he cried. “But if it could, it would read a number so high, as just the sight of you sets me aflutter! You see, I have unfinished business, Ellie. I have never felt love.”
“Never?”
“You must understand: it was a different time when I was born. We weren’t worried about heart rates. If we could have such a glorious device as that Polar when I was growing up, it would not measure calories but risk of scarlet fever. In such a dangerous time, can one ever feel true love? I say no, despite writing so many poems about it. But with you Ellie, well I’ve been trying to deny it. To admit so much would be to finish my unfinished business…”
“Just kiss me,” Ellie said. She leaned forward with her eyes closed and their lips met. She tasted no salty sweat on his lips, despite that the Polar Heart Rate Monitor said they’d really been pushing themselves. But of course she wouldn’t. Ghosts didn’t sweat, not even beautiful ones.
In the moment before she could open her eyes, Henri whispered: “Ellie, I love you.”
Ellie found herself alone on the road.

The dean of the English department at the small idyllic Halpern College ushered Ellie into his office. She didn’t wear her Polar Heart Rate Monitor because she was afraid her rapid nervous heartbeat would set off an alarm.
“It’s quite unusual,” the dean said, “for a freshman to win our annual award for gothic poetry, but the imagery you’ve presented–of the final kiss, of riding your bike past his supposed address and finding a graveyard, all of it–it’s just so lovely. Such a wonderful imagination.”
“You could call it that,” Ellie said.
“So I’m pleased to say, as your reward, we will purchase any book for the library in your name. Now, don’t be afraid to take some time to think it over–”
“The Collected Works of Henri Olson.”
The dean cocked his head to the side. “I don’t think I’ve heard of him?”
“He died very young,” Ellie said, pretending to rub her eye to wipe away a tear. “But he–I mean, his poems–they were really quite lovely.”"	0.05			2018-08-16T04:00:03.517Z	0.23418002803322968	0.94	61944

Friends, before reading further, lock your doors, turn on all of the lights, and gather your pets and loved ones tight, because the following is a horror story.
We begin with a young man. Let us give him a name. Let us call him Sean.
This all happened some years ago, when Sean was just a naive young man who believed, due to being brought up in the Northeast within proximity to a certain corporate food chain, that donut shops could be relied upon for iced coffee. It was this misunderstanding that will ultimately lead to our story’s tragic end. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Sean, walking the streets of Seattle on a hot summer afternoon, entered a donut shop–not one of the fancy ones you may have heard of; a small, out-of-the-way place that will remain nameless–and asked the man behind the counter, “Do you have iced coffee?”
The man replied, “Yes, we have iced coffee.” Or no, that’s not it. That’s not it at all. What he said was: “Yes, I can do iced coffee.”
This should’ve been the tell, the sign that something was amiss and Sean should flee that donut shop. But he ignored the portents. He removed a small bill and said, “Great, I’ll have an iced coffee then.”
What happened next is almost too gruesome to put into words.
Almost.
The man behind the counter took a large styrofoam cup, filled it with ice, and proceeded to pour hot coffee from the pot directly over it, handing Sean, to his horror, a lukewarm watery mess.
But do not grieve for Sean. Do not shed one single tear over his ruined attempt to seek cold caffeination. For Sean is a complex protagonist, and he is not without blame here.
Because why was he even seeking to purchase an iced coffee in the first place? Why was he not buying beans in bulk and then using this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Bundle to make his own deliciously smooth and delightfully cheap iced coffee at home? Perhaps, if he had, the day before, loaded up the 1.6 qt. cold brew carafe–or the bottle, which he could’ve carried with him–he might have avoided such a cruel fate.
As is the case with many stories of terror and woe, this is a cautionary tale. Do not, dear reader, make the same mistake Sean made. Buy this bundle and live forever in cold coffee bliss."	0.05			2018-08-15T04:00:09.341Z	0.31881841989687204	0.93	65238

It’s about halfway down the feature bullets to these Medical Forehead and Ear Digital Thermometers that you see this:

“JUST ONE BUTTON to press. No more fear of breaking a glass or swallowing mercury.”

And you’re reminded that there was a time when, in the name of health, we put a glass tube of an extremely dangerous chemical into the mouths of children.
Children.
Children who might heave their favorite toy across the room just to see if it can fly. Children who eat the erasers on the end of a #2 pencil because it looks like gum. They were given a tube made of glass–the most satisfying of all smashables–filled with a weird, perhaps even delicious-looking, red substance.
Kids these days have it easy.
Or do they?
My mom, a nurse, always had a cupboard in the bathroom stocked with the most up-to-date medical paraphernalia. Therefore, we had a digital thermometer from the beginning. It was nice. Like this one, no mercury. Like this one, an easy straightforward digital readout of your temperature. Unlike this one, it took what felt like a half-hour to give a final verdict on whether or not you’d reached that magical realm north of 98.6 and earned the day off from school. And so, it wasn’t uncommon for the temperature-taker to put the thermometer in the child’s mouth and then walk away to take care of something else, allowing the child freedom to manipulate, through a variety of means, the final result.
This is hypothetical, of course. I would never have done such a thing.
(Oh, and also, just an FYI: that whole 98.6 being the average human temperature thing is the result of tests conducted by one doctor using a crummy armpit thermometer in the 19th century and is mostly bullshit.)
These thermometers, meanwhile, can register a temperature in seconds from the mouth or the forehead, thus disallowing for any alteration of results.

On day one, we sold a Roomba. That was in July, 2014. In the last 5 months of that year–our first 5 months of operation–we sold 5 more Roombas. We sold one or two in 2015. Since then, nothing. No more Roombas…

What’s the best metaphor to capture the excitement of our reunification? Perhaps we could think of ourselves as a once famous rock band who amicably splintered to pursue our solo careers. We would certainly be the experimental-minded keyboardist, doing avant-guard work with help of speaker docks and vacuum sealers, whereas the Roomba would be the pop-forward frontman, producing hit after hit, each one more-or-less the same.
And now comes our glorious reunion tour!
(Although, now that I think about it, don’t bands usually reunite when the “well has run dry,” so to speak? As in: a last ditch effort to regain their former wealth or reputation?)
How about a different metaphor: in the 2015 we let the Roomba go off to clean, and now, after many years of service to the greater world, it’s made its circuitous way back to Meh, its noble charging port!
Nice pivot, eh?
Anyway, as we implied above, in the time since we last sold a Roomba, there have been, by our estimation, 6,000 new models released, all of which look almost exactly the same. So, if you’re wondering why you should buy this Roomba instead of a different Roomba, we are too.

But it does have a lot of the other things that make those models great, such as a big bin and an AeroForce High Efficiency Filter, meaning the air that passes through it comes out a lot cleaner (which could be a big deal for allergy sufferers).

When the employees arrived at their first day at the new NOTILUS headquarters, they noticed something strange.
“There is no roof,” one of them said.
“Exactly,” said one of the higher-ups. “It’s an open-roof open-office.”
“But we won’t be protected from the rain,” said another employee.
“Exactly,” the higher-up said again.
The building had tile floors and was equipped with a siren. It sounded whenever a storm approached, at which point, the employees took the tarps provided to them and covered their computers, their phones, anything that could succumb to water damage. Then, they stood. They closed their eyes. They waited for the rain to wash over them so that they could understand it, become one with it.
Thus, when they engineered their shower heads to have 6 settings including “Wide Rainfall” and “Power Rain,” they knew these to be the true to their names. And when they built dual-zone antimicrobial jets that did not clog, it was not only to provide their customers with consistently strong water pressure; it was to mimic the rain that, year after year, never ceased to lessen in its strength.

A lot of the stuff we sell can be categorized as zero-to-sale items. You come here thinking, “I don’t need anything,” and you leave with some headphones or a bunch of junky phone accessories or a veritable pile of blender bottles. Additionally, some of the stuff that ends up here requires some explanation: they’re light bulbs that are also bluetooth speakers? What do you mean, “LED Name-tags”? Hold up, how many audiobooks? That sort of thing.
But this ain’t either of those.
Given that it’s the most expensive product we’ve probably ever sold on Meh, it’s definitely not an impulse buy. Unless you’re, like, a billionaire. In which case, a) what exactly are you doing here? And b) can we get a cool 5 mil to launch our new app? Hear us out: It’s like Shazam, but for smells!
Likewise, the concept of it doesn’t need to be explained. “You know how you have eyes? And when you point them at things, you see the things? And how sometimes, there’s a certain angle from which the things look pretty cool? Well, this ingenious contraption allows you to capture those angles so that you can see the things, even when you’re not near the things.”
Seriously, trying to think of how you’d describe a camera to someone who’s never heard of cameras is actually making me more confused about cameras. So I’ll stop trying and just tell you exactly what we’re dealing with here:
This is a nudge buy.
If you’re someone who’s been thinking about getting a DSLR for a while, biding your time and doing the appropriate level of research required of such a significant purchase, you’re our ideal customer today. Because, we’re basically trying to push you that little bit towards finally saying, “you know what? Screw it. Today’s the day!” And in return, you get this really great DSLR camera and a bunch of lenses and accessories for $100 less than you can get it elsewhere.
And btw, if you’re thinking, nah, I’ll just wait until this price drops, or find somewhere selling it for cheaper, we’ve got some bad news for you. Canon stuff basically never goes down in price. We explain why in detail here. Seriously, go read that. It’s very informative, and one of our best write-ups (which I say with only jealousy, because ugh, I didn’t write it, okay?).
So what do you say, shopper teetering on the fence between Rebel T6i admirer and Rebel T6i owner? With this offer, have we given you a thorough enough poke?

The great philosopher Zaza Pachulia once said: “Nothing easy.” He was referring to the 8th seed Atlanta Hawks forcing a game seven against the 1st seed Boston Celtics, but his words are applicable to so many things in life. For us, there is “nothing easy” about balancing our standards for honest copy with our desire to offer a diverse range of products. Some days, it just seems untenable. And friends, today is one of those days. Because if I gave my 100% honest opinion of this ProCabello Straightener and Styler Kit it would be this:
IDK, it looks good to me, I guess.
See, I don’t actually know. I’ve never used a hair straightener, nor can I foresee a scenario arising in the future where I will either. Then again, this isn’t my first rodeo. There’ve been plenty of products I don’t particularly care about, and when they come up, there’s a simple solution: lean on the Amazon reviews.
Unfortunately this doesn’t help me much here, because the reviews, while positive (and that’s despite the significantly higher price point WITHOUT the “Shine and Hold Spray” we’re including), say very little.
For example, here is Diane Camargo’s review in full:

Love it!! The best flat iron I’ve used

And Karen Tucci writes:

Awesome flat iron. Heats up super fast. Has multiple heat settings. Very happy with my purchase.

And Adrian Blake Hammonds writes:

I love the way my hair feels.

Is it good to see such positive reviews of the item we’re selling? Sure. Do these reviews help me, as a copywriter, find an interesting angle for my write-up? No. Did I include three of them when one would suffice simply to push the write-up further down the page, thus making it appear longer? Of course. Unless it’s @Dave asking, in which case, no way! I did it for integrity!
Really the point is, it’s difficult to write about something without any personal attachment to even the concept of it. That’s why so much copy looks like… well… copy. But that’s not what we want. Likewise, we can’t just sell the stuff we know how to write about. We need to sell items that are outside of our comfort zone sometimes. Are they outside of the greater Meh community’s comfort zone, too? Maybe. Only time (and all of the graphs at the bottom of the page) will tell.
In the meantime, if you know a thing or two about hair straighteners, maybe help us out by leaving a few comments. And if you don’t, but you know someone who does, send this along to them.

We’ve got another weird item pedaling vague impossible-to-prove pseudo-science, so that means another installment of THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE: a feature wherein we lay out the product’s claims and explain why we’re not so sure we believe them. Here goes!
The Claim
The Pure Daily Care Diffuser is the “ultimate starter pack for essential oil enthusiasts.” The various botanical oils are “100% pure” and also “100% organic” with “no fillers or additives.” All of this is fairly simple. Where it gets more interesting is in laying out the benefits of each included oil:

Peppermint is a “mental stimulant” that “provides energy”;
Orange is a “respiratory stimulator, antiseptic, antidepressant, aphrodisiac, and neural stimulator”;
Tea Tree is a “powerful immune stimulator”;
Lemongrass is “neural stimulator” that “soothes aches and pains while also reducing anxiety”;
Lavender is another “neural stimulator” that “reduces stress and anxiety and promotes restful sleep”;
and Eucalyptus is a “respiratory booster” and is “great for relieving sinus congestions.”

The Skepticism
Perhaps I shouldn’t call myself skeptical here. I’m not skeptical. I think this is bullshit, and moreover, I think it’s pretty dangerous. Not the diffuser itself, but the language.
Because eucalyptus oil will not relieve sinus congestion in a meaningful way. And lemongrass oil isn’t going to help with your sore joints. And orange oil is as much an antidepressant as the two day old styrofoam tub that held raw chicken in the trash is a depressant. By which I mean: walking into a house that smells bad sucks, and therefore will make you feel unhappy; so, conversely, walking into a house that smells good doesn’t suck, thus making you happy by contrast.
This is all to say that if you have sinus issues, or joint pain, or depression, don’t just buy a diffuser. See a doctor.
But again, this is an issue of language, specifically language that makes empty promises. The actual truth is essential oil diffusers are great. They don’t smell as fake and chemical-y as plug-ins. They’re not smokey like incense. It’s kinda cool to watch the mist rise out of them. And this one has 7 neat ambient light settings.
That’s why my wife and I are buying one: not for any medical reasons, but because we just moved into a new house and we want it to smell okay. Even when I forget to take out the trash…
In Conclusion
Diffusers are actually pretty nice, as long as what you’re looking for is a good smell, and not a cure."	0.05			2018-08-08T04:00:06.259Z	0.21768616353254416	0.94	62973

It’s been a while since we’ve been able to dip into our library of branded content romance novels, but luckily, we found one that just happens to involve today’s product. Get ready for a tale of desire and medical emergencies in these excerpts from Gene Harmony’s Love Is A Medicine Best Served At The Appropriate Temperature(s).

People were always asking Dale to open jars because of his amazingly strong arms. And people were also always asking why, when he could so easily be a model, he chose to work at the front desk of a pharmaceuticals lab. “Not everyone wants to be on the runway,” he’d say with a smile of clean white teeth that reinforced his model-like qualities. The real answer, though, was that he’d always had the desire to save lives. Working here, where so many important medications were developed, was the closest he could get.
Dale wasn’t the only one in the lab whose good looks were surprising. Rumor had it that Dr. Liza modeled to pay her way through graduate school on the way to becoming the world’s foremost expert on life-saving drugs. Whether that was true or not, Dale had to admit: she was beautiful. Even now, as she rushed up to the desk in her lab coat, clearly flustered, she looked exquisite.
Dale thought maybe she was coming to flirt, something that happened often, though nothing ever came of it. She was a lauded scientist, after all, and he a lowly receptionist. But flirting was not on the agenda today.
“Can I ask a big favor?” she said. “No one else is available to help and there’s a patient in need of an experimental medication. We have to get to the hospital, so it can be safely administered. Could you give me a ride?”
“No problem,” Dale said, standing.
“But there is a problem,” Dr. Liza said. “It’s a complicated medication, comprised of three very volatile liquids that cannot be combined until the last possible minute before being administered. Also, each substance must be kept within a certain temperature range. If I leave them in their test-tubes, they’ll grow too warm or too cold on the ride over.”
“I have just the thing,” Dale said.

Dale and Dr. Liza carried the four Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs out to his car: three filled with temperature controlled substances, one extra, “Just in case,” Dr. Liza had said.
“We need to be careful with these,” she said now, but it was not an issue at all, given that the Primulas’ contemporary attractive twist-textured design allowed for a secure grip. Not to mention they were splash-resistant! “And you’re sure they’re not contaminated?”
“Absolutely,” said Dale. “It’s very easy to clean the mugs themselves. And I put the lids through my dishwasher at home, on the top rack, where it’s safe for them to go.”
Dale could tell that Dr. Liza, though still nervous, was happy to hear this. And she was even happier when she saw that all four mugs fit into the various front- and back-seat cup-holders of Dale’s modest hatchback. “Like a glove,” she murmured to herself. “Maybe I’ll be okay after all.”
“What’s that?” Dale said.
But Dr. Liza didn’t repeat herself.

They’d left the lab an hour ago. The hospital was only five miles away. Yet, they found themselves only halfway there, stuck in unmoving bumper-to-bumper traffic. The reprieve in Dr. Liza’s anxiety, brought on by the various positive aspects of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs, proved temporary. Out of the corner of his eye, Dale had watched her grow more and more upset–first sitting straight up, then tapping her fingers on the dash and sighing loudly.
When she finally spoke, her voice cracked with fear. “It’s no use. We’re getting nowhere. We need to administer the medication now.”
“But how are we going to do that?” Dale said. “The patient is at the hospital.”
“No, I said we need to go to the hospital so they can administer it safely. The patient isn’t there. Not yet. She’s here. Dale, it’s me.”
“What?!”
“Look at me, Dale,” Dr. Liza said. “You’re going to have to administer the drug that’ll save my life from the disease I’ve kept a secret all these months.”
“But, but…”
“There are no buts about it,” Dr. Liza said. She pointed to one of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs. “See that Primula 20oz Insulated Mug? You told me that–with its double walls, vacuum seal, and triple-layer Copper Cold Technology–it can keep liquids hot for up to 8 hours and cool for 24. It makes sense that you’d have such a mug, because you’re a lot like it. You want to save lives. I’ve seen it in your eyes, and like a giant beautiful man-shaped Primula 20oz Insulated Mug, you keep that desire at the appropriate temperature so that it never dies.”
Dale nodded. She was right. He’d waited his whole life for this. Without a word, he got the empty Primula and carefully mixed the contents from the others together in it. “Now, what do I do?”
“It needs to be applied to my lips,” Dr. Liza said. “But first, it requires vermilion stabilization, meaning it must be applied to a healthy pair of lips, and then transferred from those lips to the taker’s.”
Dale understood what he must do. He gravely opened the easy-open, easy-close lid. It was straw-compatible but he didn’t need one now. He let the liquid touch his lips, and then he leaned over the center console to Dr. Liza…

Dale paced. He held a Primula 20oz Insulated Mug. He had cleaned it and filled it with coffee from the hospital waiting room two hours ago when he arrived, and it was still hot.
Finally, the doctor appeared. “She’s recovering,” he said, “thanks to that experimental drug she made and thanks to your administering of it. Still, to be safe, we’ll give her regular doses of it every four hours.”
“And how will you give it to her?” Dale said, feeling strangely jealous. “Do you have a machine for vermilion stabilization?”
The doctor looked at him, confused.
“You know,” Dale said. “It needs to be applied from healthy lips to the lips of the diseased.”
“It’s taken orally, son,” the doctor said. Then a sly grin came across his face. “If I had to wager a guess, I’d say someone has a crush on you!”"	0.05			2018-08-07T04:00:06.333Z	0.5387061168679262	0.92	64187			0.11531935223472428

“Do not cast your pearls before swine.”
People spoke these words without thinking, for a moment, of how they would hurt me, a pig. But more than speak them, they lived by them. Every time I walked into a jewelry store, they quickly rushed to put away their finest pearls.
I told them, “But it is me. I am not a descendent of some clown like Porky. My grandfather built the first ever wolf-proof house. He patented his  special structurally-sound brick-laying technique, and it has been used in the constructions of homes the country over, including three governors’ mansions. He passed his business down to my father who passed it down to me, and now, my net worth is somewhere in the high nine-figures. So please, allow me to purchase the great jewels of the sea.”
Still, I received nothing.
Then, one day, I saw a New Yorker cartoon. One dog sat on the floor, listening to another, seated at a computer. The caption read: “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” For many, it was simply humorous. For me, it was instructive. I realized this was the easiest way to pearl ownership: the internet.
Since then, I’ve made a point to purchase all pearl and mother of pearl jewelry I see for sale online. Truthfully, I don’t even like pearls that much, but I buy them anyway, just to enjoy the warm feeling of a symbolic victory.

You get 2 pairs of Maroo ICE Headphones, but when you receive them, you might think you accidentally ordered 8. Because despite their “smaller fit for women’s ears,” these things come in an unnecessarily big and complicated box. User @Chakolate sums it up pretty nicely:

What is a problem is the amount of packaging. The unopened package is 223 grams, of which 11 grams are the actual headphones. They come in a jewelry-type velvet box, which is nestled in a lot of plastic, which is inside a thin cardboard box, which is wrapped in tissue paper. They also include a carry pouch, and a thick little book about how to use them. (Seriously? They’re kidding, right?) The end package is about 8x3x3"", which is absurd for headphones.

And in case you need some idea of how big that actually is, here’s a picture.

For context, the can next to it is 16 ounces. It’s also a delicious hazy New England style IPA as good as any I had back east from the best brewery in Des Moines! (In case anyone from Confluence is reading and wants to give me some swag.)
Now, you’re probably thinking: “All that stuff for some bedazzled earbuds? What a waste!” But you’re not looking at the big picture. All the various packaging materials are not simply for this product; they’re for a bunch of different things we’ve sold over the course of the last year. For example:


You can cut up the plastic casing and put them in your Ray Ban Eyeglasses when one of the lenses breaks.


You can use the jewelry case to hold your Diamond Encrusted Eternal Heart-Shaped Pearl earrings.


You can use the pouches for safe transport of your WWE TeenyMates.


And you can use the tissue paper when you move to wrap the little espresso cups you got to go along with your Nespresso Vertuo.

Four Blender Bottles probably seems like plenty of Blender Bottles. You have your Blender Bottle, your backup Blender Bottle, a Blender Bottle to try weird stuff in, and a Blender Bottle to give away when your friend is like, “Oh, I should get a Blender Bottle like that.”
Sixteen Blender Bottles is probably too many Blender Bottles. Even if you’re very clumsy with your Blender Bottles, or very experimental, or have a lot of friends who want Blender Bottles, you’re still probably going to end up with a few leftover Blender Bottles.
So why should you get sixteen Blender Bottles?
Because it’s possible that this is the best ever deal on Blender Bottles. You’re probably thinking: sixteen Blender Bottles for $49? That’s about $3 per Blender Bottle. Not bad, right? But it gets even better, because really, if four Blender Bottles costs $20, that means you’re really getting twelve Blender Bottles at $29. So you’re looking at a cost of less than $2.50 per Blender Bottle after the initial four Blender Bottles.
(Which, side note, makes for a great conversation starter. The next time you have some friends over just point to the pile of Blender Bottles in the corner–and there will be a pile of them in the corner; you have sixteen of them, after all–and say, “See that Blender Bottle? That Blender Bottle only cost me $2.42.” Just, make sure you point to one of the last twelve Blender Bottles, not one of the first four Blender Bottles, because as we’ve established, those Blender Bottles cost more.)
With savings like that, can you really pass up buying sixteen Blender Bottles?

The FoodSaver conference room was tense. Nobody knew why the emergency meeting had been called except that it involved “a failure in marketing.”
Finally, Richard, the sixty year old exec who’d sent out the invite, arrived.
“Folks, we’ve got problems,” he said. “Our prized product, the Vacuum Sealing System, is being used for things other than saving food. Which is bad, because that’s our name. One thing they’re using it for is something called ‘Sous vide,’ which I believe is a religion, so we’ll want to be very careful there. But the other thing is–” Richard looked around, and spoke in a hushed tone–“they’re using it for marijuana.”
“They smoke through the machine?” asked Terry, age fifty-two.
“That’s what I thought at first,” Richard said. “But it turns out it’s more for storage and keeping it fresh. Anyway, there’s a whole bunch of people doing it. I found a message board where everyone was snap-chatting about it. The Red Edit.”
“It’s called Reddit,” said the intern, age twenty-one. “It’s the ‘trees’ subreddit.”
“Nope, that’s not it,” said Richard. “It’s definitely not about trees. Your generation wouldn’t understand because your Woodstocks were different. Anyway, we need to cash in on this, and we need to cash in on this NOW. We need a marketing campaign. Something to appeal to the youth.”
“But you just said my generation–”
“Quiet, intern. The adults are talking. Now, let’s spitball a little. What do we got?”
“What if,” said Tony, age fifty-eight, “we do one of those internet pictures and then make it go viral?”
“I like that,” Richard said. “That’s a good plan: a viral internet picture.”
“I’ve seen one particular internet picture,” said Harry, age fifty-eight, “where there’s a man pointing at a butterfly. The man will be labeled, and the butterfly will be labeled, but the man will be saying, ‘Is this a something-other-than-butterfly?’”
“Because it’s labeled as something else,” Richard said.
“No,” said Harry. “I should’ve mentioned that too. He doesn’t call it what it’s labeled, either. He calls it something else. I believe that’s part of the joke.”
“Okay, so,” said Terry, “we label the butterfly ‘FoodSaver’ and the man as ‘consumer’ and he’s asking: ‘Is this a thing for storing my reefer?’”
“Ganja,” said Tony. “Let’s say ‘ganja.’”
“Good catch,” said Richard. “We need to use relevant terms.”
“Also, underneath the question,” said Harry, “it should say, ‘Yes, and you can has it!’”
“That’s with the cat, right?” Richard said.
“No,” Terry said. “Cat says, ‘hang in there.’”
“Well, this has been very productive,” said Richard. “Good work, team. I’ll send this along to the design department. I’ll tell them to redraw the image in case there’s a copyright issue and to get us twelve potential samples by this afternoon.”
“You want the design department to make twelve images in a few hours?” asked the intern.
“Yes,” said Richard.
“But how?”
“They have computers,” Richard said. “It’s easy. And anyway, I don’t tell them how to do their jobs. Until I do. Now, intern, didn’t I put you on a special office sustainability project? I thought you kids love that stuff.”
“You asked me to photocopy a blank piece of paper as a way of saving paper,” said the intern, “but that doesn’t actually make any sense.”
“Look, do you want the college credit or not?”

But already, we’ve messed up. All this talk of “you can get” and “if you want”? Are we crazy? If you’re buying heart pendants online in mid-November, you’re probably not thinking about yourself. You’re buying holiday gifts for others.
But who? Yes, there are plenty of people out there who love jewelry, but these days the gift-giving season (at least in our experience) seems to be less about personal affects and more about technological advancement. You don’t get your mom earrings anymore; you get her a tablet. And you don’t get your grandmother a bracelet; you order her a Roku and help set up Netflix so she can watch her shows on an infinite loop without commercial interruption. So who are you buying this jewelry for?
You might not be able to think of anyone… and that’s exactly the point!
You’re forgetting somebody. Or maybe you’re not. Maybe you didn’t even realize Aunt Gilma was coming this year, after what happened at the Easter Parade. Or maybe you didn’t know Cousin Nick was bringing his girlfriend from college, or that he had a girlfriend at all, or that he was in college, and actually the more you think about it, the less you remember even having a cousin Nick. But that doesn’t matter. She’ll be there for the holidays, and come Christmas morning you don’t want her to have to sit awkwardly on the floor among the landscape of shredded wrapping paper with a big pile of nothing to bring home.
And jewelry is the perfect gift in this situation: a nice, attractive, inoffensive, break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option for that special someone in your life… that you totally spaced on.
In other words, it wouldn’t hurt to just have some around this time of year.
And if you give the pendant to someone who doesn’t like it? Guess what: there’s probably another person coming around for their holiday celebration that they didn’t consider. You know what that is?

Yes, with each day there comes fewer hours of sunlight to warm things up. The numbers you saw on the right in the “low” column have begun their migration left, replacing the previously pleasant “high” temperatures. Thus, this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Maker and travel brewers might, you think, only be used a short time before they go into storage. Because brewing iced coffee in December is like the beverage equivalent of wearing shorts during a blizzard: something done, in states that experience a true winter, only by the extremest of die-hards and season deniers.
As one such person, I can confirm: we are a small, proud, devoted (if not somewhat delusional) group. But we also know a secret that few others seem to understand.
Before I get to that, though, let me clarify. The group I’m talking about is those who drink iced coffee year round. I claim not to know anything about the cold-legged shorts wearers. Although I do wear shorts in the winter months sometimes. For example, if I’m stuck inside and doing something active, like cooking or cleaning.
And this is exactly the secret I’m talking about: winter only happens outside!
Everywhere else, it remains warm enough to drink refreshing smooth cold brew. At home. At work. Even in the car. Actually, especially in the car, after you’ve given it some time to warm up, when it becomes basically a mobile sauna.
What’s funny is that this secret hides in plain sight. Think about it. Do you bake your salads in the winter? Do you pour a bottle of Coca Cola into the kettle and set it to boil? Do you say to the bartender, “I’ll have the IPA, but nuke it on high for 45 seconds”? Sure, a hot toddy, a nice soup, or a steaming mug of hot apple cider is nice. but even in February, these things aren’t as ubiquitous as a glass of cold water and a deli sandwich.
In other words, it’s totally easy to normal to drink cold brew coffee year round. The only tough part is when you walk from the warmth of your car to the warmth of your house or your office with your cold cup in hand.

This MOKCAO POWER+ Cordless Speaker is compatible with the 2nd Generation Amazon Echo Dot, which essentially means this is a vessel for Alexa. She’s called a “digital assistant” but it’s around now, in the fall, where she begins to feel entirely digital and of little assistance.
Alexa can’t rake leaves, and she’s terrible with a leaf blower. Ditto for scraping the frost from your car’s windshield.
You can ask her to help bring the potted plants in from the porch, and she’ll refuse each time, regardless of how polite you are. As if she doesn’t understand SHE works for YOU!
Alexa can tell you the Bolivian city Oruro’s population. She can tell you who serves at its mayor, or what kind of climate it experiences. She can probably tell you its exact coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. But she has no fucking clue where you put your damn sweaters after you moved this past summer.
With certain home systems, it’s likely possible that Alexa could adjust your house’s internal temperature and turn on certain lights at your request. But she is powerless to slow the gusts of wind that keep knocking off the dead branches from the trees in your backyard, or halt the encroaching darkness that aims to devour large swaths of your day.

They say variety is the spice of life, but switching up the spices themselves doesn’t make something entirely new. What’s better: trying an entirely new method of cooking. Take sous vide cooking, for example. Using a slow, rotating hot (but not boiling) water bath to cook your food (which itself is sealed inside a plastic bag) will allow for levels of tenderness heretofore unexperienced.
But as with all things culinary, you should know what you’re getting yourself into. So, instead of spending two-grand on some state-of-the-art sous vide oven that you may or may not enjoy using, try one of these. It will work with any pot and is small enough to be stored easily, while also giving you a taste of what sous vide cooking has to offer.
…is what you can say to whoever you give the second one of of your two Power Precision Sous Vide Cookers to. The real truth is: by giving away one of these to a friend or family member you’re actually giving yourself a gift.
Sous vide cooking is fun. It’s weird. It’s a lot different than most basic cooking methods. And because of that, there are tricks you’re bound to pick up along the way, little ways to improve your food’s flavor, or methods that maybe make it just that much easier.
Still, you’re bound to have some blind spots. Cooking is like having a problem to solve, the problem of how to get all these ingredients into a cohesive “meal.” As such, everyone’s going to come at it from a different angle. And knowing how another person approaches something might help you figure out the best way for you to do things. Thus, by giving your second Power Precision Sous Vide Cooker away to someone you know, you’re basically getting an assistant chef. Or maybe an IRL Youtube tutorial without the terrible five minute intro.
Then again, if you’re giving someone the gift of a sous vide cooker to receive the gift of advice for what you should use your sous vide cooker, you might involuntarily give them the gift of some advice about how they should use their sous vide cooker… which means, you’re only getting one gift while they get two.

Dearest Martha,
I wish I could say that I miss you. Alas, to suffer only a heavy heart would be a great relief! The truth is much worse than that. I write this letter because I am in grave danger, and I fear that I will suffer not death, but something much worse: a living death of sorts.
Yes, “fear”: a word you likely never thought you would see your husband write. For eight months, I cohabited with wild gorillas. For eleven, I roamed with a pack of wolves. For three, I swam with electric eels. I was buried a whole year among the bulldog ants of Australia in an attempt to understand their tunnel structure. Never once, in any of those cases, did I feel even remotely afraid. But none of them compare to this.
Though it may void my contract with the research firm, I will give you the full details of my current assignment: I was sent to integrate myself into a community of EarPod wearers, so that I might discern once and for all what makes them such incredible assholes.
I have, for the last month, been living among them somewhere in the Bay Area in what I believe is an apartment, but also seems to be a concert venue and startup. The startup is focused on an app of some kind but no one here actually programs. They all work as “organic social marketing disruptors” though many also dabble, I’m told, in graphic design. They wear their EarPods always. And so do I.
This is what I mean by a living death, Martha. Since putting the EarPods in, I have begun to have thoughts that seem not to belong to me. At first it was just, PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT on a constant loop. But as I acclimated, I began to think things like It’s too bad the world isn’t as present as me, or My podcast is better than this one, or What idiot called these EarPods instead of Lil’ Listenies? The other day, I thought once again about them falling out, but this time, it was, If these EarPods fall out, what’s going to keep my head from floating away?
Martha, I am losing it. Or: I am losing myself. So please, come quickly. Unfortunately, I am not sure my exact address, so you will have to fly to San Francisco and look for posters for a show we are hosting, featuring a performance by an artist named Transl8. He does electro-folk, as well as politically-conscious trip-hop.
Also, please bring a pair of Rowkin Bluetooth Earbuds. Just as I needed to take measures in order to avoid the bends when I resurfaced after spending those weeks with the angler fish, so must I do the same now. And those Rowkins are stylish, wireless, and way less obnoxious than EarPods. They should return me to myself in no time.
Make haste.

Think of your favorite Christmas mornings growing up: you woke up after barely sleeping, rushed to the tree, and tore open your presents. Then maybe came some reprieve–maybe you ate some pancakes and drank some hot cocoa–after which the real fun started: you spent the next several hours painstakingly assembling a tiny model from even tinier pieces so that it could sit atop your desk forevermore!
Okay, maybe that wasn’t exactly how it went. Probably, you played video games, or with some new action figures or dolls. Maybe you watched some movies on TV, maybe you ate more pancakes, drank some more cocoa, maybe you didn’t get out of your pajamas until four in the afternoon when it was time for Christmas dinner, and maybe you were ready for bed at seven, the calories and the sporadic sleep from the night before combining into a potent sleep aid.
And I wouldn’t blame you if that’s what you chose to do. Because those things are more enjoyable than building a model. But here’s something to think about: are they as satisfying?
Because there’s an important difference here. Yes, you might enjoy a candy bar more than taking a jog. Yes, you might enjoy bingeing ten seasons of some guilty-pleasure thriller on Netflix more than spending the afternoon preparing a five-course meal for your visiting relatives. And yes, you’re probably going to enjoy sitting around on the couch on Christmas overindulging in food, toys, and TV (or for adults: food, booze, and basketball) more than building the tiny model of the Eiffel Tower that you got in your stocking.
But you won’t be as satisfied.
Anyone who’s ever done anything requiring a modicum of will-power and ingenuity–even if only to solve a minor problem of their own making–knows that the accompanying frustration quickly gives way to a more lasting pride. Every deep breath you take all day will remind you of that jog. For weeks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment after making that meal. And while you might regret all of the pancakes and cocoa and movies and Christmas cookies well before December 26th, you will always be able to look at your model and think, with a smug sense of satisfaction, I did that.

Here’s how it works: we give you the claim the product makes, explain why we’re more than a little dubious, and then in the end, we come to some conclusion (if ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ can be considered a conclusion). Let’s get started!
The Claim
CBD is “a natural constituent of hemp” that “has been shown to have positive health benefits.” But since it contains no THC, it won’t get you high. Thus, it supposedly can help treat stuff like pain and anxiety with less risk of endless philosophizing or nachos.
The Skepticism
Here are pretty much all of the things we can definitively say about CBD:

It is short for cannabidiol.

Did we get all that? Does anyone need anything repeated? In the back? Can you all hear me?
Okay, that’s a simplification. There’s more. For example, we also know that, like Hansel, this CBD shit is just so hot right now. According to a New York Times article by Alex Williams, Willie Nelson is launching a line of CBD-infused coffee beans (two of his favorite things in one cup, he says), Mandy Moore is toying with it to see if it helps relieve the pain of walking in heels, and Glamour magazine ran a story with the headline “I Replaced My Entire Beauty Routine With Only CBD Products.” I am linking it here as proof. I refuse to actually read it, which I consider an act of self-care.
But what does it actually… do? Gabe Kennedy a twentysomething CBD start-up founder offers this:

Comparing it to the feeling after an intense meditation or yoga session, Mr. Kennedy added that the CBD glow has “synergistic downstream effects” in terms of social connections. “Around others, I find myself more present and attentive, more creative and open.”

To put my reaction in terms that Mr. Kennedy’s ilk would understand, I’d say the ROI on reading that paragraph was that I experienced an exciting disruption in the mouth sector, which, had I not cupped my hand over my lips, might just have gone viral all over my keyboard.
But while it’s fun to mock the eye-roll parade that the article provides, it also validates the claim made by Christie Aschwanden over at FiveThirtyEight: “the marketing has gotten way ahead of the science.”
Aschwanden is definitely more focused on the what than the why. Her article’s thesis is pretty well summed up by its headline: “Does CBD Really Do Anything?” There are definitely some serious WTF moments in here too. For example, when CBD-pedaling doctor Joe Cohen makes the claim that it has anti-cancer properties and might even help with Alzheimers, Aschwanden raises concern that these effects weren’t discussed in two of the most significant cannabis-focused reports out there. The good doctor’s reply: “I think you just have to Google search it.”
Moreover, though, she raises some important points, most notably that we don’t have mixed messages when it comes to CBD; we have almost no messages at all, because very few tests have looked at it on its own:

Animal models and a few human studies suggest that CBD can help with anxiety, but those are the only conditions with much research on CBD in isolation.

Otherwise, most studies focus on cannabinoids more generally, where they have actually found “‘conclusive or substantial evidence’ supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain in adults, multiple sclerosis-related spasticity (a kind of stiffness and muscle spasms), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”
Though, this assumes you’re getting a real dose, which also seems to be up in the air:

There are no guarantees that the label accurately reflects what’s in the product. For a 2015 study published in JAMA, researchers tested 75 products [cannabis] purchased in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle and found that only 17 percent were accurately labeled. More than half of the products contained significantly lower levels of cannabinoids than the label promised, and some of them contained only negligible amounts of the compounds.

The Conclusion
When we promise something here, we hold ourselves to it, so here comes: after reading about CBD, we can say, conclusively, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . But actually, it seems not to be super risky and to have some potentially great outcomes. So if you’re feeling anxious or a little achy, give it a try. Like most of this stuff, if you don’t think of it as a cure-all, you should be fine."	0.06			2018-11-02T04:00:05.893Z	0.42612956253890216	0.93	66292

It’s easy to come up with jokes about these things, and not just because they’re called “Lovesac Sactionals.” Like, imagine replacing all of a friend’s furniture with these one night, so they awake and believe they’ve grown. Or imagine a business man who uses them in his office as a power move, so that whenever someone comes to meet with him, they have to sit crouched to the ground feeling small.
But really, this hilarious world I’m describing, where everything is out of proportion is actually what young kids experience all the time, just inverted.
As @Superllama7 helpfully points out, “kids and pets can also use adult-sized furniture.” This is true, of course. Yet adult-sized furniture doesn’t really give kids a sense of ownership. Kids have toys and books. They have a bedroom they might share, and a bed to sleep in. But rarely are they given their own little space for quiet comfort in daytime, which is too bad, because it’s something they might like.
@2palms’s daughter did, at least: “with the double-wide seat she can get a leg up, then camp out in the corner with her books.” If that sounds super cute, I’ve got news for you: it is. @2palms includes two adorable pictures of “quiet morning reading time” on one of the 2 “chaise lounges” they put together. (@2palms elsewhere describes the Sactional furniture’s sturdiness, in case that’s a concern).
We should add that this time around, we’re selling them a bit differently than we did in September. Instead of doing it piece-by-piece, we’re offering a few different packages. You can get:
2 Seats, 4 Sides: Great for the kid who will occasionally keep the company of a couple action figures, perhaps a teddybear, but also enjoys a quiet night in with a good (pop-up) book.

That’s ridiculous, Lucy. It’s 2018; you need furniture for casual get-togethers.
8 seats, 10 sides: Basically everything you need to build a simple playpen, except one that’s softer and won’t raise the ire of your interior decorator friends.

Ladies and gentleman, friends and enemies, lovers and fighters, today we offer you something incredible: control of our most essential invisible resource, the very air we breath.
Birds? They are mere riders of the sky, nothing more than hangers-on. Airplanes? For all of their ingenuity, their undeniable feats of engineering, they still must heed the air’s wishes. When the air says, I shall have a massive storm here, in your flight path, does the plane puff out its chest and cry, Not today, air! Your storm can wait? No! The plane says, Ah, yes sir, yes sir, whatever you prefer, air! We shall find a new way to where we are going! And if the air says, The storm will be massive; there is nowhere to go, the plane replies with a nervous laugh, and says, Of course, sir! Totally understandable, sir! Take your time, sir! We will be right down here on the ground if you need us, sir!
In other words, birds are nihilists and planes are weak-willed.
You are neither.
The air might find its way through some unseen passageway into your house in the dead of night, at the height of winter. And it may say to you, Behold my dryness! It may say, Watch, as your knuckles fissure and grow red! Watch as your skin flakes! Watch as your lips chap, even in here, where you thought you were safe from my wrath! It will cackle with bitter delight as it watches you apply lotion and balm, knowing they are like cheap bandaids in the shadow of its vengeance.
Then the air will feel something itself, a chill. But more than that: it will feel the slow in-creep of moisture. It will say, Is there some glitch in your heating and cooling system? And you will point to your Pure Enrichment Cool Mist Humidifier, and you will say, “No, there is no glitch at all.” Then you will say, “Now dance, air!” And it will cry tears of humidity, but it will dance!

I, Clive Grunley, am not a mere athlete. Nor a biathlete. Nor a triathlete or anything so simple. No sir, I am a sexdecathlete, if you know what I mean!
What I mean is I compete in competitions comprising of sixteen distinct athletic feats. Why do you look so surprised? Did you think a sexdecathlete was something else?
A traditional sexdecathlon begins with a twenty mile run (1). Next, is a swim of at least 4 miles (2), but additional miles can be swum to earn tokens which can be used to hire additional bridge builders to help you build the bridge (3) back over the body of water you just swam across.
After that comes the javelin toss (4), followed by a short sprint (5), in order so that you can catch the same javelin you just tossed (6), and then, while holding it aloft, discuss with several gifted undergraduates how the javelin can serve, in literature, as a metaphor for one’s ascension and subsequent decline (7).
This is followed by a water break, which is not a break as in a moment of reprieve, but another event wherein each competitor builds a mold, pours water into it, freezes it, and then breaks the sculpture upon the shoulder of a competitor before they have one broken over theirs (8). Those who lose are disqualified, and given a strong handshake by those continuing on (9).
Next, you chop down a tree (10), then climb at least halfway up the tree (11), and carve some part of the three into a surfboard (12) while it is falling, so that you have something to ride when your tree eventually lands in the wave pool. You then ride a wave (13) to the artificial “shore” wherein a meeting ensues among remaining competitors as to how you might maintain the tree-related events while also promoting sustainability (14).
Which leaves nothing to do but cross the finish line (15) and exchange high fives (16). Yes, these count as events, as the finish line is a moat filled with poisonous snakes and we call them high fives because they must be completed atop a nearby mountain of you and your high-fiving partner’s choosing.
Anyway, the point being: after a long sexdecathlon, I’m beat. And I need at least three Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Packs to sooth my aches. I especially like that the texture provided by the ceramic beads allows for a nice massage. And let me tell you, us sexdecathletes might all be different, but every one of us likes a good rub!

If you’re shopping for yourself, you can get any food processor you want. You can take your parents’ old food processor. You can go to the thrift store, find one, search around for an outlet to make sure it spins, and take that one home. Or maybe you don’t need to go through all that trouble; maybe you just buy it as soon as you see it. If it doesn’t work, oh well! It was only a few bucks.
But if you’re getting someone a food processor as a gift, you need to do a little bit better than that. You don’t want to give your husband or wife or newly married friend something used that you’re pretty sure works. You need to give them something clean, something shiny, something new.
More than that: you need to give them a brand they’ve heard of.

Four truths and three lies about the artist Adam Koford:


Adam Koford, as a shirt designer often under the moniker of “Apelad”, has sold more than 260 designs on websites like Shirt.Woot, including several that this former Woot copywriter often still thinks of and laughs aloud.


Adam Koford’s art studio is in a house boat currently floating in international waters, the only place he can execute his diabolical pencil hold without being taken into police custody.


Adam Koford was, for a time, a jockey. He and his horse Maple Syrup were dominant, winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. On the track of the Belmont Stakes, though, disaster struck. Just feet from the finish line, Maple Syrup collapsed in a cloud of gray smoke, at which point it was discovered Maple Syrup was not a horse at all, but a robot powered, at its center, by a tiny car driving on a tiny treadmill.


Adam Koford is the creator of Laugh-Out-Loud Cats, a webcomic which can be viewed at HOBOTOPIA.com, as well as in a new book, One More For The Road, COMING SOON (stay tuned to Hobotopia for an official announcement in a couple weeks). A few months ago, he posted his 3000th Laugh-Out-Loud cats drawing. And since pictures are each worth a thousand words, that means Koford has produced the equivalent of 3 million words, the equivalent of somewhere between 30 and 50 novels. That’s impressive!


Adam Koford opens bananas by making several exacting surgical incisions with a scalpel. The peel-removal process can take up to two hours, but according to Koford, it’s worth it. “If you respect the fruit,” he says, “it will in turn respect you by unlocking heretofore hidden flavors.”


Adam Koford has worked as a senior writer and story artist on the video game versions of Bolt, Toy Story 3, and Cars 2. Which means he can say things like, “I wrote Toy Story 3,” and not technically be lying!

Many considered A Portal Among The Pages, published in 1978, to be the book that marked science fiction author Hal Pembry’s ascension from merely great into the canon. His previous seven novels to that point had been entertaining and thought-provoking, but few managed to evoke the magic that Portal  seemed to achieve so easily. As one reviewer wrote, “When Finley [the book’s protagonist] first finds the Encyclopedia of Time, he does not know that it functions essentially as a time machine, yet he senses something special between the covers. Readers might find this sensation quite relatable, as they sit in their favorite chair, holding Pembry’s masterwork aloft.”
His fans were eager to see what he would come up with next. And they were profoundly disappointed when the answer turned out to be: nothing. Pembry never wrote another book. In fact, he disappeared altogether. Many assumed he’d gone the way of other successful literary eccentrics–that the fame had been too much for him and so he’d retired somewhere quiet for a life of seclusion. Others posited that the terrible film adaptation had driven him to flee out of embarrassment. A small faction of particularly conspiracy-minded fans put forward a theory of murder at the hands of Kyle Tolliver, a rival author driven mad by jealousy because his own stellar novel’s release had been eclipsed by Portal (this being a pun many newspapers made while discussing the books’ relative sales, as Tolliver’s concerned a deadly solar eclipse).
None of these theories came close to the truth. In actuality, Pembry’s novel was a confession of what was to come: he’d discovered a way in which he could, through literature, bend time. I know because he told me when I spotted him last week outside of a used bookstore in Omaha. He did not look a day older than his author photo from forty years ago.
I asked what he thought of life in our current age and he said, “It’s okay. There are many things that science fiction foresaw, only different in minor ways. There are robots that work for you, but the one’s that move have no personality, and the ones with personality don’t move. They live in speakers and phones. And then there’s that.”
He pointed to the GOTRAX Hoverfly ECO Hover Board I had ridden up on.
“I’ve read all about those. About how their electrical safety is certified, about how they can go nearly 8 miles per hour and up to 12 miles distance before needing a charge. It’s truly a work of ingenuity. Only, when I and many of my contemporaries had imagined hover-vehicles, I thought they would truly hover. Again, it’s not that I’m unimpressed. Sometimes, I wish there was just a bit more whimsy. At any rate, I ought to be going.”
I asked him where and he corrected me. “It’s when,” he said, then told me to name a year. 1919 was what came to mind, and he took out a small unmarked book from his blazer pocket, opened it to a specific page somewhere in the middle. “Ah,” he said. “Interesting.” He pointed to a line written on the page. I tried to lean over and see but in that moment, there came a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew, Pembry was gone."	0.05			2018-10-26T04:00:03.801Z	0.24495605686952773	0.93	63926

We all have our preferences when it comes to luggage. Some of us prefer the hard-sided rolling bag. We like that what we see is what we get, that its shape remains steadfast always. We find comfort in knowing that our things will be safe inside. Perhaps we go on a vacation and buy a commemorative glass; with our hard-sided luggage we can be sure that it will be safe, as long as you don’t pack it too loosely. You don’t have to worry about some other bag in the cargo crushing it.
Others of us prefer the duffel. It’s casual but also classic. It can go down the street to the gym, or across the world to Shanghai. If you don’t have much to pack, it’ll take up less space. You can pack lightly or overpack a little bit. Its soft sides are forgiving. Also: they’re malleable. Pack one full of clothes, and you can squeeze it almost anywhere. It’s like a firmer pillow.
And yet…
There are times when we wish our hard-sided luggage had just a little bit more give to fit in the tight space behind the passenger seat of a fully packed car. And there are times when we’d like trust our duffel to hold its shape just a little bit more. For example, when we travel to wine country in Oregon, we want to bring back a bottle of wine, not a bag full of wet wine-scented clothing and some decorative shards of glass.
In other words: when it comes to bag-style our preference is not as firm as we might think. And facing this knowledge, it quickly becomes clear that the options aren’t hard-sided or duffel. They’re:

We can refuse to choose. We can eschew bags altogether. We can wear all of the clothes we want to bring on a given trip, layered over each other. The top layer can be pair of cargo pants and a hoodie with a big pouch. In the pockets: our toiletries, our travel knickknacks, our phones, etc.

Or…

We can choose both. As in, we can buy one of each: a U.S. Polo hard-sided bag, and a U.S. Polo rolling duffel. If we’re going for ten days at the vase expo, we can bring the hard-sided luggage. If we’re driving across the country and want something that’s easy to roll in and out of motels every night, we can take the duffel. But with both, we always have what you need.

Okay, fine. This is manipulative. If you really want to buy just one or the other, that’s fine too… But know this: some day, you might regret that choice–some day, you might need those hard sides or that soft top–and when that day comes, we won’t be able to help you. Because we’re a deal-a-day site. And we might not be selling luggage that day."	0.05			2018-10-25T04:00:09.038Z	0.19988858668938622	0.94	64860

What you get with other razors is pretty simple: a brand name and a shave. With these razors, we’re obligated to keep the company that makes them a secret. You might think that means you only get the shave, no name. But you actually get so much more! Such as:
A Smug Sense Of Superiority
These other people–nay, these other sheep–wander around, blindly trusting the messages pedaled by our corporate overlords, but not you. No, you’re enlightened. If you could sharpen kale stalks into rustic straight-blade razors, you would. But you can’t. You’ve tried. So you’re left with one other option: unnamed razors purchased on a cheap deal-a-day site. Are they corporately-made razors? Sure. But at least you get to say: “I may not be able to avoid you, but that doesn’t mean I have to like you!”
Potential Podcast Fame
Maybe buying a Gillette razor will give you some peace of mind. But you don’t build a podcast empire on peace of mind. You build it on unanswered questions. You build it information that seems forever on the periphery, always close, but never clear. What we’re saying is, if you buy these razors, it just lead you to launch a wildly popular serialized investigative podcast in order to search out the truth: who made the razors? Can Gillette give you that?
A Possible Connection To A Possibly Award Winning Movie
Will we say definitively that the razors we’re selling here are the same brand and style that Mr. Robot himself Rami Malek used to shave his other-worldly jawline, leaving only the iconic Freddie Mercury mustache for his performance in what just might be the film of the year, Bohemian Rhapsody? No. We won’t say that. But we also won’t definitively say that it’s NOT the same type of razor he used either. Eh?

There’s a double-standard here. If you buy a shirt that’s slimming and shave every day because your facial hair comes in patchy or comb your hair a certain way that looks best with your face-shape, it wouldn’t be considered inauthentic. If anything, it’s the opposite. It shows an intelligence, an understanding of what you have and what works best. Because none of those things are harmful or uncomfortable or particularly time-consuming. They’re just simple steps you take to look your best.
On the other hand, if you try to slow the thinning of your hair–or at least slow the appearance of your hair thinning–that’s considered inauthentic. It’s mocked. Men are told that going bald is embarrassing, but also that covering up baldness is embarrassing. Because it exhibits some denial of reality, a fight against what nature has intended for you.
To which, we reply: Yeah, no shit! And there’s nothing wrong with that!
Maybe at some point, we can all wear ponchos, choosing between three or four each morning based solely on thickness of material. Those who are not going bald will stop cutting their hair, and those who are going bald will allow their hair to recede without ridicule. We will all stop showering, and we will all stop brushing our teeth, and we will cease complaining about the natural odors of our bodies and breath. And if some lose their teeth because theirs are weak, they will drink only nutritional juice of a greenish-brown color, and no one will judge them for it.
Until then, we just gotta do what we gotta do to look whatever way feels best. And if that’s using a hair fiber and locking spray, so be it.
(And P.S., yes: given that we have out spoken against pseudo-science in the past, we did give a healthy amount of side-eye to the marketing copy that claims, “negatively charged Moroccan cotton fibers adhere to positively charged individual strands of natural human hair at the root for a noticeably fuller look.” But here’s the thing: there’s a difference in how harmful it is to say some fibers make your head look nice versus claiming an aligned chakra is the best arthritis medicine, so we’ll let it slide.)"	0.05			2018-10-23T04:00:01.475Z	0.3256555514094781	0.94	62467			0.10346348247905289

When the exorcist arrived, the toy seller was pacing the sidewalk in front of his shop.
“You called,” the exorcist said, “for some assistance?”
“Oh, it’s you,” the toy seller cried. “I was worried you might not arrive in time. Yes, yes. I am in desperate need of your help! Some of my toys, you see: they’ve been possessed!”
“Let me guess,” the exorcist said. “Tiny toy soldiers are mounting a microscopic war against you.”
“No,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s little knights, I’m sure,” the exorcist said. “They ride in upon plastic horses and jab you with their surprisingly sharp lances.”
“It’s not them either,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s certainly dolls and stuffed toys,” the exorcist proclaimed. “Raggedy Annes and Andys, sock monkeys, and teddy bears, all singing ironic songs of friendship while stalking your every move, each brandishing pencils sharpened into shivs.”
“Actually,” the toy seller said, “it’s fidget spinners.”
“Wait, what? Fidget spinners? Seriously?”
“I’m afraid it’s very serious,” the toy seller said. “They just won’t stop… spinning.”
“That’s it,” the exorcist said. “They’re just spinning? Like fidget spinners do? But on their own?”
“Exactly! And I have work to do! But I can’t anything done! Because I’m so distracted by their infernal noises! Some of them even glow!”
The exorcist nodded. “I understand. They glow brightly with the spirits of the dead.”
“Nope,” the toy seller said. “They’re just the LED kind. And they don’t all glow very brightly. They’re pretty hit-or-miss, to be honest. A lot of them are fine, but the lights on some are dim, or out entirely. That’s why we’re selling them for cheaper than the non-LED ones.”
“Okay,” the exorcist said. “I think I know what to do. But I’ll need absolute privacy while I carry out the… um… exorcism. And I’m sorry to say, I’ll need to take the fidget spinners with me. To… ensure they don’t get possessed again or whatever.”
The toy seller did not object. In fact, he hugged him and thanked him with tears and his eyes. The exorcist assured him it would all be okay. Then, leaving the man to pace again on the sidewalk, he stepped into the store. It was true: the fidget spinners were possessed. They spun and spun and spun, until the exorcist said a quick three-word incantation, returning them finally to stillness.

Welcome to everyone’s favorite day: Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, wherein we offer a new shirt or whatever every Sunday until, eventually, we get lazy or forget and it ends! Today’s shirt requires a little more explanation than the others. Basically, it’s the Casemates launch shirt, on royal blue… BUT you get a choice: the original sketchy version of the logo (and that’s sketchy as in sketch-like; not like, “it can’t be trusted”) or a new exciting more geometric-looking logo!
That leaves you with four potential purchase choices:
You Purchase The Classic Design
This the option for people who respect tradition. You want a shirt you can wear each night when you return to your victorian home and settle into your bergère chair to re-read Don Quixote. What’s that playing in the background? Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16, of course. And what’s that you’re drinking? Maybe a glass of 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir, or maybe a Boulevardier cocktail that you’ve been antiquing for a few days in a mason jar in the fridge. It all goes just smashingly with your new (or should we say old?) Casemates shirt!
You Purchase The New Design
Here, we have the modern choice. You’ll look right at home wearing this when you pull your electric car into the driveway of your house, a recent construction comprised, it appears, of only the most jagged of edges. Inside, you’ll ask your digital assistant to play the latest release from your favorite musician, a masked individual from a country far away who makes electronic music that is one step removed from the dial-up modem noise. Then you’ll settle in to read a collection of experimental prose poetry while sitting on a piece of brutalist furniture that might be a couch but also might be an end table; you can’t remember. What you are sure of: how comfortable you feel in your exciting new Casemates shirt!
You Purchase Both
This one goes out to all those who toe the line between classic and modern. You like mid-century modern furniture. You listen to blue-grass covers of new wave songs and new wave covers of blue-grass songs. In short, you appreciate all things: from the old and traditional to the new and innovative. If we may be so bold: this is definitely the best choice.
You Purchase Neither
This choice, on the other hand… well, it’s not really a choice at all. It’s the absence of one. You’ve essentially chosen not to choose. To put it bluntly, you are empty. You see stories about rescue dogs on Facebook and feel nothing. you stand directly in front of the elevator doors waiting for them to open, not because you’re in a rush, not because you think you’re better than other people, but because you haven’t thought at all. Often, you feel as though you’ve forgotten something. Your phone? No. It’s in your pocket. Your wallet? No. That’s there too. Your keys? No again. Really, you have forgotten nothing; instead, what you’re experiencing is the sensation of your being crying out to fill the hole where a soul should be.
Anyway, hope this helps you make your decision! Happy Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, and until next time (if there is a next time)…"	0.07			2018-10-21T04:00:03.298Z	0.49400280593593765	0.94	54240

This is a drone. It does what drones do. It flies around for nine minutes, hovers in the air, etc. @Moose tested it. He said it actually was one of the easiest to fly, and might be the most stable of the ones he’s tried for our site. They could’ve marketed it for that: its ease and stability.
Or maybe they could’ve called it a photo drone or a video drone, because it does have a camera that can take 1.3MP pictures and 720p videos. After all, drones are often used for photos or videos. My pretty basic wedding package featured a video done with a drone. Remember that shot at the end of 10 Things I Hate About You, of the band playing on the top of building while the credits rolled? That shot probably required licensed pilots, a helicopter, crew members, waivers, the works. Now, anyone could make something that looks like that, for, I’d estimate, 5 figures less thanks to drones. Like this one.
And no: a Remake-The-Last-Shot-Of-10-Things-I-Hate-About-You-Or-Something-Like-It Drone isn’t exactly going to move units here in 2018… but it would probably be better than Selfie Drone.
Like, are you fucking serious? The phrase “selfie drone” is verbal ipecac. It takes ingenuity and renders it into an overcomplicated way for millennials to engage in the act that has become synonymous with the self-absorption most other generations (wrongly) know them for.
Still, what annoys me isn’t the how clear it is that this product was definitely named by some old dude thinking he’d discovered a new way to “reach the youth.” It had to be, by the way, because, say what you will about millennials, they at least know what a selfie is, and a photo that you need a drone’s angle to capture is not a selfie; it’s a photo with you in it. There’s a difference.
What annoys me is how reductive it is. It’s a dumb marketing 101. It thinks it’s carved out some entirely new lane in the drone game by catering to the selfie-obsessed among us, without taking into account the large number of people that it would turn off. Like, there are probably folks who arrived at the site today, read the product name, and said, “oh, no way,” and navigated away without reading another word. Or even if they did get further, they might still be thinking, It could be cool… but cool enough to risk my friends seeing a box that says “Selfie Drone” on it in the week before the recycling gets picked up? I don’t know…
That’s what really annoys me. But it doesn’t annoy me that much, to be honest. I mean, there’s a reason we can sell this thing here for $20. And it’s not because it’s a bad drone."	0.07			2018-10-20T04:00:46.966Z	0.34139579152096994	0.94	51885

Dear iRobot,
You’ve done what many companies aspire to do, but few actually achieve. In this stratosphere of success, your company is elite: Xerox, Kleenex, Ping Pong. Your product’s name–the Roomba–is now synonymous with (or maybe even supersedes) the “robot vacuum cleaner.” Congratulations.
And many of us here at Meh have been along for the ride since nearly day one. Yet, there’s something that’s frustrated us over the years: every time we sell a Roomba, we realize the model is slightly different than the previous one, despite looking almost exactly the same. We then dive into hours of research, hoping to solve the mystery of what’s so different in order to help our customers make an informed purchasing decision–only to find, in the end,  something trivial, like the canister capacity being one tenth of a percent larger than before.
What we’re saying here, iRobot, is: help us. Or, help us help you. Why not give every  new Roomba a feature that really STANDS OUT, so that they can be easily differentiated?
For example:


You could make one that says “sorry” whenever it bumps into a wall. An another that cries out in pain whenever it bumps into a wall. And another that recites a poem by Robert Frost in a Mike Tyson accent whenever it bumps into a wall.


Or a model that kisses your ankles when it goes by so that you know it loves you.


How about a Roomba that can take all the crumbs from the kitchen floor and forms them into new snacks for you to serve at your next party?


Maybe one Roomba could feature “pie warmth and texture.” And then the ""Plus ""version of that model could also feature “pie flavor.” And it could just be a pie.


Or what about a Roomba that just came with one completely functional human finger? Is that too much to ask?


Look, iRobot: the sensors, the 3-Stage Cleaning System, the ability to automatically adjust to any floor and navigate around furniture–that stuff is cool and all, but it’s also what we expect. Why not give people something a bit more unique? It would certainly be great for us. And if it’s great for us, isn’t it great for you too?
Just something to think about.
Sincerely,

“Another lame Halloween,” Arthur said. “It’s like, what’s wrong with giving out candy? Everyone around here tries to get too creative. I got the worst stuff.”
“You got the worst? Wait until you see what I’ve got,” Lisa said.

Lisa leaned over and looked. “Are those malt balls floating in it?”

“How is it?”
“It’s okay. There are some point of telling issues. Like, if you’re going to use a retrospective POV, the narrator can’t be surprised by the events as they unfold. Also, some of the fantastical elements frustrate me. I keep thinking: what are the rules of this world?”
“Huh,” Arthur said. “I wouldn’t be much help. I’m a journalist, not a novelist. Or at least I am now that a woman on Church Street gave me this.” He handed a diploma over to Lisa.
“Wow, a journalism degree! From George Washington University! They could be really useful,” Lisa said, “for mopping up the soup!”

Probably, we should lie. We should say that this is practical. We should say something like: you can garden from inside! We should claim something about how, with the success of HBO’s Sharp Objects, wealthy families have a renewed interest in dollhouses, and some of them are even hiring full construction crews to break ground and build them; get the heavy duty equipment your crew needs to beat out the other bidders!
But we won’t. Instead, we’ll look both ways, we’ll lean forward, we’ll gesture for your to lean forward too, and then we’ll whisper into your ear…

Two-for-Tuesday? Where’s the ambition in that? Yes, it sounds nice. But we can’t let alliteration lower our standards. So today, it’s four-for-Tuesday or twenty-four-for-Tuesday (which, I guess is technically alliterative).
That’s right, a choice between four or twenty-four. You know that means, it’s…
ORDER/HOARDER!!!
In these semi-regular sales, we provide two options: one a fair number of things for a good price; the other is an unfair number of things for a GREAT price. So, without further ado, let’s get started.
Today’s product is…
FLEECE BLANKETS!
I don’t know about where you all live, but here, the weather has taken a dark turn. It even snowed yesterday! Which means: it’s time to make a nice cup of tea or cocoa and bundle up under a fleece blanket on the couch with one to twelve dogs and/or cats for the next five months.
THE MATH
The four-pack will run you $14. That’s $3.50 per blanket. Not bad, right? But wait! The twenty-four pack goes for $60. That’s $2.50 per blanket. But wait even more! If the first four cost $14, that means the last twenty cost just $46, which is $2.30 per blanket! Does it make sense to break it down like that? Probably not! But that’s how we do it here on Order/Hoarder days!
WHAT TO DO WITH FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
With four fleece blankets, you can put one on the couch, one on recliner, keep one in the office, and still have a backup to rotate in when one is being washed. Or, store them all in a closet and break them out for a late fall bonfire.
WHAT TO DO WITH TWENTY-FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
So! Much! For example:


You could give them out as gifts to twenty-four of your favorite people!


Or, if you don’t have twenty-four favorite people, give them as gifts to twelve of your favorite people! (You can use the remaining twelve fleece blankets as wrapping paper for the other twelve fleece blankets!)


Send one to each venue on your favorite band’s 24-stop winter tour to show you’re a true fan!


Or, give one to all but four members of the twenty-eight piece Swedish indie pop group, I’m From Barcelona, in case they have to play any cold weather outdoor festivals! If they complain about not everyone getting a blanket, just tell them you’re not the idiot who decided to start a twenty-eight person band!


Use them to build a winter-ready tent in the bank yard! Actually, hell, you’ve got 24 fleece blankets! Build a winter-ready tent mansion!


Interior decorators will tell you that the right lighting can give rooms a soft, warm feeling; we say, why stop at lights? Why not take that “soft, warm feeling” over the top by wallpapering your house with fleece blankets?


See? Maybe twenty-four fleece blankets isn’t so impractical after all.
So, what’s it going to be: are you going to place a boring old order, or are you going to take the exciting first steps to becoming a fleece blanket hoarder?"	0.05			2018-10-16T04:00:03.596Z	0.3410857897640822	0.93	63281

Let’s start off general and work our way into more specifics. Every laptop manufacturer calls their product something different, but a Chromebook isn’t just a cool name. It’s actually a different kind of computer. Laptop Magazine sums it up nicely:

Instead of Windows 10 or macOS, Chromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. These machines are designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with most applications and documents living in the cloud.

In other words, if you live in a cabin somewhere in the mountains, and you have to hike and ski many miles back to civilization to grab a solitary bar of wi-fi, this might not be your best bet. Nor would it be a good option if you’re looking for a machine that can support your career cutting movie trailers and playing the latest computer games. These things are pretty sparse, in terms of power.
But for the rest of us, who pretty much never stray far from the router and who mostly use our computers for checking email, keeping track of things, writing, and organizing: a Chromebook is actually a pretty great, pretty cheap option.
And this one is actually both of those things: we’re selling it for just under $150, and on Amazon it has four stars on over 1,000 reviews.
Yes, if you want to be cynical, you could say: but wait, Meh, this thing came back out who-knows-when, and many of those reviews were written a while ago. And that’s true. BUT 1) there were still five star reviews coming in as recently as August of 2018; and 2) never underestimate the online reviewer. Like, these people self-identify as arbiters of all that is good (and not good) to buy; do you really think they wouldn’t rush to update their review the minute anything goes wrong?
Besides, let’s be totally honest: as much as we like to talk about the forward march of tech, most of us are still using our computers for the exact same things as we did five years ago. New apps come and go, but we’ll always need to make spreadsheets and type up documents and check our email.
Who knows? Maybe it’s a blessing it’s a little older: it might mean it was unaffected by the Gmail redesign. That’d be worth the price alone, if you ask us!"	0.05			2018-10-15T04:00:05.520Z	0.2839675274780344	0.93	64996

Mr. Khool was the coolest teacher at Meh High. He taught an elective called The Mathematics of Skating, a class he only managed to get approved after bringing the principal to a skate park and catching phat air while explaining how each side of a halfpipe was essentially a graph of exponential growth. Now, he was on his way to teach his first session of it when, rounding a corner, he heard stifled sobs.
Narf, hunched next to the water fountain, tried to straighten up when he saw Mr. Khool approaching. “Oh, hey, Mr. Khool. I was just… uh… making sure the fountains weren’t leaking.”
“Sounds like the only thing leaking are your eyes, l’il guy,” said Mr. Khool, crouching next to him. “You want to talk about it?”
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Narf said. “It’s just… well… I feel like when all the other kids ask for stuff, they get it right away. Toothbrushes. Jerky. Fidget spinners. But I’ve been asking for the same thing for years, and nobody takes me seriously.”
“I know what you’re going through,” Mr. Khool said.
“You do?”
“Sure! Being a cool guy is great, but sometimes it’s hard to get people to take me seriously. They think it’s all kick flips and cliff jumps, when really that’s only like 60 to 70 percent of what I do. There’s also a lot of hard work that nobody gives me credit for. But you know what? Whenever I start to feel like maybe it’s time to trade my longboard in for a Prius, I remind myself: there’s a reason progress and persistence both start with p. A friend of mine told me that once. His name was Tony Hawke.”
Narf’s eyes went wide. “Tony Hawk the skateboarder?”
“No,” Mr. Khool said. “This is Hawke with an e. He was Ethan Hawke’s second cousin. We played in a band together in college. And actually he went by Anthony.”
“So do you just call him Tony Hawke so people think you’re talking about Tony Hawk?”
“It doesn’t matter why I do it,” Mr. Khool said. “The point is, it’s a decision I made to call him Tony. And we all have decisions to make in this life. So, are you going to give up, or are you going to decide to keep chasing your dreams?”
Narf stood up. “You’re right! It doesn’t matter that it’s taken this long! I can’t give up now, not for anything!”
“That’s right! So, what is it that you’ve been asking for?”
“A cat shirt,” Narf said.
“Wait, seriously?” Mr. Khool said, getting to his feet. “But you’re Narf. You’re wearing a cat shirt right now. And you wore one yesterday. And the day before that. And actually every other day too. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the same cat shirt twice, now that I think about it.”
Narf slung his backpack over his shoulder. “Sorry, Mr. Khool. I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve gotta get to chem. Thanks again! You really said exactly what I needed to hear!”
“That’s great,” Mr. Khool said. “Although, maybe we need some other designs?”
But Narf was already off and running to his next class.

Douglas, We’re glad you’re here. We can see you’re confused, but don’t worry: all will be explained. You see, when LeAnn said to come home so you two could “take a scenic flight over a pristine lake” together, she was lying. This is an intervention. We, your friends and family–we’re all worried about you, Douglas.
It all began when you bought that Odyssey Stellar NX Drone. You said it was a way to bond with your son. But you didn’t let Trevor use it much, did you, Douglas? Still, it was a fun hobby for you. You liked that it came with a VR headset, so you could see from the drone’s POV. You would fly it, recharge it, fly it, recharge it, all day.
Only after a few months did we start to see the warning signs. You walked into furniture, cursing your legs. You started standing on the dining table to watch television. You called this “a more natural prospective.”
Then there was the mini drone that came with your purchase of the original drone. You started calling it ‘l’il guy,’ then ‘son,’ then finally you named it. It would’ve seemed cute, if you didn’t choose, ‘Trevor,’ the same name as your real son.
Yes, Douglas, that’s right: only one of them is your real son. Because you are not a drone, Douglas! You are a man! You might spend days coming out of drone-prospective for only as long as it takes your Odyssey to charge. You might spend these times with your eyes closed tight, whispering, “it’s a dream, it’s just a dream,” so as not to face the fact that you are a human being, and as such, you are bound by gravity to remain on the ground.
But it’s not healthy, Douglas! You have a family! You have a job! You have obligations! You can’t just ignore them because you have “a new life in the sky” now. It can be a fun hobby, but you’ll never really be a drone, Douglas. You need to start seeing that. And moreover, you need to apologize to all of us for what you’ve put us through. Let’s start with Trevor.

User @alacrity wants one thing and one thing only: a margarita.
When we sold a Copper Cookware set, they wrote:

well, I guess I could serve margaritas in these…

On a two-pack of posture trainers:

it has to be said: these make really shitty margaritas.

For a 2-pack of cast aluminum skillets:

well, I guess I could drink a margarita out of em… but there’s still the salted rim thing.

A coffee maker:

this will make very hot margaritas.

Earrings:

these are absolutely useless for margaritas.

You might notice that these are not all sales from the last few months. No, @alacrity has lived with desire for years. But that will change today. Because today we are selling a Cuisinart Waring Pro Blade Blender.
And yet the story does not end here. What we want to know is: how does @alacrity feel about this?
Will they arrive at the site today relieved? Will they cry aloud, “For many years I have wished for nothing more than a sweet lime-rich tequila cocktail. And at long last, the great Meh has delivered to me a device that shall itself deliver me to my own personal paradise. Thank you, Meh! Thank you so much!”?
Or will they feel some resentment? Will they realize, all too late, that the real margarita was the friends they made along the way? Or, to put it differently: is there any margarita that’s as sweet on the lips as camaraderie is to the heart?
And yet, there remains a fact we have not reconciled: uhh, like, hello? We’ve sold blenders before!
So perhaps we’re misreading @alacrity. Perhaps, they do not hope for their own margaritas at all. Perhaps they seek only to be a sort of margarita-specific town-crier, to stand in the virtual park at the center of Meh and warn all those around them about the dangers of attempting margaritas in products not optimized for margaritas.
And then of course, there is the final possibility: maybe @alacrity prefers margaritas on the rocks.
So what is it? Only time will tell. And by time, we mean: hopefully @alacrity in the forums."	0.05			2018-10-12T04:00:20.860Z	0.34750686103289724	0.94	59130

Watches? I never wear watches. Why would I wear a watch in the age of cellphones? That’s what I say. Because I believe in efficiency. It guides my every waking move, from the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the time I lay down to sleep at night. (That’s the alarm on my phone, by the way. Why have an alarm clock when you have a cell phone?)
But it’s one thing to say you believe in efficiency, and it’s a whole other thing to live by it. I know because I do. To prove it, I’ll run through my average morning:
First thing’s first, I make breakfast. It’s the same every day: spaghetti and meatballs. I have it for lunch too. And dinner. Food is food, isn’t it? Why should I have different foods for different meals?
When I’m done eating, I floss and brush my teeth, then spit into the drain in my shower. Because why have a sink when you have a shower? Is not a shower a human-height sink? Think about that for a second. Anyway, when I’m done brushing my teeth, I wash my hands with shampoo. Soap-products are soap-products, after all! Then I shave, checking my reflection in the mirror–by which I mean, my phone, on selfie mode.
A little bit of leisure time is part of being efficient too. So, before heading out the door to work, I take twenty minutes to relax. I might watch a show (on my phone) or read a book (on my phone). But soon enough it’s time to check the weather (on my phone). To confirm the app, I look out the window–the single window I have in my whole house. Why do I need to see out my house from so many different sides? Outside is outside, no matter what way you’re looking at it. One window is plenty.
Using this information, I decide what I’m going to wear: pants or shorts. I should elaborate; it’s the one garment, but it’s got a zipper so I can unzip them at the knee when it gets warm. It’s the same pair I wear every day, because again, for me it’s all about efficiency. Not everyone is a fan of this. My sister, for example, once said she actually hated my zip-on pant-shorts. She said I should switch things up by wearing something else sometimes. She said that by wearing them I was ruining her wedding. Can you believe that?
She hasn’t spoken to me since then, but I don’t mind. I still have another sister, and honestly, at the time, I was in the middle of a painful decision of which sister I would keep. Two sisters? Are you crazy? Who needs all that in your life?
Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh, right: these watches. Yep, don’t need them. Although, they would go nicely with the one sweatshirt always I wear, especially on days when it’s hot enough that I have to roll up the sleeves. And if you’re wondering why I don’t just take it off, it’s simple: I’m not wearing anything underneath. Wearing a shirt under what is essentially another shirt?

Imagine for a moment you’re a secret agent. You’ve been called upon to infiltrate a very important party held by a tycoon with designs to take over the world. You need to take a video of the party, so key attendees can be identified, and hopefully sneak into the study where you’re told the plans for the doomsday device are kept. For this mission, you’ll be provided with a PogoCam. It’s smaller than a tube of lip balm, attaches magnetically to your favorite pair of glasses, and shoots 5 megapixel photos and 720p HD videos. You just need to go to Q to collect it.
FYI: in this imagined scenario, Q refers to the dumpster behind the Qwikmart convenience store down the block, not the genius gadgeteer from the movies. Because, boy oh boy, would that guy steer clear of this thing.
In fact, over on Amazon the PogoCam only has 2.5 stars. That’s some real ruh-roh territory, especially given most products fall into a 3 star rating just by being delivered. People who bought it without the Pogotrack sunglasses offered here griped about the safety loop required when using your own pair.  Others complain about the picture quality or that it only takes 30-second video clips.  One user goes even further: “while I have little proof,” LE says, “[I] believe PogoCam has been the cause of much of the world’s turmoil lately.”
Not great!
But here’s the thing: since it’s come out and been revealed to be of less than desirable quality, the PogoCam’s price has tanked. In fact, I’m told that at one point is retailed for as high as $150. That’s nuts. But even with all those price drops, it’s still just shy of 50 on the 'zon.
We’re selling it for $24. For that price, it can just be a fun little gimmicky impulse buy. Wear it once or twice and you’ve pretty much justified the purchase. If you get it to work better than a bunch of Amazon reviewers and find some real use for it, awesome! If not, at least you got some sweet magnetic sunglasses out of the deal.

“Well, sir,” the engineer said, “I like to think of it like this: by adding a number of attention-grabbing but ultimately unnecessary and overcomplicated ‘smart’ features, we’d only introduce the possibility for bugs and glitches. Not to mention we would have to put out different models for different phones and tablets. So, despite how it may seem, this is a ‘smart’ product, in that simplicity is smart, because it leads to ease of use and universal compatibility.”
The CEO pounded his fist on the table. “I like that! I like that a lot! Not smart is actually smart! That’s great! That’s gonna help me a lot, not just at work, but also in my personal life!”

We’re entering the time of year when everything freezes and dies and allergies are replaced by a sense of tired dryness. For some of you, this might be a relief. And yet, consider these two things: first, said dryness does nothing to dry up non-seasonal allergies, like those related to pets; and second, spring will be back sooner than you think with its pollen-thick air. And just like the smart shopper buys next year’s wrapping paper the day after Christmas when it’s marked down to nothing, so too does he or she purchase an allergen-optimized vacuum just as allergy season winds down.
And boy oh boy, does this thing suck up allergies. In fact, it “captures and traps 99.9% of dust and allergens down to 1 micron.” As a non-allergy-sufferer myself, I don’t know exactly what that means. I can tell you that, given the the word “micron” is pretty much just “micro” with an n, it sounds pretty small.
What I actually CANNOT understand is what the fuck “MultiFLEX Technology” is. I know that it “provides flexible reach for under furniture and freestanding, compact storage.” But what does that mean, exactly? Digging a little deeper, I found that the “MultiFLEX wand bends so you don’t have to, reaching under low lying furniture with ease.” So, apparently, it’s a kind of semi-flexible wand? That’s it? Seriously?
But friends, I’m not mad. No, not at all. In fact, I think it’s smart. Genius even! Every feature of every product, regardless of how mundane, should get the marketing-speak treatment. For example:

Yes, on one level, the design is simple: it’s the Meh face, or should we say, the many (meh-ny) Meh faces you see when you come to our site. It’s a button. You press it. You keep a streak going, if you want. Or else you don’t; you reserve the Meh button only to show your nonplussedness. It’s something that makes our site special, a little inside joke among you, the customer, and us.
But, on another level, the design means so much more. It’s a tribute. To us. And all we’ve done for the world of commerce. Before we came along, all was excitement, and much of it was false. Companies didn’t know that it was fine enough to be, well, fine enough. Everything had to be glorious and exuberant. But then we showed up, and we taught people that it doesn’t always have to be that way. You don’t have to worry about moving the proverbial needle. You don’t need to dial it up to a ten. You can hang out at a five if you want.

In this bundle, you get a power bank and a dual USB travel charger (meaning a wall charger with two USB ports). It’s pretty simple, except for one wrinkle, which is that you get to choose what capacity power bank you want: 4200, 6000, or 9000 mAh. Now, most modern phones can be fully charged with between 2000 and 3000 mAh, which means even the smallest power bank we’re offering can charge your phone somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times. By that standard, you could get 2.5 to 3 full charges with a 6000 mAh power bank, and 4.5 to 5 with the 9,000.
But look, we’re not going to spend the next few hundred words talking math. It’s too abstract. The most helpful thing to do would be to provide brief profiles for who might require each power capacity, so that you identify yourself among them. Here goes:

You’ve got a full day ahead of you, enacting archaic rituals and making shady transactions in a number of parks in and around Cincinnati. And let’s just say the Corrigans didn’t factor in any time for you to stop and juice up your phone. Which is a problem, because you need to be face-timing the entire time so they can be sure you don’t call the cops. In short: you’re gonna need some serious recharge power.

You find that you have an intense desire to work out. You go running and clock 18 miles easily. The next day you go further. And further after that.

You’re afraid that if it does, this will all come crashing down. And yet, you’re always setting off on some new adventure. You don’t get a chance to charge that often.

I said YES!!!” or “It’s a healthy baby girl, 7 lbs, 12 ounces!” And you’re responding, “k,” because even typing out a simple “congrats” would take about twenty minutes. And you don’t have that kind of time. Because you’re at a red light. And you’ve gotta look down at the directions you printed out from MapQuest.

Each year, representatives from all 50 European countries gather for the EuroSock Summit to discuss potential changes to the sock’s age-old design. Here is a summary of year’s Summit, which took place in Luxembourg in a chamber deep inside the Grand Ducal Palace:


The representative from Sweden proposed changing the design, so that the sock appeared strangely both modern yet antiquated, like a torture device, but also attractive and entirely comfortable. Motion failed to pass by a vote of 11 to 39.


The representative from Italy proposed making the next EuroSock as soft as the richest pillowy ball of burrata, as delicate to touch as the most sumptuous pluck-able leaves of basil, and yet as firm as tagliatelle cooked to a perfect al dente. Also: more garlic. Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 19 to 31.


The representative from France proposed making the sock from a distinct material that would grow delightfully crusty over night, so to it could be enjoyed the next day. There was some confusion over this, but eventually the representative from France admitted she was simply hungry, having been disappointed in her hotel’s bread options that morning at breakfast. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Norway proposed making the sock seven times thicker. When someone suggested he have multiple pairs of socks–some for summer, others for winter–he smiled and nodded, saying, “Yes, exactly! These would be for summer!” Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 3 to 47.


The representative from Ireland proposed making the socks out of a darker fabric, one “as pitch black as a Guinness.” The representative from Belgium chimed in to add that the fabric should be strong, “not unlike a delicious quadrupel.” The German representative also leaned forward to propose adding a pinch of sea salt, “one of the key ingredients in a traditional gose.” When they all three broke down laughing it became clear that they’d partaken in a few of the aforementioned beverages during the break for lunch. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Lithuania proposed shelving sock-talk for a bit. Instead, she suggested, maybe they should open some rakia, grappa, limoncello, champagne, or what have you and join their Irish, Belgian, and German compatriots, who were obviously having the best time of anybody. Motion passed by a vote of 50-0.

When I first saw that we were selling an air fryer, I was torn.
On the one hand, Wirecutter pretty emphatically stated that they don’t recommend these things for how expensive they are. If you’re not familiar with Wirecutter, they’re basically one of the best and most straightforward resources for when you’re buying kitchen appliances, electronics, and just about everything in between. They do a lot of research and provide simple, easy-to-understand articles replete with concrete purchasing recommendations. So, their opinion carries a lot of weight.
On the other hand, my dad has an air fryer and he likes it.
Two venerable sources. Two contradictory opinions. I didn’t know who to trust. So I began to dig deeper. Here’s what I found:


While working on his Wirecutter article, Michael Sullivan conducted more than 35 hours worth of air fryer tests. In the end, he was so unimpressed with them that he recommended buying a simple convection toaster oven to get a better bang for your buck.


Back when I was in high school, my dad used to change my car’s oil. Not just check it, mind you, but perform a full-blown change. He had a little pit in the garage, so you could pull your car right in and he’d take care of it every 3000 miles.


Given those two facts, I came to the following conclusion: it was possible that my dad had also used his air fryer for 35 total hours, yet it was very unlikely that Michael Sullivan had ever changed the oil in my car when I was in high school. This seemed like a pretty clear “checkmate” situation. But then I remembered that an air fryer’s greatest selling point is its oil-free frying. Thus, it only seemed fair that all oil-based arguments need be discarded. I found myself right back at square one.
Then it hit me: my dad is a Meh customer. He likely bought his air fryer right here on this very site. Meanwhile, Wirecutter suggests a model that retails at about $250, which is FIVE TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS ONE. Furthermore, they never say they’re outright bad; they just say they aren’t worth the money. Which makes sense: my dad would likely not be the satisfied air-frying customer he is today had he been required to fork over more than 200 bucks.
Therefore, Wirecutter, I know we’ve suggested this before, but if you’re reading this, consider an addendum to your initial verdict of “Not recommended”: something like, “unless it’s selling on Meh for almost a fifth of the cost, in which case, go to town.” I’d be happy to put you in touch with my dad if you need any more information."	0.05			2018-10-03T04:00:13.622Z	0.4058992852291472	0.92	65054		0.15524434813545068

In the grand scheme of things, I’m pretty smart about health stuff. No, not necessarily among other humans. I mean in the REAL grand scheme, as in: among all living creatures in the world. I sometimes eat too many donuts, or drink so much coffee that I give myself a headache. But I at least KNOW what I’ve done immediately after I’ve done it. And compared to my cats or my dog, I come out looking like a friggin’ genius!
For example, I won’t find my way into the trash and attempt to consume a giant wad of paper towels that were used to soak up frying oil, only to slink behind the couch and embarrassedly vomit it up. And if I found myself stuck in a bathroom, I would wait patiently until someone got home and ask them for some help. I would not, under any circumstances, try to EAT MY WAY OUT, causing enough damage so that both the door and the trim need to be replaced, and giving myself a pretty rough tummy ache along the way. Another point in my favor: I understand the utility of pills as well as the ease with which they can be taken. They don’t need to be hidden in cheese or loaded into a little plastic contraption to be shot deep into my throat in order to induce swallowing. I just take them!
And yet, even as I type these gloating words, I’m sitting in a rickety wooden chair, leaning awkwardly over my laptop. Unlike the damage of a few too many donuts or a bit too much coffee, I won’t feel the effects of my bad poor posture for many years. And yet, I know this, but I do nothing to correct it.
In a way, poor posture is like the human version of eating out of the garbage. We just can’t help it. Instead of taste-testing rotten meat or chewing on plastic bags, we hunch. And just as pets need help learning what they should and should not do, often for their own good, so do we.
That’s where this this Posture PT Confidence Corrector comes in. It can fit onto just about any chair–from office chairs to the driver’s seat of your car–and it improves posture, which in turn strengthens your core and reduces lower back and shoulder pain. Or, to put it differently, it’s not unlike a spray that makes bad posture smell like sour apples!
Okay, that’s going a little overboard with the pet metaphor thing. It’s not a spray. It’s a posture corrector. Sorry for the confusion. Now buy one, and straighten out your life. Got it?"	0.05			2018-10-02T04:00:03.835Z	0.31486252125742953	0.93	62431

Today’s sale leaves us conflicted. On the one hand, this would seem like an Order/Hoarder sale: you’re given options, some more reasonable than others. On the other, it’s not exactly the same as past Order/Hoarder sales we’ve offered. For example, there are more than two options. So, if you don’t mind, we thought we could work through this together, with a little Q&A:
How does the math break down?
This is a little more complicated than usual. You can get a 40 pack of basic fidget spinners for $14 ($0.35/spinner) or a 40 pack of LED fidget spinners for $16 ($0.40/spinner). But you could also get a 160 pack of both LED and basic fidget spinners (an 80 and 80 split) for $34. Which is about $0.21 per spinner… except, if you think about it: the first 40 basic spinners cost $14 and the first 40 LED spinners cost $16, which adds up to $30. So that’s a mere $4 for the last 80 fidget spinners, or a nickel per! CRAZY!
So then why wouldn’t this be an Order/Hoarder sale?
For three reasons:


As mentioned above, it’s not an either/or. There are three options.


40 fidget spinners will already have you well on your way to hoarding fidget spinners; but, more importantly…

Because fidget spinners are fun and will last longer. Also, this site is run by someone from Saint Louis where some people give out jokes instead of chocolate, so it’s kind of on brand for us to eschew the national standard for Halloween practices.
Wait, back up: what even ARE fidget spinners?
They’re goofy little spinny toys with no real purpose other then to be fidgeted with.
That’s sorta dumb, isn’t it?
You might think so, but in a world where people try to sell peppermint-scented oil as an alternative to physical therapy, I find it refreshing that there’s a product out there that’s explicitly for useless goofings-off.
Hey: fidget spinners. Halloween. Did I see that on the forum?! Is this the third day in a row that you’ve sold something someone suggested you sell, after making a big show about how you don’t take requests on Saturday??

Okay, so, we know how this looks: we go on a rant yesterday about how you can’t just post on the forums and get us to sell whatever you want… then the next day we sell exactly what you’ve been posting about on the forums. Doesn’t really help us reinforce our standing as definitely-not-pushovers.
But really, we’re trying to teach you a lesson. Because you may think that this is what you want, but are you sure? Like, are you REALLY sure?
You might think you want a shirt. And you might purchase one of these–showing the Meh or the Mediocre logo in glossy black ink on a black shirt, a “stealth” logo, if you will–and you might feel satisfied. You might feel a surge of something each time you put it on, a warmth rising in you that you will recognize as not just comfort… but comfort mixed with a sense victory.
You might wear the shirt proudly at first: to work, or out to grab drinks with friends, or when you’re on vacation, or when you’re visiting family. The people around you might ask, “Who made that shirt?” And you might respond: “Meh.” But really, you’ll want to say: “Me. I made it. Or I made it possible. Because had I not badgered them, had I not joined forces with @reclaimercube, the great bringer of the brush, there is a chance–nay, there is a certainty–that they never would have sold this or any shirt ever again.” And you might beam inwardly to yourself.
But many years from now–long after the shirt has got through the cycle: from wear-it-whenever-you-can, to wear-it-sometimes, to laundry-day-only, to pajama-top, to lawn-mowing-shirt, to rag, and finally to trash–you might be driving down a desolate midwestern highway, listening to a true-crime podcast, and you might suddenly remember: all the time you spent on a deal-a-day site’s forum rallying to spend ten dollars on some silly shirt. And you will wonder to yourself: was it really worth all that effort?
And knowing you people, you’ll be like: HELL YEAH! And that’s why we love you.

On September 13th, user @djslack offered up a list of potential things we could sell, including “some kind of interesting jerky type product.” And so here we are selling delicious Wicked Cutz jerky!
Now, we need to make two things clear:
First, this is some pretty classy jerky. Therefore, the price tag isn’t going to be exactly in line with the Slim Jim that you buy on a whim as you check out at the grocery store, only to open it in your car and for the noxious smell to make you regret your decision, although not enough to stop you from eating it. Hypothetically speaking. Point is: this is good jerky and good jerky costs money.
Second, and more importantly: we need to make something EXCEEDINGLY clear. We saw @djslack’s suggestion and considered it, but the decision to sell the jerky ultimately came down to us and us alone. In fact, there’s a chance that we subconsciously were thinking about selling jerky and so @djslack didn’t exactly give us the idea as much as surface it.
What we’re saying is: we’re not necessarily in the business of outsourcing our product selection. As in, we don’t do requests. As in, don’t get used to this, okay? Because this is it. The party ends here.
We say this because ever since we sold some toothbrushes as a joke–that’s right, it was a joke! A joke ON YOU!–we know there have been rumblings on the forums about something you’d like us to sell. That’s how obstinate we are, people: we won’t even name the item. We won’t even write the word. Because we are unmovable.
We’re like a brick wall. People always tell us that. They say, “Talking to you all is like talking to a brick wall.” Which we take as a compliment concerning our strength. And also our attractiveness, given that brick is a very beautiful building material. In certain cases, at least. Maybe not in some of the suburban architecture of the mid-fifties. But then again, those homes have a certain nostalgic beauty in a way. There’s a pure American warmth to them, isn’t there?
What were we talking about? Right: how we’re not a bunch of pushovers, and you can’t boss us around and tell us what to sell!

No, we’re talking about going even further towards singularity. Not just one deal each day. One entire new site selling only one thing per day.
Here’s how it would work if we were launching today. The site would no longer be called Meh. Instead, it would be called something like FLASH! Or, maybe, ILLUMINATR. We’d have a video about flashlights, perhaps a podcast interviewing flashlight experts on the ins-and-outs of responsible flashlight ownership, and then a lengthy write-up explaining the different scenarios in which you might use a telescoping light with a strong magnet, a small cree light with an adjustable beam, and a solar powered light.
There’d be a new logo each day, and more importantly a new URL.

As well as new hires.
Because we would essentially need to build an entirely new team, wouldn’t we? Otherwise, it’d just be a gimmick. And besides, I don’t want a flashlight expert telling me about trowels or copper pans or robot vacuum cleaners. No, we’d have to start from scratch every day. And in the event that something sells out, we’d probably have to have another site. A site of nothing. A sort of meditative anti-consumerism zen space with no purpose aside the absence of all shopping. Which would also need a whole new staff. That would need to be hired midday and let go by the next morning…

Dearest Professor Alba,
First off, a hearty congratulations on winning the Henning Prize. Your self-adhering bow-tie is certainly a masterwork, and the award is absolutely deserved. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the ceremony. As I am sure you are aware, since my expulsion, you are my sole correspondent from the Meyer Institute of Alchemic Fashion. But my choice not to attend is not due to some fear of seeing my former classmates and teachers again–or, more accurately, of experiencing their fear as they witness me. No, I cannot attend because I have fallen ill, and I fear this may be the last letter I ever write.
Although, perhaps ‘fallen ill’ is a simplification, as the illness under which I suffer has no name.
The trouble began in my makeshift lab late one night. I was working on a new stitch technique, making minor tweaks to it here and there over the course of several weeks. It was going nowhere, and after one particularly long day toiling in the haberdashery (with no Meyer Certification, I am forced to do such menial labor), I came home so exhausted and angry that I decided to throw it all away in favor of something entirely new.
I am sure you will be disappointed to hear this. During my expulsion hearings, you were the strongest voice in my favor. When the administration said that I “endangered” all those around me with the “diabolical recklessness” of my work, you told them it was just a phase. But Professor Alba, it was not. And while I am not proud to admit that, I am also not exactly not proud either.
For that evening, in my lab, I created something amazing: a stitch unlike any other stitch; a stitch that seemed to take time into it, that seemed to steal tiny slivers of the universe’s fabric and convert them into pure style. It was a stitch that resembled a stitch in only an ethereal way, like a word in another language whose definition we can on some level understand but for which there is no direct translation. I sewed up some pairs of socks with the stitch; despite using bland monochrome fabrics, each pair came out patterned with a bold unpredictable design.
I learned all too late that it was taking something from me as well, that it was essentially draining my life energy, weaving it among each sock’s seams. I fashioned a lead coat to wear while working, but it was too late. The damage has been done. I write this letter to you from bed, Professor Alba, a bed from which I fear I may never again rise. Indeed, just the act of writing has left me pale and exhausted.
But this is not a letter merely bidding farewell to you and this world. You will find, in the envelope, the detailed plans for the aforementioned stitch (as well as for the protective coat). I cannot say what I want for you to do with them. Some days I hope you will set them aflame and think of them no more; other days I hope you will use them to start a line of vibrant and delightful socks to sell around the world.
But, Professor Alba, promise me this: if you choose the latter, make sure to warn the people, to let them know the truth, that these are not simply stitched socks.
With Eternal Gratitude,

Step 3: Apply blanket to lap and/or legs.
Step 4: Apply purring cat to blanket at lap area. Pet cat occasionally.
Step 5: Apply hand to remote; locate a binge-worthy show on your television; press play.
Step 6: When your significant other or roommate enters the room and asks if you’re really going to spend all day just sitting there watching television, sigh and say, “You’re right,” then move (very slightly) to get up, stopping only to hiss with pain and grasp at the injury area where the first aid was administered. (Optional: parlay sympathy, if shown, into your significant other or roommate bringing you a hot beverage of your choice: coffee, tea, cocoa, or apple cider.)
Step 7: When your significant other or roommate leaves the room, replace purring cat (if riled by your attempt to get up), rewind show as needed, and resume viewing.

Overview: Very good, but not as good as Michael Keaton!!!
Before I get into my review, I want to give you a little bit of background: I’m a huge Michael Keaton fan and a software developer. Recently, I sold my start-up to a large tech conglomerate for several million dollars. I used that money to build a bunker inside an abandoned warehouse where I would live and wait for Michael Keaton to arrive so I can ask him a few continuity-related questions about his seminal 1996 comedy, Multiplicity, for my podcast: The Podkeast. I won’t list the questions here because I am certain they’ve never been asked and I want to be sure I’m the ones who asks them (more on this below, when I get into the complaints).
I need peace in my bunker to record episodes of The Podkeast and also to meditate and prepare myself for the eventual interview. Luckily, it’s soundproof. That brought up another issue, though: if I can’t hear anything, how will I know when Mike (that’s what I call him in my head sometimes) has arrived?
That’s where The Lynx 1080P Camera comes in! The quality’s great, they’re easy to set up, there’s free cloud storage, and most importantly, it has facial recognition. Using photos, I trained mine to only recognize one face: Michael Keaton’s. Thus, I’ll get a check-in notification whenever he arrives (fingers crossed, any day now!). Any other unfamiliar face alerts that come through I just ignore, because like I said, I don’t need the distractions.
I should say: I do have two complaints. One is that the Lynx recognizes faces really well, but not always the material said faces are made of. What I’m getting at is that my mom keeps showing up in a really realistic Michael Keaton mask (she probably bought it with the start-up money I gave her, ugh!). She always says the same thing: that she’s worried I might be losing my mind. It makes me want to scream. Like, of course I’m losing my mind! I got a check-in notification and thought Michael Friggin’ Keaton was here! And sometimes I do scream. Hey, it’s a sound-proof bunker, gotta get your money’s worth, right?
The other complaint I have is that Michael Keaton has not shown up to do the interview with me. This is probably more a don’t-have-Michael-Keaton’s-contact-info problem than a Lynx problem, but still: with that AND the mask issue, I didn’t feel right giving it five stars.
Overall, though, a very good camera!"	0.05			2018-09-24T04:00:11.601Z	0.2044531578210335	0.94	74861

When it comes to celebrating milestones, different people demand different amounts of ceremony. Some will require you to wear tuxedos and dinner gowns to the their wedding in a restored factory-turned-theater-space, wherein they will prepare a choreographed song and dance commemorating the various defining moments of their relationship. Others will go to the courthouse, sign a few documents, and send a text imploring you to meet them for beers later.
Whether it be a birthday, a successful defense of a PhD dissertation, or a housewarming party–everyone’s a little different. Not everyone wants gifts. But herein lies the one consistent rule, regardless of an event’s formality: if you’re bringing a gift, you have to put it in something festive. Because even the most casual soon-to-be mom isn’t going to stoked when you show up with a onesie still in the shipping box from VintageOnsiesRUs․com.
The problem? Wrapping is stressful. Wrap a gift poorly and you look like a degenerate. Wrap a gift too ornately and you seem like a bit of an over-achiever. Besides, not everything is easy to wrap. If you want to wrap an overstuffed plush starfish, you can either a) put it in a box and wrap that, or b) get your friend who’s an aerospace engineer to help you get the measurements and scissor placement just right so that it doesn’t come out looking like garbage.
Really, your best bet is to put that overstuffed plush starfish into a gift bag. Because the gift bag always looks good. It’s as fun-looking as wrapping paper and as easy as a shipping box. Plus, getting a gift in a gift bag rules. You’re basically getting two gifts, one of which you’re more than encouraged to regift later when you need to give someone else a gift.

For those are unfamiliar, Order/Hoarder is when we offer you two options: a normal number of things for a good price, or an abnormally large number of things for a GREAT price. Today’s product:
Cooling towels!!!
So, let’s break it down:
The Math
“You can’t put a price on cool.” That’s something someone said in a movie once. It doesn’t matter who or what movie or if I just made it up, because it’s not true. You can put a price on being cool.
For example, if you just want to be double-cool (as in, get two cooling towels) you have to pay $12. That comes down to the totally reasonable per towel price of $6 (especially considering they’re $10 over on Amazon).
Now, here’s where it gets a bit more complicated. As we like to point out on these sales, when figuring out the price per unit of the Hoarder order, it’s not as simple as dividing the overall price ($36) by the number of units (12). BECAUSE, your can choose either 2 or 12, no in-betweens. Therefore, if you think about it, you’re already paying $6 for each of the first 2 towels, which means the last 10 towels are only costing you $24, or a mere $2.40 per towel! How about that deal, huh?!
What you can do with a normal order
It’s pretty simple. Cooling towels are not exactly all that, well, cool, but they are functional. With just two of them, you can use one as your main post-workout cool-down towel, and give the other to your spouse or partner. Or you can cycle through both yourself so you don’t have to do laundry as often.
What can you do with a Hoarder order
So much more! Here are just a few suggestions:


Go a day early and leave a cooling towel at each mile marker of your upcoming 20K race, so you never have to worry about getting too hot.


Take all of them and fashion them into a suit or cocktail dress to wear to outdoor weddings. But would a suit or dress made out of cooling towels really be classy enough for something like that? you might ask. To which we would respond: Could it be any less classy than a suit or dress soaked with sweat?


Sure, you could spend a bunch of money on an air conditioner and then a bunch of more money each month to run it. Or, you could save some cash by sewing yourself a delightful cooling towel quilt!


They’d make a great napkin alternative at your 12-guest “super spicy food banquet”.


Are you a do-gooder teen? Do you often dream of fashioning rope ladders out of clothes and blankets to lower yourself out your 2nd story bedroom window so you can run around after bedtime with your new rebellious friends? Only, your palms get so sweaty that you can’t get a good grip? Gosh, if only you could make a rope ladder out of something cool and soothing to the touch!


See? Maybe we were wrong. Maybe 12 cooling towels isn’t an unreasonable amount of cooling towels at all. On the other hand, you still have the option of buying the (completely boring) 2-pack. The decision is yours!
So what’s it gonna be? Are you going to place an order? Or become a hoarder?"	0.06			2018-09-22T04:00:05.871Z	0.20048520789810637	0.96	62757

Generally, we don’t support the silencing of artists. Except here, where you can use Karaoke Creator to suppress the vocal frequencies of a song (and shift the key) so one of your friends can do a much shittier rendition of it.
Crossfader lets you transition seamlessly from one song to the next.
It also has something called “Party Thruster” which involves sliding a “throttle” that allows you to “hear the party build up until you hit maximum party at which time the system booms and the lights go crazy.”

We have no complaints about this LG Hi-Fi Entertainment & Karaoke System.
Honestly, it seems pretty cool. With 1000 watts, it’s got plenty of power. Plus, it’s got a wide range of features that’ll help you “pump up the party” as the youth say. For example, the Crossfader allows you to blend songs together seamlessly. And the Karaoke Creator can suppress the vocals of a given track and then shift the key to one that better suits the karaoke singer.
It also has something called “Party Thruster” which allows you to “hear the party build up until you hit maximum party at which time the system booms and the lights go crazy.” If you’re unsure of what that means, maybe this, from the instruction manual, will help paint a clear picture:

Sounds like a pretty quick party if you ask me, but I’m told it happens to a lot of guys.
So again, we have no complaints about this particular karaoke system. Our complaint is about karaoke in general, or, to be more specific, about the musical artists we so often choose NOT to sing. That’s right: I’m talking about birds. Despite being nature’s original songwriters, you rarely hear anyone at a karaoke night sing a song by the many great bird-fronted musical groups out there, such as:

Oriole Speedwagon,
Cardi(nal) B,
Chirp Trick,
The Coo-Coo Dolls,
David Crowie,
Squawking Heads,
The Beaksie Boys,
The Sparrowling Stones,
Nine Finch Nails,
Pengwen Stefani,
Red Hot Chili Pipers,
Macawl McCartney,
Fowrener,
Kendrake Lamar,
The Flamingo Lips,
Ibis Markie,
Kelly Larkson,
Kingphisher,
or The Killers (of Worms & Field Mice).

It’s ridiculous, really! These are some of the greatest musicians to ever roam the skies, and they get no recognition. But you can change that. All you need to do is buy this LG Hi-Fi Entertainment & Karaoke System. Then, come your next karaoke party, make it a rule: only bird bands.

Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a child. Let’s call him @Dave. Dave wore Sears-brand Toughskin jeans. They were, as their name implied, durable and long-lasting. But, like most economically practical things, corners needed to be cut to keep them affordable, and, unfortunately for Dave, the corner Toughskin jeans cut was the let’s-make-these-things-look-cool corner.
Or maybe not unfortunately. Because Dave rarely felt self-conscious in his Toughskin jeans. What did make him feel self-conscious was when, in the mid-80s, his grandparents splurged and got him a Generra sweatshirt. It was “in.” Very “in.” In fact, you could say that it was so deeply “in” that the brand couldn’t find its way out of the decade.
Suddenly, all the other kids at school were stopping Dave in the hallway to say, “Cool sweatshirt,” and, after years of remaining invisible behind the Toughskin curtain, he didn’t know how to react to such a compliment. It was uncomfortable.
Dave has come a long way since then… or has he? No, he doesn’t wear Toughskin jeans anymore, but he still has a Toughskin mindset. He’s not afraid of bright purple laptops or speakers that are loud in both function and design. This, in some ways, is his calling: espousing the virtues of things that don’t look exactly like you’d hope but work just fine.
But he doesn’t exactly know what to do with these slick-looking Rowkin Bluetooth Ear Buds.
Does he say: just because Meh sells some stuff that has substance but lacks style does NOT mean the stylish stuff we sell lacks substance in equal measure? Does he point out that many of the negative reviews on Amazon that have driven the average rating down to an unimpressive 3 stars can be put into 3 categories:

people complaining about the hefty (non-Meh) price tag;
people who struggled with a weird issue that was corrected easily by a factory reset; and
people hating on Bluetooth technology as a whole?

Does he mention that many reviews were impressed with both their size and sound quality (and again, that those people were reviewing after, presumably, paying some 50 bucks more the price they are offered at here)?
No. @Dave does none of these things. He has a copywriter do it, duh."	0.05			2018-09-20T04:00:02.850Z	0.2538143856831479	0.92	72743

As we’ve mentioned before, we recently won an auction for a storage locker that was filled entirely with branded content romance novels. Or so we thought. But, picking through the titles, we actually found many belonged to a branded content epic fantasy series by the author L.L.R. Holdien about a warrior named Tarklaw The Powerful. Luckily for us, there’s a chapter in book 19 about today’s product, the Keysmart (and Keysmart Pro).

Having successfully freed the shape-shifting wizard Vintel, son of Filor The Great, from the floating prison of Delkabana, narrowly escaping the light-spears of the Meschlen Guards by leaping through a portal leading somewhere that only a seer like Wise Crin might intuit–Tarklaw found himself deposited into murky waist-high water.
“Vintel?” Tarklaw called out, trying to locate the wizard whom he had just a moment ago saved, despite their families’ centuries-long acrimonious relations.
“I’m right here, Tarklaw,” Vintel seemed to whisper into his ear, buzzingly. “As a shape-shifting wizard, it is my custom to acclimate my shape to the environs, and so I have taken the form a mosquito because we, bitter-family-enemy-turned-savior, appear to be in a swamp.”
“Not just any swamp! The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors!” came a voice that belonged neither to Tarklaw or Vintel, but another in their vicinity. Tarklaw turned quickly, drawing his great sword with a shing sound common of sword-drawing. But he found only a small creature not unlike an unshelled tortoise, swimming towards them. “Forgive me for startling you! I am Rewn, peaceful leader of the Melorians, the primary inhabitants of this swamp at the edge of the Planet Glor at the far reaches of the Heplan Galaxy. Now, I imagine you’ve come here through some pesky portal or other, but fear not: your exit is easily made through one of the Eight Astounding Doors.”
“Doors?” Said Tarklaw. “I am from the planet Phentalon, a place without doors, due to our peoples’ openness with each other.”
“Very noble,” Rewn said. “Perhaps one day, The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors shall be like that. For now, you must choose one. They go to any number of worlds, from the euphorically beautiful mountain-scape of Relan to the hellish fire-deserts of Dumask. And we have all the keys right here…” Rewn dipped under the water for a moment, but re-emerged with a perplexed look upon his creaturely face. “Oh, dear! They were right there a moment ago.”
“You simply allow all keys to be strewn throughout a swamp?” buzzed Vintel.
“Not exactly,” Rewn said, explanatorily. “We keep them all together using an ingenious contraption known as a KeySmart. Made of aircraft aluminum, it can hold eight keys–or as many as fourteen, with an expansion pack! Additionally, it includes a loop for keys belonging to vehicles propelled by motors. Not to mention, its extended frame can hold long or foreign keys, which is especially important to us, as one of our oldest and most prized keys is made from the hollow bird-like finger bone of the fallen Hilderan Mage Lazlorn.”
“But,” Vintel buzzed, contrarily, “as ingenious and organizationally optimized as that all sounds, it seems at present not to be helping in your ability to locate them.”
“Ah, yes, that would be true if it were the base model, which is still good,” Rewn said. “Luckily for us, we opted for the Pro. Not only does it have a built-in LED flashlight and bottle opener; it can also show a map of your missing keys, and by way of the Tile app–which can be accessed via your smartphone or tablet–you can make your keys ring out loud! Of course, I should add at this juncture that the ‘water’ here in the The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors is different in elemental makeup to that of the water on other planets, such as Earth.”
“Are you saying,” Vintel buzzed, clarifyingly, “that just because we are discussing the KeySmart Pro being used in a water-based situation, it should not be taken as an endorsement of it being waterproof?”
“Exactly,” cried Rewn, disclaimingly.
“Much like doors, smartphones and tablets are concepts foreign to my home world,” Tarklaw said. “But that sounds like a great functional product nonetheless.”
“And I will show you just how functional it is!” Rewn cried with excitement. He brought forward a device and opened the Tile app. A moment later, a ding rang out, though it sounded muffled. The three of them turned… and stood facing a giant glowing snake-like beast. It emerged from the water, standing nearly forty Glorian theltans tall, or forty feet tall in Earth measurements, Glorian theltans being exactly equal to terrestrial feet. The ding sounded again, from somewhere deep inside of the monster’s abdomen.
“Oh no! A Mirelord! Run!” Rewn cried with fear. “Or, better yet, swim.” And with that, he disappeared under the water.
But Tarklaw did not swim away. He crouched into a combat ready position as best he could in the deep murky water. The Mirelord leaned closer to him, its eyes alight with evil.
“What are you doing?” buzzed Vintel into his ear, questioningly.
“We must get out of this swamp,” Tarklaw cried. “This is the only way. Though, it will be hard for just the two of us to defeat it…”
“Perhaps, I can help?” came a distinguished voice from Tarklaw’s side.
Tarklaw turned, and saw… no! He couldn’t believe it! “Hinton, son of Raquille, wielder of The Great Axe Of Orlagos, and best friend since birth of Tarklaw The Powerful? But I thought you were–”
“The immortal prisoner of the Inter-dimensional Pirate Lop, locked away in the his ship, The Pummeling Ewlok, for all of eternity?” Hinton laughed. “Not a chance in Dumask, my friend! Now, what do you say we free the aforementioned product from the belly of the beast? Just like old times?”
Tarklaw couldn’t help but smile. “Just like old times, indeed,” he said, and they raised their weapons to the approaching Mirelord."	0.05			2018-09-19T04:00:10.856Z	0.34612555704581827	0.93	72268

One time, I left without remembering to close the door.
I was living in a house somewhere so rural we didn’t need to lock up, and, in a rush to leave (I was going on a trip), I forgot to swing the door all the way closed, leaving only the screen door between my cat and freedom. He was fine. My mom checked on him the next day and, much to her surprise, he emerged from under the deck after spending what must’ve been, for an indoor cat, a terrifying night outside.
Just about every time I have left the house since then, even if just for an hour, I have wondered: “did I close the door? Did I lock the door? Do the pets have food? Do they have water? Did I leave the oven on? Did I unconsciously light seven candles and place them precariously close to window curtains that are, unbeknownst to me, highly flammable?” Many times, I have gone back to check. Never have I left the stove on. Never have I found candles flickering. The pets have always been fine. Only once or twice have I found the door unlocked.
Still, I never regret it, because it’s nicer to know everything’s fine than it is to hope everything’s fine.
And that’s really what these Zmodo MeShare cameras are for: making sure. You can call them “security cameras,” but that feels a little overstated. Maybe it would be better to rebrand them as “check-in cameras.” After all, the chances that you’re going to tune in as your home is being burglarized–thus allowing you to call the authorities while the burglary is in progress–is very low. I mean, hell, the actual likeliness of your home being burglarized at all is very low. And if your first thought upon reading that is, Nuh-uh, my home gets broken into all the time, we won’t argue with you. But we will say: you probably need more than a couple Zmodos.
Otherwise, these are a good option for the second-guessers out there to quell all the concerns that might flare up during your day at work: whether you just want to make sure everything’s fine, or to check that you didn’t forget to close the windows, or to monitor whether your dog is feeling okay after eating something stupid that he wasn’t supposed to…

Every time they sit down they’ll think, “Hey, you know what: I’m special!” And this confidence will push them to do great things.
Game Room

Checkers is simple and boring on a board… but what about in a room, with you and all of your friends as the pieces? To make it more exciting: institute a rule where it’s not as easy as just “jumping” another piece; instead, you have to battle for it. Whoever doesn’t get cast into one of the empty spaces (i.e. onto the floor) wins!

Think about it: you cover the floor of your kitchen, wall-to-wall, with Sactionals, and now, suddenly, you can drop a glass or a ceramic mug and it won’t shatter! Plus, they’re machine washable, in case there’s a spill. Best of all, if you need to keep an eye on something you’ve got baking, you can just lay down next to the oven and watch it!

Dear @reclaimercube,
On September 2nd, you posted the following comment on a knife sale:

Meh I have anxiously been awaiting for you to post a toothbrush for sale again. I will post this everyday until you finally sell another one again.

And, @reclaimercube, can we tell you something? We’re very proud of you. Because you kept your word. Since then, each day, you’ve put forward this same request.
Your fellow Meh customers began to notice. One post from Friday, September 7th sparked a discussion that involved more than 20 comments. In that conversation, someone pointed out a toothbrush for sale on a competitor’s site. You, ever strong, refused to take the bait:

not a bad deal… But not on meh so it doesn’t matter. You could link me to colgate’s website or crest’s website for a free toothbrush and I still wouldn’t want it unless it was on meh. I’m chaining myself to this statue. Ride or die mehbrother.

Your repeated request did not specify why you wanted a toothbrush, or what kind of toothbrush you wanted. Really, you haven’t even promised that you’d buy the toothbrush. You’ve only asked, repeatedly, for us to “post a toothbrush.”
Well, good news, @reclaimercube: when we launched Meh, we made a decision. Once, and only once, we would allow a Meh customer to dictate exactly what we’d sell. The only rule was they had to make the request for 13 consecutive days. They could ask for $1 MacBooks, or free puppies, or Cadillac Escalades filled with cash. It didn’t matter. There were no restrictions, aside from the 13 days. Some of us worried the financial hit would be too much, but others felt assured: we could trust our customers! They wouldn’t make unreasonable demands!
So thank you, @reclaimercube; you’ve shown us that our faith was not misplaced. Now, Meh community, let’s all come together and celebrate with this build-your-own-bundle of toothbrushes.

Hair: it is the ultimate example of disobedience.
You can train puppies to pee outside, to walk next to you, to sit, to shake, to do any number of fun and/or useful things. With cats, the job is much harder, but with some persistence (and a spray bottle) it is possible to enforce a few rules: you do not yowl in the middle of the night, you do not walk on the kitchen counter, you do not knock our decorative trinkets off the mantle as a game. Even a bonsai can be coaxed, over time, to grow a certain way.
But not hair. Nope, no matter how many times you comb, shave, style, epilate, and wax: it can just never take the fucking hint!
You know that person in your  your life who’s like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “hmm, maybe?” And you hope they’ll just drop it, but then a day later, they’re like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “I don’t know if that dumb thing is really a good idea.” Which should be clear as hell, but they don’t want to listen, so they keep prodding and prodding until you’re like, “Look,  I don’t want to do the dumb thing because it is dumb, and honestly, I’m worried you might be dumb for suggesting it, and I might be dumb for being the friend of such a dumb person.” And you feel terrible but they just smile and say, “C’mon! It’ll be great!”
That’s hair. No matter how many times you try to send the message that you don’t want it to come back there, it keeps coming back there. It is untrainable!
Or is that the wrong way to look at it? Could it be that we are the untrainable ones? That our hair is not being a stubborn learner but a tenacious teacher? That it wants to lead us to a better place? A place where we eschew the standards of beauty thrust upon us? Because isn’t it pretty arbitrary where we say there should be hair and where we say there should not? On the head is good, but not on the face? Except some faces capable of growing thick enough hair? On the chest is okay, but no, never on the back? Not on the legs, but okay on the arms, except in the armpits? Could it be that our hair’s persistence is its way of saying: you need to get the hell over it and just be who you are?

The three brothers had been cleaning out their grandfather’s basement for nearly two hours before they found the FoodSaver.
“What’s this?” said Kyle, holding it up.
“Looks old,” said Jake. “I’d guess circa second half of the 2010’s.”
Terry took it from Kyle and inspected it. “Wait, I know these things. It’s an early model weed-sealer. You know? The devices for vacuum-packing weed so it wouldn’t go bad.”
“All this talk of weed remind me, have you guys taken your three o’clock edibles yet?” Jake asked.
Kyle and Terry nodded.
“But wait,” Kyle said, “why does it say FoodSaver on it, if it’s for weed?”
“You have to understand, Kyle, this was before weed was legal everywhere,” Terry explained. “They didn’t even put it in the water back then!”
Kyle looked at the FoodSaver perplexed. “Really?”
“I’m serious,” Terry said. “So people weren’t as acclimated to it as we are now. They considered it a drug. Thus, when people took some, they got ‘high,’ which basically meant they thought without logic. So it’s likely that the inventor of the ‘FoodSaver’ only named it such because he was super high, and probably pretty hungry.”
“So strange to think that the same substance that keeps us calm and measured, used to have almost the opposite effect!” Kyle said.
Now Jake had the FoodSaver. “Are you sure this is a weed-sealer? To me, it looks like an early sous-vide-assistant. That would make more sense with the FoodSaver name.”
“Did they even sous vide back then?” Terry asked.
“Sure,” Jake said. “It was more of a luxury, though, given that it was before the Microwave And Oven Act of 2035.”
“When I read about those times, and all the negative-energy-pollution caused by those now illegal kitchen appliances, it just makes me sick,” Terry said.
“Guys, you’ve got me thinking…” Kyle paused to gather his thoughts. “Well, you know how when we put stuff in the freezer, it just freezes together and gets covered in weird ice?”
“They’re called water diamonds, Kyle,” Terry said.
“They mean the moisture has accepted the food, so we know it’s safe to eat,” Jake said.
“I’m well aware of them and what they mean. Don’t forget, I’m the one who studied health at Dove For Men Presents: College. But I was thinking, the food doesn’t always taste good after the water diamonds form.” Kyle took the FoodSaver from Jake. “And I know this is going to sound crazy, but if this thing could keep weed fresh, and be used with food products for sous-vide purposes, maybe we could combine the two functions. Like, we could use it to seal food before we freeze it so it stays fresher longer.”
“You mean, you want to eat food that’s been frozen but hasn’t emitted its proper water diamonds?” Terry said.
“Isn’t that illegal?” Jake added.
“Sure, on Earth. But not here,” Kyle said, “on Mars.”
Jake and Terry had to admit he had a point: they definitely had been on Mars this whole time."	0.05			2018-09-13T04:00:05.184Z	0.21097046413502127	0.92	62121

As someone who doesn’t brush his hair much, Wet Brushes look, to me, like normal brushes. But looks can be deceiving. Or, in this case, the looks are deceivingly simple. In truth, everything I’ve read about them states, quite simply, that they’re best brushes around. And today, we’re selling a pack of three: one pro, one pop fold, and one paddle.
They’re all designed specifically to brush out tangles without pain or tugging. They work especially well on wet hair, but can be used on dry hair too, even wigs and extensions. The paddle features “AquaVents” that help with ventilation and drying as you brush. In short, they sound great. But again, I don’t brush my hair really ever, so if you don’t want to take my word for it–or the word of the many happy customers over on Amazon–then maybe these totally real reviews from absolutely not-made-up hair professionals will help seal the deal:

“Great brushes,” says Hairrison Ford.
“I love mine,” says Braid Pitt.
“The best,” says Julia Stylist.
“Top shelf stuff,” says David Mulletterman.
“My favorite,” says Follicle․i․am.
“Excellent products,” says Scarlet Johansbun.
“The only name I trust,” says David Sprayed.
“Fantastic value,” says Gel-ly Clarkson.
“Just awesome,” says K.D. Bang(s).
“Use mine every day,” says Partin’ Lawrence.
“Why get the rest when you can have the best?” says Pompadoris Burke.
“Bloody good stuff,” says Hairy Styles.
“A triumph in brush-making,” says Kate Brush.
“One thumb up, because I’m using my other thumb to hold a Wet Brush,” says Ethan MoHawke.
“Hands down, the greatest,” says Mariah Hair-Carey.
“Hot take: they’re amazing,” says James Comby, former director of the FBI (Federal Bureau of Interesting-Hair-Styles).

The Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet is pretty simple: it’s a wallet that comes with a powerpack, which can be used to charge your phone or other devices.
In a way, to recharge something is to refill it, but unfortunately, while the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet does fill your wallet in the literal sense–like, there is a powerpack inside of it–it can’t refill your wallet in the figurative sense–as in, recharge your bank account.
Or can it?
Because think about this: what kind of phone is the most likely to have a short battery life? An old phone! And maybe you have an upgrade waiting for you, but you don’t want to dish out the money for one. Because maybe, with your provider, it’s not as simple as handing over $200 and getting a new iPhone. Now, you pay for the upgrade via a small increase in your monthly bill–a small increase that over time accumulates into a lot of money. And it’s very possible that this change was made because people like you: people who buy a phone and then ride it into the ground, thus spending a couple hundred bucks every six years, rather than evert two like your cell company–let’s call them Werizon–would prefer.
And so now you’ve got a geriatric phone that needs a pick-me-up every few hours to make it through the day, and you’re not always near an outlet, so one of these Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallets–‘wallets’ plural because you get a 2-pack–is just what you need. It’s your wallet, so it’s not like you’ll forget it. Thus, you’ll always have some charge on hand, which means you don’t need to upgrade, which means your phone bill won’t go up, which means you’ll save money, which, in conclusion, means the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet can, in fact, recharge both your phone and your wallet!

I remember being a kid, riding in my parents’ car at night, and dropping something. Maybe a toy or a quarter. It doesn’t matter what. What matters is I reached up and turned on the dome light to find the object in question. And it was then that my dad freaked the fuck out. You would’ve thought I’d tossed hot acid in his eyes. “Turn that off! I can’t see anything!” he claimed. He might’ve even swerved a little, for emphasis. As a dutiful child, I switched the light off as quickly as possible to avoid careening off the road into a ditch.
Flash forward some years: I have a license. I have a car. A friend is riding with me. He turns on the dome light for something and… everything is fine.
The same thing happened the first time I helped jumpstart a car. I’d been told so many times about everything that can go terribly wrong that I felt sure that it would end in a) an deadly storm of electricity and fire; or b) one or both of the cars being fried for good. Turns out, if you, ya know, just follow instructions, it works out fine.
If anything, the greatest risk of jumping a car–the one that no amount of how-to articles or Youtube videos can save you from–is the risk of wasting a favor. Because think about it: you spend all that time being a good friend and building up positive equity until you’ve almost got enough to cash in for pet care or help shlepping some furniture from your old apartment to your new one… Then your car battery farts out and now your buddy is driving over in the cold to help you get it started again.
That’s where this iJoy Jump Starter Kit comes in. Not only will it charge your phone and provide some you with some light; it’ll make it so that you don’t need to dip into the favor bank just to get your car running.

Roy laughed. Not at the man but at the theory the honk had charitably eradicated from his mind. Lorraine couldn’t be the Scarlet Savior. Sure, they both had striking red hair, but the Scarlet Savior always wore a matching Treasure Island jewelry set–one necklace, one bracelet, both made out of genuine gemstones and pearls–whereas Lorraine wore a single longer Treasure Island necklace, which was also made of genuine gemstones and pearls.
Well, that settles that! Roy thought. And just in time too! Because here she came, the Scarlet Savior, flying through the sky, blazing a red path through the sky that, strangely, looked like it originated on the roof of the Gazette’s offices.

For those keeping score at home: that’s now a $9 difference between the two.
In some ways, this isn’t simply a sale; it’s an experiment. We want to answer the question: what is a zipper truly worth?

There are three potential outcomes to buying this Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk:
Outcome 1
You buy the standing desk. You’re intrigued by its promises of a stronger core, healthier circulation, improved productivity, and better posture. But the truth is, you don’t care for it. You’ve spent your entire life believing that getting work done requires sitting down and shutting up. So how do you expect, as an adult, to change your working position? Maybe if you gave it more time… but you don’t want to. You just want to use it as a normal desk. And that’s fine! Because this thing didn’t cost north of $600 like some models out there; it cost less than $200. And look, that’s not nothing, but it was a worthwhile gamble.
Outcome 2
You love your new standing desk. But it’s not enough. Once you taste the thrill of working upright, you want more. You quickly replace your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk with a treadmill desk. You start out walking, but soon enough you’re outright sprinting while you manage your spreadsheets and respond to emails. You get a kiddy pool and set it up behind the treadmill, filling it with a medley of pirañas and water moccasins. Now, any slowdown and you’re in trouble. But even that’s not enough. You take out the water moccasins, extract their venom, and put it in an IV that runs directly into your arm. The anti-venom is in another IV that you’ve rigged to only administer as you meet your hourly sales goals. Your friends and family members are worried about you, but you’ve never felt more alive! And it all started with the Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk!
Outcome 3
You get your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk, and you like it. You crank it up to standing height for a few hours of the day; for the rest of the time, you use it as a normal desk. You’re neither disappointed, nor unsatisfied. It meets your needs, and you will use it for the foreseeable future.

Shaving is the blandest and yet most grueling task of every personal grooming regimen. It is a zero sum game: you can put it off, but that only means it’ll be a longer and more grueling process when eventually you do get around to it. It’s like mowing the lawn, except without the exercise, and the smell of fresh cut grass replaced by the noxious chemical odor of shave gel. In short, it’s miserable.
Or it was. Until now. Enter these “Famous Maker” razors. Famous Maker? you say. But who IS the famous maker? That’s just the thing, we can’t tell you. And now suddenly, shaving is an act of immeasurable mystery and excitement!
Could it be that these razors are the excess produced by an underground razor factory located far below Park City? Perhaps for the original purpose of being distributed, in secret, to the agents and publicists and personal assistants of actors in town for the Sundance Film Festival? So that these various agents and publicists and assistants could sneak into the actors’ hotel rooms at night and shave their faces clean while they slept? Because maybe the actors, having escaped the always-on environs of Los Angeles, wanted to let themselves go, but the various men and women whose livelihoods relied on their pristine image had other things in mind?
Or could it be that the razors are from a different hidden factory, a facility built into the side of one of the Alps? For a baron? A baron who volunteered to host the worldwide beard and mustache contest at his expansive villa? While harboring a secret hatred of all facial hair? And so the plan was not to celebrate these growers of elaborate beards and mustaches, but to trap them and then use the razors to, as the baron said in a private correspondence, “reveal their cheeks upper lips once again to the world”? Maybe he even wanted to shave the hair on their head too, just to prove a point? Only his scheme was discovered by the lowly helper-boy tasked with taking his correspondence to the post office? And so the baron had no choice but to sell off his stock of razors in an effort to cut (pun intended) his losses?
Or could it be a pretty basic story of a razor company having some leftover razors that they wanted to offload? Only they couldn’t do so under their own name? Because then people would be like, “but wait, I just spent this much on these at the store, but now you’re selling them for cheap online? That’s bullshit!”?
Okay, for purposes of whimsy, let’s just ignore that last scenario. Instead, focus on the first two, buy these razors, and shave with an entirely new sense of intrigue!"	0.05			2018-09-05T04:00:15.298Z	0.26119278036366067	0.93	62903

The actors threw up their hands. The camera man shook his head. The boom operator brought the boom mic booming to the ground in disgust.
“What,” the director said, “is that infernal noise?”
“Sorry,” said the PA. “It’s my light. It ran out of battery so I had to crank it.”
“Didn’t I tell you to crank this morning, to make sure it had enough charge to light the scene?”
“Yeah, you did,” said the PA, “But, sir, I gotta be honest, I don’t think this is the right light for a film set. I mean, I could see the utility of having one at your house.

Can I level with you here: I’m just not much a knife guy. I have a set of good kitchen knives and that’s about it. I open boxes with my keys cut through frustrating packaging with a pair of scissors. I don’t mean any judgment. I’m just being honest. The problem is, I have to write about this knife, and I can’t just say, “Uh, I don’t know? It’s fine, probably?”
Or so I thought…
Then I went to do some research on Amazon and saw a question about what material was used to make the pivot washers and how thick the blade is. The first answer reads as follows:

Sorry, this was a gift for someone in Arizona so I can’t answer your question. I can only say that the knife is substantial!

Wait, seriously? This is allowed? Admitting that you don’t know the answer… counts as an answer?! Well then friends, I’ve got some great news: I can answer all the questions you have about this 2-Pack of C.R.K.T. Ruger Go-N-Heavy Compact VEFF Serrated Knives! Let’s do it!
So, how thick is the blade?
Great question! I’d guess that it’s probably about the same as other knives like it, although it could be thicker. But even then, it wouldn’t be too much thicker, because that would be weird, right?
I’m reading that it has a “stonewashed drop-point blade.” That sounds intense. What kind of stuff can you use it for?
I bet it would be pretty good at cutting through most stuff you’d use a knife like this for, but I don’t feel comfortable naming specific stuff because I’ve never used one. I will say this, though: there’s a good chance it can cut through butter. And an even better chance if the butter has been left out of the fridge for a little while.
Was it designed by Bill Harsey?
Sure was! As to who Bill Haresay is, lol, idk! I would venture to guess he does something in the knife industry.
One reviewer says that it is 11.8"" long when it’s extended. Is that longer than other knives?
Not sure. It is definitely not as long as a foot, because a foot is 12"". With that being said, another reviewer posted a photo of it next to another knife and a tape measurer, if that helps. It is bigger than the other knife, but not the tape measurer (which is good, because those things can get really long).
Wow! This is so easy! It’s great to finally realize how much a knife expert I really am! Thanks Amazon question answerer, for showing me the way.

This Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble may seem simple enough. It’s 6 100% ceramic products with matching designs: a toothbrush holder, a tumbler, a soap dish, a lotion dispenser, a tissue box, and a trash bin. None of these things require much explanation. What does deserve some attention, though, is the multi-stage process that one goes through when deciding to buy one or all of them. We’ve laid it out below:
Stage 1: Intrigue
These are interesting. The various pieces look stylish, and they all match. It might be nice to have a motif that really brings the entire bathroom together.
Stage 2: Skepticism
But do I really need any of these? The old coffee mug we put the toothbrushes in works just fine, as does the little wicker basket we’ve got for trash. The sink already has a built-in soap dish. This one would be easier to clean, but do you really need to clean something when all it does is hold soap? Isn’t soap itself essentially the concept of cleanliness made solid? Lotion bottles already come with a pump top and tissue boxes are their own tissue dispensers, really. Am I supposed to re-package things? Isn’t that adding unnecessary steps?
Stage 3: Re-evaluation
Yes, I guess technically it is adding unnecessary steps, but all in the service of style. And maybe that’s worth it. Which would maybe mean the steps aren’t unnecessary?
*Stage 4: Introspection
And what does it say about me that I’m so put off by these objectively simple tasks? Like, it isn’t hard to empty some lotion from one thing into another thing. It isn’t hard to put a box of tissues inside another box. Or clean a soap dish. Just like it isn’t hard to put a new bag in the garbage after I take the trash out. But I never do, not right away at least. I always wait hours, sometimes even a whole day, leaving paper towels and granola bar wrappers on the kitchen counter, until finally my desire for a clean surface outweighs my laziness. At which point I put a new bag in the garbage can and am reminded that the laziness was all to avoid something that takes mere seconds. And yet, when next I need to take out the trash, this process will repeat. Making matters worse: someday it might not just be taking out the trash. Someday it might be dirty diapers I’m dealing with. It might be taking kids to the doctor. It might taking the medication I need to stay alive. And when that time comes will I just attempt to put it off? I want to say no, that I’ll be past all of this by then, that I’ll finally be a responsible organized adult… but an I’m adult now, damnit! I should already be better than this!
Stage 5: Ascension
That’s it! No more! I’m going to buy every item in this Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble, not just because it’s stylish and will tie my bathroom together nicely! No, that’s all secondary. Really, I’m doing it to prove to everyone–but especially myself–that I’m capable of taking the right steps and building good habits! New me, here we come!
Stage 6: Regression
Purchase made! Now, it’s time for bed. Shit, wait? It’s trash day tomorrow, isn’t it? I should take the bin to the curb. Although, there really are only a couple bags in there. I’m sure I’d be fine until next week…"	0.07			2018-09-01T04:00:01.758Z	0.3734081588603498	0.94	49783

There’s an old saying about innovation: “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.” It is derived from an Emerson quote that reads: “If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.” In this way, the saying is an example of itself; the ‘mousetrap’ variant is shorter, snappier, and conveys the exact same meaning, thus it is the one most often used.
The implication here is basically if you build it, they will come: you’ll have lines around the block, people from all over frantically waving their bills in the air demanding the latest in mouse-entrapment technology.
The truth, we know now, is a bit different.
The world, upon beating a path to your door, would say, “This mousetrap is smaller and more humane than the previous mousetrap, but now I’ve decided I want a mousetrap that is smaller and more humane.” Or, “I have no mice in my house, but many spiders, and this mousetrap did not catch a single spider, which is a bit of a disappointment.” Or, “Excuse me, I have some ideas for how you might make this better mousetrap–which is a good start–into an even greater mousetrap, despite the fact that I have never myself built any mousetrap.”
And so it goes with the Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Pack. You can put it in the microwave if you need heat, or you can put in the freezer if you want it to be cold. The ceramic beads heat and cool with the gel, providing a nice texture, which one Amazon reviewer says, “makes for an easy massage.” But the title of that review–“slightly different than the norm”–is telling. It implies that the incorporation of a heretofore never used component is something slight. Innovation, people seem to believe, requires a total redo.
Yes, some reviews expressed issues with durability. That’s understandable to call out. A few wished it would be more pliable when frozen. Again, fair.
But then there are the other “complaints.”
One says: “The only drawback I’ve seen so far to this item is its size. For the most part, I don’t think the size will be an issue because it’s probably rare to treat an area larger than 6x10”.""
Just so we’re clear: the only issue this reviewer could foresee would arise in a scenario that they couldn’t foresee arising.
Another–in a review titled “Does the job but not much better than competition”–claims: “the problem is just like every other reusable gel back I’ve ever used: they simply don’t remain truly hot or cold enough for long enough to do a good job. They’re more warm or cool than they are hot or cold for much longer.”
To put it differently: the biggest problem with this product, in this reviewer’s experience, is endemic to this entire product category, not just this product, and relies upon a universal tolerance of hot and cold temperatures.
The point of all this is to show that people will always find things to gripe about. And maybe they’re right. Still, it seems like the best case scenario is that you really love the texture of the ceramic beads inside the gel, and the worst case scenario is that you get three of totally passable hot/cold packs for $18.

Here we go again! The return of The Skeptics Choice, our occasional write-up segment wherein we read what a product claims to do and say, “hmm… I don’t know…” Today, we’re talking about a PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser. Follow along, won’t you?
The Claim
For all those who are thinking that we’ve been through this all before, fear not: this is a different kind of diffuser than the one we sold last time. This one is a “one-of-a-kind product combines the therapeutic properties of a pure Himalayan salt rock lamp with the soothing aromatherapy of an essential oil diffuser.” Apparently, it sets “the perfect mood for relaxation at home” and provides “all the benefits you would expect from this powerful combo.”
The Skepticism
That last part is a little presumptuous. All the benefits I would expect? I understand each word in the phrase “Himalayan Salt Lamp” on its own, but I know nothing about what they mean when they’re put together. But that’s no bother! It’s all laid out right there in the marketing copy:


The first benefit is that it will “help boost your mood.” And honestly, that sounds legit! When you’ve had your windows shut for almost 12 consecutive months because it took just a single day for the seasons transition from the bitter cold of winter to the brutal humidity of summer, something that makes the air smell pretty can be a nice little pick-me-up.


The second benefit is that it can “increase energy levels.” This seems a little more like bullshit than the first claim, but it’s vague enough that I’m willing to give it a pass.


The third benefit is that it will “neutralize the positively charged ions that emit from electronic devices like smartphones, televisions, radios, and more.”


Umm, what the fuck? That sure escalated quickly.
Seriously, the difference in hysteria levels from “it might boost your mood” to “it’ll protect you from killer ions” is about equal to the difference between a “hang in there, kitty” poster and one of those spam posts from MySpace that was like, “Post this on 10 of your friends’ profiles or else your eyes will fall out.”
And by the way, I’m not against a lot of this stuff. Crystals are fine. Astrology is fine. You could argue that it’s unscientific, but that’s missing the point. Life sucks sometimes. If getting some stones to put in your pocket makes you feel less like you’re flying a cloud of chaos towards an inevitably disappointing conclusion, more power to you! I watch groups of men in polyester play what is basically an IRL-board game involving sticks and balls on an enormous grass-and-dirt field, and if the group of men I like outplays the group of men I don’t like, I feel profound happiness. So, I try not to judge people for the things they use to pass the time.
But I will ABSOLUTELY judge anyone who preys upon someone based on those things. Because that’s what they’re doing here. They’re not saying: “you like this thing? we make this thing~” They’re saying, “we make this thing! it is DANGEROUS not to have this thing!!!” In other words, it’s taking something that should be a distraction from the chaos of daily life–which it totally could be, by the way: it’s cool looking; it lights up; it smells nice–and turning it into part of the chaos of daily life. And that’s messed up.
(Also, sorta tangential but still relevant, it’s problematic in a whole other way: What’s dangerous about technology is not that it’s pumping the air full of ions; it’s how intrusive it is. For example, did you know that if you say “Bloody Mary” three times into your smart phone, an ad for “great local brunch spots” will appear on your Facebook timeline? Our devices are definitely listening to us. We can all agree on that, right? Fine, maybe I’m just being paranoid. But you have to know that every Google search, every purchase, every photo you post is being mined for important data. And so making it a conversation about “ions” is pushing it in a direction that helps no one but those selling PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffusers.)
The Conclusion

If you’re thinking about buying this because you’re afraid to breath in all the electro-turds you released into the air while binging Sharp Objects, maybe open a window?"	0.05			2018-08-30T04:00:02.770Z	0.20794343938448737	0.93	60935

I’m a lawyer, but right now, I’m not in the courtroom. Instead, it’s late at night and I’m in my office, wearing Ray-Ban glasses, poring over all the evidence of this grueling case, trying to find something to prove my client is innocent. All the older lawyers at this firm didn’t want to take my client on, and I’m starting to see why, but then again, I’m a young perky go-getter. Sometimes I worry that I’m too concerned with upholding justice, that I get too wrapped up in what’s right and wrong, that I fall in love with too many of my clients. But I can’t think about that now. I need to squint through my Ray-Bans at this piece of paper, then dig out another piece of paper and squint at that one, before realizing I’ve found it: a small but pretty obvious detail that proves my client wasn’t there that night. Thanks, Ray-Bans! I couldn’t have done it without you.

I’m a bit of a nerd. You can tell because I’m always wearing these thick Ray-Ban frames. Also, I’m always doing nerdy things like taking notes in class or carrying a lot of books. Sometimes I drop them, to the delight of cheerleaders and jocks. My best friend is quirky and outgoing, but I am not. I have a figure that would require a nutritionist and hours of gym time each day to maintain, but you can’t see it under these bulky sweaters that I wear, while sitting in my bedroom listening to non-aggressive indie rock or reading an obscure book like Wuthering Heights or The Collected Plays of William Shakespeare. Perhaps someday, someone will move here from out of town and crack this high school’s social hierarchy wide open, but until then it’s just me, my one quirky friend, my books, my sweaters, and my Ray-Ban glasses.

3.

I’m what you might call a savant. I’m always doing things like solving unsolvable math equations, or going to the park and playing five games of chess at a time… and winning. The crisp lines of my Ray-Ban frames are definitely in stark contrast with my wildly disheveled hair! Can I tell you something? I wasn’t surprised to see the government suits show up at my house. What did surprise me was when they took me to the research facility and showed me what they found. I stared at it for a whole a minute. Then I dramatically took off my Ray-Ban glasses, wiped them on my shirt, and stared at it for a minute longer. I didn’t know what I was looking at. What I did know was that, despite being just a guy from Queens (with the IQ of a Nobel laureate), I might save the world. Strap in, Ray-Bans! This is going to be a long ride!

Dearest Meh Customers,
Apparently, our minds cannot be trusted, and for that we are sorry.
You see, in our previous attempt to sell these M Cushions, we misinterpreted a few things. By which we mean, we mistook several vague comments about the massager being applied to unnamed areas beyond the back to mean…
Hmmm…
How do we say it exactly?
Let’s try this: we thought you were implying that the M Cushion could be applied to places where the combination of friction and heat might bring about sensations not unrelated to relief, but a step beyond relief, a sort of deep relief that goes by many names, one of which it shares with a term from film and literature meaning the culmination of the story’s drama.
But, um… apparently we were a little off-base. As one quoted commenter noted:

I swear I didn’t mean it in a sexual way. I just meant after leg day you can lean back in bed and use it on your aching thighs rather comfortably.

So, we apologize to you, commenters who we misunderstood. And moreover, we apologize also to all out there who purchased the M Cushion hoping for that aforementioned special sense of relief and, instead, received what seems to be a pretty good, if not aggressive, massage pillow and little else.
Thus, we promise not to make the same mistake again. We will heretofore not only market the M Cushion 18"" Heated Shiatsu Massage Pillow in a straightforward manner; we also vow never to purposefully misinterpret anything said on our forums as sexual innuendo… unless it’s, like, really funny to do so.

Time to dive into our library of branded content romance novels, for a tale of secrecy, royalty, and grilling. Please enjoy these excerpts from Coals Aflame by Criminy Highlater.

Grilling with one tool? Mary had gotten used to that thanks to her Starfrit Tonglite. In many ways, she was a lot like the 6-in-1 bbq multi-tool: she was strong, she had many skills, could do many things, and, since Eric had run off with his secretary a year before, she relied only on herself.
Which was what she planned to do that Saturday afternoon. Her work at the non-profit, helping troubled youth gain acceptance to Ivy League schools, didn’t leave her much time for making friends, so she would do it on her own. She would take a cooler, her little grill, and her Starfrit, and she would go from her apartment in Soho to Central Park to have a little cookout for one. It would be simple… or so she thought.
“M’lady, if I may have a word,” came a voice soon after she’d set up. Mary ignored it, thinking it sounded so British and refined that it must be coming from someone’s radio. But when it persisted, she looked up.
An austere and very handsome man stood in front of her.
“There you are,” he said. “I couldn’t help but gain sight of your grill, and I wondered if I might bequeath you of a favor?”
Mary had gotten good at doing things alone since Eric left, but there was something interesting about this man, something that made her desire his company.

The man said his name was Collin, and he worked for the a mysterious member of the royal family, Prince Nigel. Mary remembered seeing on the news that Nigel was making his first visit to the United States. She hadn’t listened to the story, because she’d been distracted by the strange mask the prince seemed to wear everywhere.
“What kind of work do you do for him?” Mary asked.
“All sorts,” was all Collin said.
“And so what can I help you with?” Mary asked.
“Well, being among the prince’s central envoy, I am privy to many of the finest restaurants in the world, but I don’t always want to partake in such luxury. And I was hoping you might allow me to dine with you, to take in a true American meal!”
“That’s it?” Mary asked. “You want a burger and some hot dogs?”
“'Tis my heart’s desire,” Collin said with a winning smile. “And if it would please you, I’d be happy to help. For example, perhaps I will unpack the remainder of the tools you require for grilling?”
Mary smiled and held up the Starfrit. “I only need one!”

Mary flipped burgers with the spatula when the upper arm was drawn back and rotated hot dogs with the tongs when the upper arm was extended. She opened them each a bottle of beer with the opener. “A fine colonial ale!” Collin said. Mary laughed, using the Starfrit’s serrated edge to cut the buns.
While they ate, Mary asked, “So is Prince Nigel really as eccentric as he seems?”
“You’re asking about the mask, I presume?”
Mary blushed. ""Well, I–
Collin laughed. “It’s no issue. It’s what everyone wants to know: why is he always wearing that strange masquerade mask, the one behind which he has hidden since his youth? Is his face disfigured? Is he some sort of lunatic? But the truth is, he simply desires privacy. He doesn’t want to be followed everywhere he goes.”
Mary opened her mouth, ready to say that this made sense–that she could not imagine what it must be like–when suddenly the sky went dark.
Nearby people screamed. Collin grabbed her hand, fearfully. “My god, it’s some sort of unpredicted total solar eclipse! Not even my royal astronomer saw this coming!”
Mary switched on the Starfrit’s flashlight, which she usually only used for convenient nighttime cooking.
“What do you mean ‘your’ royal astronomer?” She asked. She pointed the flashlight towards him, then towards his arm, and down to wear his hand still held hers. She felt a rush of something she had not felt in some time, not since Eric.
But then, the sun came back. Mary turned the light off and set the Starfrit down. Collin quickly stood. “I’ve just realized something, something very important,” he said. “Blast, I have so much bloody work. I must be retreating, but perhaps we could meet later? For another ale?”
Mary nodded. Collin named a bar–a dingy sports bar on the East Side–and a time. With that, he was gone. When Mary went to pack up, she couldn’t find her Starfrit anywhere. Which was a shame, as its scraper feature certainly would’ve helped her to clean her grill.

Mary waited at the bar, nursing her beer. The televisions were all turned to the baseball game, with the sound way up. Occasionally, a promo for the evening news promised coverage of Prince Nigel’s visit as well as the strange lunar happening of the afternoon.
“Who cares,” Mary mumbled to herself. Collin was late. Of course he was! He probably wasn’t coming. Another near-miss with love, she thought.
Just then, the feed cut out from the baseball game. “We interrupt this broadcast to bring you, a statement from Prince Nigel the Third.”
There he stood, the man in the strange mask. Mary laughed. He looked so silly. Then he spoke.
“Good morrow, our friends from across the pond,” he said.
Mary felt herself go rigid. She recognized that voice! But no, it couldn’t be. Could it?
“Collin?” she said, as if he could answer her through the television.
“It has been lovely visiting your many museums and areas of historical importance,” the prince went on. “But it was none of them that taught me the most. It was a single person–a single woman–who showed me the true American character, one that is not afraid of multiplicity.” He held up the Starfrit; Mary’s breath caught. “I’ve learned that, like this tool, Americans can do great things, many different great things, and are not as easily categorizable as they seem. And like this tool, they can do wonders at a grill.”
The crowd broke out in laughter in applause. Cameras flashed.
“Now, I may have more to say on this later. But right now, I must be going. I need to return this to its rightful owner. I fear I may even be late!” Just as quickly as the address had begun, it was over. The baseball game returned.
“Anyone sitting here?” a woman said to Mary, indicating the seat next to her at a bar.
Mary smiled. “Yes,” she said. “Or I should say, he’s on his way here now.”"	0.07			2018-08-25T04:00:01.567Z	0.3806925754768836	0.9	53347	0.020357891736731745

When you see an 8-piece cookware set like this–which is really a 4-piece cookware set with a lid for each item–there’s likely an image that comes to mind.
You see yourself standing at the stove, each of the four burners occupied by one of the pots or pans. Perhaps a sauce simmers in one and water comes to a boil in another for pasta that you rolled yourself. You’re sautéing some garlic and onions in yet another, and not with a spatula; instead, with just a flick of your wrist you are cycling it through the air like they do in cooking shows. In the final pan, you brown your steaks before moving them to the oven, where they will cook to a perfect medium rare.
But this image is a fantasy. You can’t actually manage cooking four precise things at once. Honestly, if your stove had only one or two burners, it would work just fine. It might free up some counter space for dealing with the onions you forgot to mince until after your butter had already melted (and burned) in the frying pan.
Thus, purchasing four pots and pans all at once is not necessary, but it is aspirational. You need to keep the dream alive, of wowing your friends and family members with perfectly balanced 4-part meals that make use of descriptors like “deconstructed” or “molecular” or “done three ways.” To have only one pan or one pot would be to admit defeat, to shut the door on your glorious dreams.
In the meantime, great news: you can make your signature “pasta a la butter and a handful of shredded cheese” in one of these just fine!

Dearest Anthony,
It is with a heavy heart that I compose this letter. When you return from your stint with the touring company, you will find me gone, and while we will always be brothers, I will no longer be welcome in our family’s house.
As you might suspect, father discovered my designs. He left for the park to perform his troupe. It was a production of Twelfth Knight, and while he had mentioned that it had been adapted for sock puppets, he made no indication that such modifications involved a shortening of runtime. Thus, I thought I would have nearly three hours of uninterrupted work time. When he arrived home just forty-five minutes later, he found me hard at work on my makeshift drawing table.
Now, I know what you are thinking: why did I not simply lie? You instructed me to do just that when I first confided in you about the designs. But Anthony, I have been lying all my life. I attended L’Academie Royale De L’Art Textile to study sock puppeteering at the age of fifteen. The instructors told me I could emote more with my wrists and palms than most classically trained thespians could with the whole of their bodies. I graduated at the top of my class and received invitations from several of the most renowned touring companies. I traveled the globe. By the age of seventeen, I had performed for two kings and six queens. But it was never what I wanted. I didn’t want to be a sock puppeteer like father and like all of our uncles, like grandfather before them, like you.
And I told father so. When he found me at my drawing table and asked what it was I was scribbling, I confessed everything: that the pretense under which I had returned home–to found my own sock puppet theater–was untrue; that I wanted no longer to act with socks but make my own socks, socks that, in their design alone, possessed as much vibrant life as could be instilled by a skilled sock puppeteer.
Father did not appreciate this, of course. He scoffed at my plans. He told me that out there, beyond the cardboard walls of a sock puppet theater, socks were not lauded but ridiculed. He said there was no such thing as a vibrant life-affirming sock out there. He said they were simple and drab, a mere treaty between foot and shoe.
Moreover, he said I have two options: I must either cast my designs into the fireplace and resume my pursuit of sock puppetry, or forever be banished from his house. As the opening this letter has surely confirmed, I have chosen the latter. I will be traveling far away from here, all the way to the Americas.
So, fare thee well, brother. While it is unlikely that our paths will cross again, perhaps someday you will be in clothing store and you will see a brand of exciting colorful socks with my name upon them and know I have lived my dream.
Yours,
Ezekiel"	0.05			2018-08-22T04:00:07.337Z	0.3287164649283502	0.94	61717			0.03937749319454194	0.07019466178157474

What we’ve got here are some little mystery grab-bags containing cute-ified versions of your favorite (or least favorite) WWE wrestlers. As with each of these Order/Hoarder sales, we like to provide a little math breakdown: for $5, you can get 8 packs of them, which comes out to 63 cents each. On the other hand, you could get 64 packs for just $20. That’s 31 cents each, right? WRONG! Since you can only order 8 or 64, the first 8 cost $5, and the last 56 cost $15, which means those last 56 are costing you just about 27 cents each! That’s one quarter and two pennies! And when you consider that each pack contains 2… that’s less than 14 cents per wrestler!
And if you’re like, “why would I need 128 of these things?” here are a few helpful suggestions:


Put a bowl of them at the end of your desk at work, and if anyone asks you why, just say, in as condescending a voice as possible: “It’s healthier to hold a tiny wrestler than it is to eat candy.”


Give them away at your kids’ parties. Do you kids and their like wrestlers? Great! They’ll love these things. Do they not like wrestlers? That’s okay too. They won’t know who any of these people are and you can just call them L’il Fun Buddies or something.


Isn’t it about time your little Christmas village got some extreme new residents?


Glue them to your dashboard and let them intimidate you into being a better driver.


Carry them around with you and conduct a social experiment called: how many random people on the street will catch a little wrestler when you say to them: hey you, catch this little wrestler?


You do realize it’s only 71 days till Halloween, right?

At $49, this has got to be the most expensive backpack we’ve ever sold. And for that reason it’s not going to be for everyone.
And we don’t just mean if you’re not into GoPro stuff. Because, yes: it has a Go-Pro mount, as well as a padded crushproof compartment to hold 3 GoPros and a bunch of GoPro related gear. But even if you’re not into capturing your various thrill-seeking adventures on video, there’s still plenty of use here. It’s sturdy, lightweight, and features a variety of useful compartments, such as built-in fanny-pack pockets on the waist-belt in which you can stash your phone or anything else you need close at hand.
But yeah: if you just need a backpack that does only what its name implies–a pack to put on your back–then you probably don’t want to spend $49. Not even for one that has mostly 5-star reviews (and nothing lower than a 4) on Amazon…
On Amazon. On… Amazon…
Why does that seem relevant?
Oh, we know: it’s because, while we’re selling it for $49, it actually retails for just north of $100 over there. And so all these people who are saying “Awesome bag” or “I LOVE THIS PACK” or “Bag is amazing” or simply “Perfect”–they’re happy to have spent three-figures on these thing!
They could’ve put that money towards two week’s worth of groceries or a few gas tank’s worth of gas or a few months of internet or a vending machine snack every Monday through Friday for a third of the year, but instead they spent it on a bag. And not only did they not regret it; they LOVED it.
Our point is: it must be a pretty good bag. Our other point is: at least we’re selling it for half as cheap as elsewhere."	0.05			2018-08-20T04:00:03.040Z	0.345231304974333	0.92	70757

Let’s just get right to the basic question here: what is so damn smart about these Smart Stands?
“Smart” has come to be synonymous with “online” or “connected to wifi.” But these Smart Stands are neither. They are an amalgamation of plastic and hinge. There is no voice control or app so you can manage it while you’re on vacation or built-in analytics to tell you how you might best use it in the future, based on your past trends. They just sit there and holds up your tablet or phone.
And maybe in that way they’re the smartest of “smart” products: because they’re smart enough to know what they do well, and also to know what they don’t need to do.
The past is a veritable web of failed innovations. Just like no one wanted pasta from Panera or personal pizzas from Subway, nobody’s pining for some bullshit half-functional beta-level technology to do something that was already extremely simple. Being “smart” is not just creating new complicated functions to prove you can; it’s pausing before you do all the work and asking, “Wait, why are we doing this? Is this actually necessary?”
But you know who didn’t skip that step? Smart Stands. They asked, “Why?” And they said, “Because sometimes you want your tablet to be up like this rather than down like that.” And then they asked, “Should we go further?” And they decided: “No, because the further we go, the more we risk losing our greatest asset, which is that our stands are universally compatible with all phones and tablets.”
See, sometimes intelligence is knowing when to stop and say, “Good enough for me.” Which is why these smart stands are good enough for you, no matter what kind of device you prefer."	0.07			2018-08-19T04:00:02.021Z	0.46941764127665553	0.94	53660			0.024072699552649

Yes, we mentioned the blender bottles sale from a couple Saturdays ago in yesterday’s write-up, but we were mostly talking about the bottles themselves. Today, we’d like to talk about the sale.
See, that sale was an experiment. We offered two choices: a rational number of bottles (the 4-pack) for a good price; or an irrational number of bottles (the 16-pack) for an even better price, with no middle ground. We wanted to know, could we bait you into making a totally ridiculous purchase just by making you feel like you’d gotten a ‘great deal’?
The answer, in a fair number of cases, was ‘yes!’ And so here we are again.
Now, before we get to the product, we need to name this as-of-today recurring sale type. Some ideas:
The Excess Express: Because like an express train, there are few stops between where you should go and the end of the line!
DTB: Does it stand for “Down to buy”? Nope! It’s “Direct to Basement.” Because you don’t need to pretend you’re actually going to use all this stuff! Take one out, deposit the rest downstairs with all the other stuff you thought was a good investment!
Any or Many: Pretty self-explanatory. Other option, along these lines: “More or Less.” Other other option, along these lines: “Deal or Mo’ Deal.”
Irrational Numbers: Are these deals really that much like the mathematical concept of irrational numbers? Yes–because the logic of either is hard to explain–but also no–because only one of them will make you feel smart.
(Also, hello nerds, who are right now gearing up to compose some long screed in the comments about how, well, actually, it’s not that difficult at all to explain irrational numbers!)
Anyway, you can vote on those on today’s poll (and give your own suggestions). Who knows! Maybe if this works, we’ll have a whole spin-off site where do only this kind of deal! Eh?!
As for today’s product, here’s some info: they’re power banks, so it’s not exactly as impractical to have a bunch of them as it was with the blender bottles. Also, we sold something that looks like these before, with the shoe sole pattern, but these are the 6000mAh version, whereas last time they were 9000mAh. On the plus side: that means they’re smaller. On the downside: that means they have less charging capacity (each one can carry enough power to charge the average phone about 3 full times, rather than 4 with the other version).
But really, what’s important is THE DEAL! Because think about: at 2 for $12, that’s $6 per power bank. Not a bad price at all. BUT if you opt for 10, and assume that the first 2 cost $6 each, that means the last 8 cost just $24, or a mere $3 each! And if you go deeper and consider that each of those 8 is rated at 6,000 milliamp hours, that means that you’re only paying $0.0005 per mAh! And $0.0005 is basically nothing, and a lot of nothing is still nothing, therefore, WE’RE PRETTY MUCH GIVING THESE THINGS AWAY!
Okay, maybe we kind of flubbed up the logic there. But the question remains: do you want a boring old 2-pack of Xsories 6000mAh Power Banks for $12 or an amazing 10 for $36?!"	0.07			2018-08-18T04:00:05.333Z	0.3572084668612603	0.93	53049			0.024494294870486415

You probably saw the word “blender” and the word “bottle” and thought, why do I need this thing when I just received my 4 or 16 pack of blender bottles? But the products are actually very different. For example, the blender bottles we sold before were both blenders and bottles, whereas this is a blender that comes with two vessels for blending that are themselves bottles.
Or, to put it differently:
The blender bottles are bottles that can blend things inside the bottle, whereas this is a blender that blend things inside one of the two bottles that come with it (or more than two, if you order more than one blender, in which case, you simply need to multiply the number of blenders you order by two to ascertain the number of bottles, which again, are not blender bottles, but bottles that work with this blender).
But here’s the thing: even if you ordered the blender bottles, you can still order this blender and bottles, because the blender and the blender bottles (not to be confused with the bottles that come with the blender) can be used together (although, obviously, the blender and the bottles it comes with can be used together too). See, blender bottles we sold a couple weeks ago, having only a small metal ball rather than a blade or a motor (like this blender has), aren’t really great at being blenders, but they are good at whisking things (so maybe they should be called ‘whisker bottles,’ although on second thought, maybe not, as that sounds like something altogether different and unappealing).
Point is, you could use the blender–this one, the one with a motor and a blade–for more intense blending jobs, like making a fruit smoothie. Then, you can pour the smoothie from the blender’s blending bottle into a blender bottle and take it with you wherever you’re going, so that you can whisk it back together if it settles.
What we’re saying is that what you should really do is buy this blender and two bottles and then pour the things you make in the blender’s bottles into one of your blender bottles, while using the bottles that come with the blender just for the initial blending.
Unless you didn’t buy the blender bottles. In which case, disregard the above."	0.05			2018-08-17T04:00:10.364Z	0.30912710887561573	0.94	60832

Well, this is a first from our branded content romance novel collection: a teenaged paranormal love story! Please enjoy these excerpts of The Heart Races Until It Rests by Annborny Hilledale.

Ellie met Henri while running.
She was not looking for love. When she’d quit the cheerleading squad to join cross-country, her boyfriend Brad, the quarterback of the school’s football team, dumped her because her running gear didn’t look “as hot.” She was relieved more than anything. She was a senior and she had decisions to make: did she want to go to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Oxford, or one of the other ivy league schools she’d gotten into?
Really, Ellie wanted to got to a small liberal arts school and study poetry, but it wasn’t up to her. Both her mother and her father were founders and CEOs of very powerful companies, and they’d both fought so much about whose company Ellie would eventually take over that they’d gotten a divorce. The only thing they could agree on anymore: Ellie had to study business.
Her Polar Heart Rate Monitor beeped helpfully to let her know her heart rate had risen above her optimal zone. Ellie often ran too fast when she got anxious about the future.
She slowed down, which was when the boy appeared at her side. ‘Appeared’ because Ellie hadn’t seen him approach. “Good day!” he said with a smile. He looked about her age but also–Ellie couldn’t exactly describe it–almost sepia-toned? He wore a strange antiquated cotton shirt and cotton shorts and his shoes appeared old-fashioned, with almost no support. “The name is Henri. I’ve just begun to undertake the task of what I’ve heard referred to as ‘cardiovascular activity’ and I was wondering if you might allow me to accompany you!”
Ellie looked at her Polar Heart Rate Monitor again. Its easy-to-read screen let her know that she’d reached her workout goal for the day. “Sorry. I’m actually just wrapping up.”
Henri looked at his shoes, disappointed. “I understand,” he said.
“But tomorrow,” Ellie heard herself say. She didn’t know why. There was something interesting about him. “I’ll pick you up at your house and we’ll go for a jog. Where do you live?”
“Just past 229 Healy Street.” Something seemed to occur to Henri. “But upon a secondary thought, t’wouldst it be possible to meet right here?”
Ellie agreed. The plan was set.

For all his grandstanding about not understanding ‘cardiovascular activity’ Henri never seemed to get tired. They talked the whole way about classic poetry. Henri was very familiar and spoke about the poets in a funny way. Like with his look, Ellie couldn’t exactly place the strangeness of his tone except to say it seemed that he often spoke as if he knew the poets personally. She chalked it up to an affect, of which Henri had plenty!
“What is that strange jewelry you wear?” he asked at one point.
“This? It’s my Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Its convenient display makes it easy to track my total calories burned per session as well as provide a weekly training summary.”
“Is it expressly designed for this very activity?”
“Nope! It’s great for biking, circuit training, or even just walking. Here do you want to try it on?”
“Oh, that’s not necessary–” Henri started to say, but Ellie had already stopped and slipped it off her wrist. Had this all been a ploy to take his exceedingly pale wrist into her hand? Did she have a growing desire to touch him? Perhaps, but Henri seemed uncomfortable, and they ran the rest of the way in silence.
Later, when she uploaded the data easily to her free profile at polarpersonaltrainer.com by way of her Polar Flowlink, she noticed something odd. The data for her run was there, but around the time she put the watch on Henri, all heart rate readings went blank.
“Huh,” she said. “Must be an issue with the monitor.” But her Polar Heart Rate Monitor had always worked flawlessly before…

It kept happening. Each day, the Polar would continuously display her own heart rate, and when Henri would wear it for the second half of their run–something Ellie insisted on, as a means of testing its functionality–there would be no reading.
But she didn’t know how to tell him something was wrong. Just as they managed to remain in the optimal zone for burning fat thanks to the Heart Rate Monitor, so too did it feel as if they were always in the optimal zone for conversation. She could tell Henri anything and he seemed to understand: about her parents, about her college decision, or about her day at school (from which he was conspicuously absent).
Finally, one day she couldn’t help it.
“Henri,” she said. “I need to tell you something. I’m in love with you.”
“And I need to tell you something,” Henri said. “Ellie, I’m a ghost. The ghost of Henri Olson, a long forgotten poet who died in his teens.”
Ellie should’ve been surprised, but somehow she wasn’t. “So that’s why your heart rate never showed up.”
“Alas!” he cried. “But if it could, it would read a number so high, as just the sight of you sets me aflutter! You see, I have unfinished business, Ellie. I have never felt love.”
“Never?”
“You must understand: it was a different time when I was born. We weren’t worried about heart rates. If we could have such a glorious device as that Polar when I was growing up, it would not measure calories but risk of scarlet fever. In such a dangerous time, can one ever feel true love? I say no, despite writing so many poems about it. But with you Ellie, well I’ve been trying to deny it. To admit so much would be to finish my unfinished business…”
“Just kiss me,” Ellie said. She leaned forward with her eyes closed and their lips met. She tasted no salty sweat on his lips, despite that the Polar Heart Rate Monitor said they’d really been pushing themselves. But of course she wouldn’t. Ghosts didn’t sweat, not even beautiful ones.
In the moment before she could open her eyes, Henri whispered: “Ellie, I love you.”
Ellie found herself alone on the road.

The dean of the English department at the small idyllic Halpern College ushered Ellie into his office. She didn’t wear her Polar Heart Rate Monitor because she was afraid her rapid nervous heartbeat would set off an alarm.
“It’s quite unusual,” the dean said, “for a freshman to win our annual award for gothic poetry, but the imagery you’ve presented–of the final kiss, of riding your bike past his supposed address and finding a graveyard, all of it–it’s just so lovely. Such a wonderful imagination.”
“You could call it that,” Ellie said.
“So I’m pleased to say, as your reward, we will purchase any book for the library in your name. Now, don’t be afraid to take some time to think it over–”
“The Collected Works of Henri Olson.”
The dean cocked his head to the side. “I don’t think I’ve heard of him?”
“He died very young,” Ellie said, pretending to rub her eye to wipe away a tear. “But he–I mean, his poems–they were really quite lovely.”"	0.05			2018-08-16T04:00:03.517Z	0.23418002803322968	0.94	61944

Friends, before reading further, lock your doors, turn on all of the lights, and gather your pets and loved ones tight, because the following is a horror story.
We begin with a young man. Let us give him a name. Let us call him Sean.
This all happened some years ago, when Sean was just a naive young man who believed, due to being brought up in the Northeast within proximity to a certain corporate food chain, that donut shops could be relied upon for iced coffee. It was this misunderstanding that will ultimately lead to our story’s tragic end. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Sean, walking the streets of Seattle on a hot summer afternoon, entered a donut shop–not one of the fancy ones you may have heard of; a small, out-of-the-way place that will remain nameless–and asked the man behind the counter, “Do you have iced coffee?”
The man replied, “Yes, we have iced coffee.” Or no, that’s not it. That’s not it at all. What he said was: “Yes, I can do iced coffee.”
This should’ve been the tell, the sign that something was amiss and Sean should flee that donut shop. But he ignored the portents. He removed a small bill and said, “Great, I’ll have an iced coffee then.”
What happened next is almost too gruesome to put into words.
Almost.
The man behind the counter took a large styrofoam cup, filled it with ice, and proceeded to pour hot coffee from the pot directly over it, handing Sean, to his horror, a lukewarm watery mess.
But do not grieve for Sean. Do not shed one single tear over his ruined attempt to seek cold caffeination. For Sean is a complex protagonist, and he is not without blame here.
Because why was he even seeking to purchase an iced coffee in the first place? Why was he not buying beans in bulk and then using this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Bundle to make his own deliciously smooth and delightfully cheap iced coffee at home? Perhaps, if he had, the day before, loaded up the 1.6 qt. cold brew carafe–or the bottle, which he could’ve carried with him–he might have avoided such a cruel fate.
As is the case with many stories of terror and woe, this is a cautionary tale. Do not, dear reader, make the same mistake Sean made. Buy this bundle and live forever in cold coffee bliss."	0.05			2018-08-15T04:00:09.341Z	0.31881841989687204	0.93	65238

Children.

They were given a tube made of glass–the most satisfying of all smashables–filled with a weird, perhaps even delicious-looking, red substance.
Kids these days have it easy.
Or do they?
My mom, a nurse, always had a cupboard in the bathroom stocked with the most up-to-date medical paraphernalia. Therefore, we had a digital thermometer from the beginning. It was nice. Like this one, no mercury. Like this one, an easy straightforward digital readout of your temperature. Unlike this one, it took what felt like a half-hour to give a final verdict on whether or not you’d reached that magical realm north of 98.6 and earned the day off from school. And so, it wasn’t uncommon for the temperature-taker to put the thermometer in the child’s mouth and then walk away to take care of something else, allowing the child freedom to manipulate, through a variety of means, the final result.
This is hypothetical, of course. I would never have done such a thing.
(Oh, and also, just an FYI: that whole 98.6 being the average human temperature thing is the result of tests conducted by one doctor using a crummy armpit thermometer in the 19th century and is mostly bullshit.)

On day one, we sold a Roomba. That was in July, 2014. In the last 5 months of that year–our first 5 months of operation–we sold 5 more Roombas. We sold one or two in 2015. Since then, nothing. No more Roombas…
UNTIL TODAY!
What’s the best metaphor to capture the excitement of our reunification? Perhaps we could think of ourselves as a once famous rock band who amicably splintered to pursue our solo careers. We would certainly be the experimental-minded keyboardist, doing avant-guard work with help of speaker docks and vacuum sealers, whereas the Roomba would be the pop-forward frontman, producing hit after hit, each one more-or-less the same.
And now comes our glorious reunion tour!
(Although, now that I think about it, don’t bands usually reunite when the “well has run dry,” so to speak? As in: a last ditch effort to regain their former wealth or reputation?)
How about a different metaphor: in the 2015 we let the Roomba go off to clean, and now, after many years of service to the greater world, it’s made its circuitous way back to Meh, its noble charging port!
Nice pivot, eh?
Anyway, as we implied above, in the time since we last sold a Roomba, there have been, by our estimation, 6,000 new models released, all of which look almost exactly the same. So, if you’re wondering why you should buy this Roomba instead of a different Roomba, we are too.
But here’s what we gathered from these helpful breakdowns over at Vacuum Fanatics: the 805 is basically the base model of iRobot’s higher-end (though not highest end) 800 series of vacuum cleaners. It doesn’t have wi-fi like the 890, so it doesn’t work with Alexa or Google Assistant. Nor does it have the improved sensor capabilities of the 860. But it does have a lot of the other things that make those models great, such as a big bin and an AeroForce High Efficiency Filter, meaning the air that passes through it comes out a lot cleaner (which could be a big deal for allergy sufferers).

When the employees arrived at their first day at the new NOTILUS headquarters, they noticed something strange.
“There is no roof,” one of them said.
“Exactly,” said one of the higher-ups. “It’s an open-roof open-office.”
“But we won’t be protected from the rain,” said another employee.
“Exactly,” the higher-up said again.
The building had tile floors and was equipped with a siren. It sounded whenever a storm approached, at which point, the employees took the tarps provided to them and covered their computers, their phones, anything that could succumb to water damage. Then, they stood. They closed their eyes. They waited for the rain to wash over them so that they could understand it, become one with it.
Thus, when they engineered their shower heads to have 6 settings including “Wide Rainfall” and “Power Rain,” they knew these to be the true to their names. And when they built dual-zone antimicrobial jets that did not clog, it was not only to provide their customers with consistently strong water pressure; it was to mimic the rain that, year after year, never ceased to lessen in its strength.

The great philosopher Zaza Pachulia once said: “Nothing easy.” He was referring to the 8th seed Atlanta Hawks forcing a game seven against the 1st seed Boston Celtics, but his words are applicable to so many things in life. For us, there is “nothing easy” about balancing our standards for honest copy with our desire to offer a diverse range of products. Some days, it just seems untenable. And friends, today is one of those days. Because if I gave my 100% honest opinion of this ProCabello Straightener and Styler Kit it would be this:
IDK, it looks good to me, I guess.
See, I don’t actually know. I’ve never used a hair straightener, nor can I foresee a scenario arising in the future where I will either. Then again, this isn’t my first rodeo. There’ve been plenty of products I don’t particularly care about, and when they come up, there’s a simple solution: lean on the Amazon reviews.
Unfortunately this doesn’t help me much here, because the reviews, while positive (and that’s despite the significantly higher price point WITHOUT the “Shine and Hold Spray” we’re including), say very little.
For example, here is Diane Camargo’s review in full:

Love it!! The best flat iron I’ve used

And Karen Tucci writes:

Awesome flat iron. Heats up super fast. Has multiple heat settings. Very happy with my purchase.

And Adrian Blake Hammonds writes:

I love the way my hair feels.

Is it good to see such positive reviews of the item we’re selling? Sure. Do these reviews help me, as a copywriter, find an interesting angle for my write-up? No. Did I include three of them when one would suffice simply to push the write-up further down the page, thus making it appear longer? Of course. Unless it’s @Dave asking, in which case, no way! I did it for integrity!
Really the point is, it’s difficult to write about something without any personal attachment to even the concept of it. That’s why so much copy looks like… well… copy. But that’s not what we want. Likewise, we can’t just sell the stuff we know how to write about. We need to sell items that are outside of our comfort zone sometimes. Are they outside of the greater Meh community’s comfort zone, too? Maybe. Only time (and all of the graphs at the bottom of the page) will tell.

We’ve got another weird item pedaling vague impossible-to-prove pseudo-science, so that means another installment of THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE: a feature wherein we lay out the product’s claims and explain why we’re not so sure we believe them. Here goes!
The Claim
The Pure Daily Care Diffuser is the “ultimate starter pack for essential oil enthusiasts.” The various botanical oils are “100% pure” and also “100% organic” with “no fillers or additives.” All of this is fairly simple. Where it gets more interesting is in laying out the benefits of each included oil:

Peppermint is a “mental stimulant” that “provides energy”;
Orange is a “respiratory stimulator, antiseptic, antidepressant, aphrodisiac, and neural stimulator”;
Tea Tree is a “powerful immune stimulator”;
Lemongrass is “neural stimulator” that “soothes aches and pains while also reducing anxiety”;
Lavender is another “neural stimulator” that “reduces stress and anxiety and promotes restful sleep”;
and Eucalyptus is a “respiratory booster” and is “great for relieving sinus congestions.”

The Skepticism
Perhaps I shouldn’t call myself skeptical here. I’m not skeptical. I think this is bullshit, and moreover, I think it’s pretty dangerous. Not the diffuser itself, but the language.
Because eucalyptus oil will not relieve sinus congestion in a meaningful way. And lemongrass oil isn’t going to help with your sore joints. And orange oil is as much an antidepressant as the two day old styrofoam tub that held raw chicken in the trash is a depressant. By which I mean: walking into a house that smells bad sucks, and therefore will make you feel unhappy; so, conversely, walking into a house that smells good doesn’t suck, thus making you happy by contrast.
This is all to say that if you have sinus issues, or joint pain, or depression, don’t just buy a diffuser. See a doctor.
But again, this is an issue of language, specifically language that makes empty promises. The actual truth is essential oil diffusers are great. They don’t smell as fake and chemical-y as plug-ins. They’re not smokey like incense. It’s kinda cool to watch the mist rise out of them. And this one has 7 neat ambient light settings.
That’s why my wife and I are buying one: not for any medical reasons, but because we just moved into a new house and we want it to smell okay. Even when I forget to take out the trash…
In Conclusion
Diffusers are actually pretty nice, as long as what you’re looking for is a good smell, and not a cure."	0.05			2018-08-08T04:00:06.259Z	0.21768616353254416	0.94	62973

It’s been a while since we’ve been able to dip into our library of branded content romance novels, but luckily, we found one that just happens to involve today’s product. Get ready for a tale of desire and medical emergencies in these excerpts from Gene Harmony’s Love Is A Medicine Best Served At The Appropriate Temperature(s).

People were always asking Dale to open jars because of his amazingly strong arms. And people were also always asking why, when he could so easily be a model, he chose to work at the front desk of a pharmaceuticals lab. “Not everyone wants to be on the runway,” he’d say with a smile of clean white teeth that reinforced his model-like qualities. The real answer, though, was that he’d always had the desire to save lives. Working here, where so many important medications were developed, was the closest he could get.
Dale wasn’t the only one in the lab whose good looks were surprising. Rumor had it that Dr. Liza modeled to pay her way through graduate school on the way to becoming the world’s foremost expert on life-saving drugs. Whether that was true or not, Dale had to admit: she was beautiful. Even now, as she rushed up to the desk in her lab coat, clearly flustered, she looked exquisite.
Dale thought maybe she was coming to flirt, something that happened often, though nothing ever came of it. She was a lauded scientist, after all, and he a lowly receptionist. But flirting was not on the agenda today.
“Can I ask a big favor?” she said. “No one else is available to help and there’s a patient in need of an experimental medication. We have to get to the hospital, so it can be safely administered. Could you give me a ride?”
“No problem,” Dale said, standing.
“But there is a problem,” Dr. Liza said. “It’s a complicated medication, comprised of three very volatile liquids that cannot be combined until the last possible minute before being administered. Also, each substance must be kept within a certain temperature range. If I leave them in their test-tubes, they’ll grow too warm or too cold on the ride over.”
“I have just the thing,” Dale said.

Dale and Dr. Liza carried the four Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs out to his car: three filled with temperature controlled substances, one extra, “Just in case,” Dr. Liza had said.
“We need to be careful with these,” she said now, but it was not an issue at all, given that the Primulas’ contemporary attractive twist-textured design allowed for a secure grip. Not to mention they were splash-resistant! “And you’re sure they’re not contaminated?”
“Absolutely,” said Dale. “It’s very easy to clean the mugs themselves. And I put the lids through my dishwasher at home, on the top rack, where it’s safe for them to go.”
Dale could tell that Dr. Liza, though still nervous, was happy to hear this. And she was even happier when she saw that all four mugs fit into the various front- and back-seat cup-holders of Dale’s modest hatchback. “Like a glove,” she murmured to herself. “Maybe I’ll be okay after all.”
“What’s that?” Dale said.
But Dr. Liza didn’t repeat herself.

They’d left the lab an hour ago. The hospital was only five miles away. Yet, they found themselves only halfway there, stuck in unmoving bumper-to-bumper traffic. The reprieve in Dr. Liza’s anxiety, brought on by the various positive aspects of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs, proved temporary. Out of the corner of his eye, Dale had watched her grow more and more upset–first sitting straight up, then tapping her fingers on the dash and sighing loudly.
When she finally spoke, her voice cracked with fear. “It’s no use. We’re getting nowhere. We need to administer the medication now.”
“But how are we going to do that?” Dale said. “The patient is at the hospital.”
“No, I said we need to go to the hospital so they can administer it safely. The patient isn’t there. Not yet. She’s here. Dale, it’s me.”
“What?!”
“Look at me, Dale,” Dr. Liza said. “You’re going to have to administer the drug that’ll save my life from the disease I’ve kept a secret all these months.”
“But, but…”
“There are no buts about it,” Dr. Liza said. She pointed to one of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs. “See that Primula 20oz Insulated Mug? You told me that–with its double walls, vacuum seal, and triple-layer Copper Cold Technology–it can keep liquids hot for up to 8 hours and cool for 24. It makes sense that you’d have such a mug, because you’re a lot like it. You want to save lives. I’ve seen it in your eyes, and like a giant beautiful man-shaped Primula 20oz Insulated Mug, you keep that desire at the appropriate temperature so that it never dies.”
Dale nodded. She was right. He’d waited his whole life for this. Without a word, he got the empty Primula and carefully mixed the contents from the others together in it. “Now, what do I do?”
“It needs to be applied to my lips,” Dr. Liza said. “But first, it requires vermilion stabilization, meaning it must be applied to a healthy pair of lips, and then transferred from those lips to the taker’s.”
Dale understood what he must do. He gravely opened the easy-open, easy-close lid. It was straw-compatible but he didn’t need one now. He let the liquid touch his lips, and then he leaned over the center console to Dr. Liza…

Dale paced. He held a Primula 20oz Insulated Mug. He had cleaned it and filled it with coffee from the hospital waiting room two hours ago when he arrived, and it was still hot.
Finally, the doctor appeared. “She’s recovering,” he said, “thanks to that experimental drug she made and thanks to your administering of it. Still, to be safe, we’ll give her regular doses of it every four hours.”
“And how will you give it to her?” Dale said, feeling strangely jealous. “Do you have a machine for vermilion stabilization?”
The doctor looked at him, confused.
“You know,” Dale said. “It needs to be applied from healthy lips to the lips of the diseased.”
“It’s taken orally, son,” the doctor said. Then a sly grin came across his face. “If I had to wager a guess, I’d say someone has a crush on you!”"	0.05			2018-08-07T04:00:06.333Z	0.5387061168679262	0.92	64187			0.11531935223472428

“Do not cast your pearls before swine.”
People spoke these words without thinking, for a moment, of how they would hurt me, a pig. But more than speak them, they lived by them. Every time I walked into a jewelry store, they quickly rushed to put away their finest pearls.
I told them, “But it is me. I am not a descendent of some clown like Porky. My grandfather built the first ever wolf-proof house. He patented his  special structurally-sound brick-laying technique, and it has been used in the constructions of homes the country over, including three governors’ mansions. He passed his business down to my father who passed it down to me, and now, my net worth is somewhere in the high nine-figures. So please, allow me to purchase the great jewels of the sea.”
Still, I received nothing.
Then, one day, I saw a New Yorker cartoon. One dog sat on the floor, listening to another, seated at a computer.

The jewels look pretty much like a silver band from any further than a foot away, which is maybe a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preference.
They make a big deal about how they are designed for the minuscule ears of women, which I thought was just goofy marketing. But I’ll be honest, none of the 5 tip sizes really worked for my brutish masculine ears.
I was, however, able to get some tips from a previous pair onto them (with a little coaxing).
All-in-all, a very solid buy. If I didn’t already have 2 pairs, I’d buy some more as backup.

You get 2 pairs of Maroo ICE Headphones, but when you receive them, you might think you accidentally ordered 8. Because despite their “smaller fit for women’s ears,” these things come in an unnecessarily big and complicated box. User @Chakolate sums it up pretty nicely:

What is a problem is the amount of packaging. The unopened package is 223 grams, of which 11 grams are the actual headphones. They come in a jewelry-type velvet box, which is nestled in a lot of plastic, which is inside a thin cardboard box, which is wrapped in tissue paper. They also include a carry pouch, and a thick little book about how to use them. (Seriously? They’re kidding, right?) The end package is about 8x3x3"", which is absurd for headphones.

And in case you need some idea of how big that actually is, here’s a picture.

For context, the can next to it is 16 ounces. It’s also a delicious hazy New England style IPA as good as any I had back east from the best brewery in Des Moines! (In case anyone from Confluence is reading and wants to give me some swag.)
Now, you’re probably thinking: “All that stuff for some bedazzled earbuds? What a waste!” But you’re not looking at the big picture. All the various packaging materials are not simply for this product; they’re for a bunch of different things we’ve sold over the course of the last year. For example:


You can cut up the plastic casing and put them in your Ray Ban Eyeglasses when one of the lenses breaks.


You can use the jewelry case to hold your Diamond Encrusted Eternal Heart-Shaped Pearl earrings.


You can use the pouches for safe transport of your WWE TeenyMates.


And you can use the tissue paper when you move to wrap the little espresso cups you got to go along with your Nespresso Vertuo.


Because everyone buys every product we sell, right? That’s how this is supposed to work. We put up an item each day, and you, in turn, buy at least one of that item each day, but preferably two or three.
Wait… really? You only buy some things we sell?! So we can’t rely on every user buying every single product?!?!

Four Blender Bottles probably seems like plenty of Blender Bottles. You have your Blender Bottle, your backup Blender Bottle, a Blender Bottle to try weird stuff in, and a Blender Bottle to give away when your friend is like, “Oh, I should get a Blender Bottle like that.”
Sixteen Blender Bottles is probably too many Blender Bottles. Even if you’re very clumsy with your Blender Bottles, or very experimental, or have a lot of friends who want Blender Bottles, you’re still probably going to end up with a few leftover Blender Bottles.
So why should you get sixteen Blender Bottles?
Because it’s possible that this is the best ever deal on Blender Bottles. You’re probably thinking: sixteen Blender Bottles for $49? That’s about $3 per Blender Bottle. Not bad, right? But it gets even better, because really, if four Blender Bottles costs $20, that means you’re really getting twelve Blender Bottles at $29. So you’re looking at a cost of less than $2.50 per Blender Bottle after the initial four Blender Bottles.
(Which, side note, makes for a great conversation starter. The next time you have some friends over just point to the pile of Blender Bottles in the corner–and there will be a pile of them in the corner; you have sixteen of them, after all–and say, “See that Blender Bottle? That Blender Bottle only cost me $2.42.” Just, make sure you point to one of the last twelve Blender Bottles, not one of the first four Blender Bottles, because as we’ve established, those Blender Bottles cost more.)
With savings like that, can you really pass up buying sixteen Blender Bottles?
You can?

The FoodSaver conference room was tense. Nobody knew why the emergency meeting had been called except that it involved “a failure in marketing.”
Finally, Richard, the sixty year old exec who’d sent out the invite, arrived.
“Folks, we’ve got problems,” he said. “Our prized product, the Vacuum Sealing System, is being used for things other than saving food. Which is bad, because that’s our name. One thing they’re using it for is something called ‘Sous vide,’ which I believe is a religion, so we’ll want to be very careful there. But the other thing is–” Richard looked around, and spoke in a hushed tone–“they’re using it for marijuana.”
“They smoke through the machine?” asked Terry, age fifty-two.
“That’s what I thought at first,” Richard said. “But it turns out it’s more for storage and keeping it fresh. Anyway, there’s a whole bunch of people doing it. I found a message board where everyone was snap-chatting about it. The Red Edit.”
“It’s called Reddit,” said the intern, age twenty-one. “It’s the ‘trees’ subreddit.”
“Nope, that’s not it,” said Richard. “It’s definitely not about trees. Your generation wouldn’t understand because your Woodstocks were different. Anyway, we need to cash in on this, and we need to cash in on this NOW. We need a marketing campaign. Something to appeal to the youth.”
“But you just said my generation–”
“Quiet, intern. The adults are talking. Now, let’s spitball a little. What do we got?”
“What if,” said Tony, age fifty-eight, “we do one of those internet pictures and then make it go viral?”
“I like that,” Richard said. “That’s a good plan: a viral internet picture.”
“I’ve seen one particular internet picture,” said Harry, age fifty-eight, “where there’s a man pointing at a butterfly. The man will be labeled, and the butterfly will be labeled, but the man will be saying, ‘Is this a something-other-than-butterfly?’”
“Because it’s labeled as something else,” Richard said.
“No,” said Harry. “I should’ve mentioned that too. He doesn’t call it what it’s labeled, either. He calls it something else. I believe that’s part of the joke.”
“Okay, so,” said Terry, “we label the butterfly ‘FoodSaver’ and the man as ‘consumer’ and he’s asking: ‘Is this a thing for storing my reefer?’”
“Ganja,” said Tony. “Let’s say ‘ganja.’”
“Good catch,” said Richard. “We need to use relevant terms.”
“Also, underneath the question,” said Harry, “it should say, ‘Yes, and you can has it!’”
“That’s with the cat, right?” Richard said.
“No,” Terry said. “Cat says, ‘hang in there.’”
“Well, this has been very productive,” said Richard. “Good work, team. I’ll send this along to the design department. I’ll tell them to redraw the image in case there’s a copyright issue and to get us twelve potential samples by this afternoon.”
“You want the design department to make twelve images in a few hours?” asked the intern.
“Yes,” said Richard.
“But how?”
“They have computers,” Richard said. “It’s easy. And anyway, I don’t tell them how to do their jobs. Until I do. Now, intern, didn’t I put you on a special office sustainability project? I thought you kids love that stuff.”

But who? Yes, there are plenty of people out there who love jewelry, but these days the gift-giving season (at least in our experience) seems to be less about personal affects and more about technological advancement. You don’t get your mom earrings anymore; you get her a tablet. And you don’t get your grandmother a bracelet; you order her a Roku and help set up Netflix so she can watch her shows on an infinite loop without commercial interruption. So who are you buying this jewelry for?
You might not be able to think of anyone… and that’s exactly the point!
You’re forgetting somebody. Or maybe you’re not. Maybe you didn’t even realize Aunt Gilma was coming this year, after what happened at the Easter Parade. Or maybe you didn’t know Cousin Nick was bringing his girlfriend from college, or that he had a girlfriend at all, or that he was in college, and actually the more you think about it, the less you remember even having a cousin Nick. But that doesn’t matter. She’ll be there for the holidays, and come Christmas morning you don’t want her to have to sit awkwardly on the floor among the landscape of shredded wrapping paper with a big pile of nothing to bring home.
And jewelry is the perfect gift in this situation: a nice, attractive, inoffensive, break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option for that special someone in your life… that you totally spaced on.
In other words, it wouldn’t hurt to just have some around this time of year.

Yes, with each day there comes fewer hours of sunlight to warm things up. The numbers you saw on the right in the “low” column have begun their migration left, replacing the previously pleasant “high” temperatures. Thus, this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Maker and travel brewers might, you think, only be used a short time before they go into storage. Because brewing iced coffee in December is like the beverage equivalent of wearing shorts during a blizzard: something done, in states that experience a true winter, only by the extremest of die-hards and season deniers.
As one such person, I can confirm: we are a small, proud, devoted (if not somewhat delusional) group. But we also know a secret that few others seem to understand.
Before I get to that, though, let me clarify. The group I’m talking about is those who drink iced coffee year round. I claim not to know anything about the cold-legged shorts wearers. Although I do wear shorts in the winter months sometimes. For example, if I’m stuck inside and doing something active, like cooking or cleaning.
And this is exactly the secret I’m talking about: winter only happens outside!
Everywhere else, it remains warm enough to drink refreshing smooth cold brew. At home. At work. Even in the car. Actually, especially in the car, after you’ve given it some time to warm up, when it becomes basically a mobile sauna.
What’s funny is that this secret hides in plain sight. Think about it. Do you bake your salads in the winter? Do you pour a bottle of Coca Cola into the kettle and set it to boil? Do you say to the bartender, “I’ll have the IPA, but nuke it on high for 45 seconds”? Sure, a hot toddy, a nice soup, or a steaming mug of hot apple cider is nice. but even in February, these things aren’t as ubiquitous as a glass of cold water and a deli sandwich.
In other words, it’s totally easy to normal to drink cold brew coffee year round. The only tough part is when you walk from the warmth of your car to the warmth of your house or your office with your cold cup in hand.

Alexa can’t rake leaves, and she’s terrible with a leaf blower. Ditto for scraping the frost from your car’s windshield.
You can ask her to help bring the potted plants in from the porch, and she’ll refuse each time, regardless of how polite you are. As if she doesn’t understand SHE works for YOU!
Alexa can tell you the Bolivian city Oruro’s population. She can tell you who serves at its mayor, or what kind of climate it experiences. She can probably tell you its exact coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. But she has no fucking clue where you put your damn sweaters after you moved this past summer.

Sous vide cooking is fun. It’s weird. It’s a lot different than most basic cooking methods. And because of that, there are tricks you’re bound to pick up along the way, little ways to improve your food’s flavor, or methods that maybe make it just that much easier.
Still, you’re bound to have some blind spots. Cooking is like having a problem to solve, the problem of how to get all these ingredients into a cohesive “meal.” As such, everyone’s going to come at it from a different angle. And knowing how another person approaches something might help you figure out the best way for you to do things. Thus, by giving your second Power Precision Sous Vide Cooker away to someone you know, you’re basically getting an assistant chef. Or maybe an IRL Youtube tutorial without the terrible five minute intro.

Dearest Martha,
I wish I could say that I miss you. Alas, to suffer only a heavy heart would be a great relief! The truth is much worse than that. I write this letter because I am in grave danger, and I fear that I will suffer not death, but something much worse: a living death of sorts.
Yes, “fear”: a word you likely never thought you would see your husband write. For eight months, I cohabited with wild gorillas. For eleven, I roamed with a pack of wolves. For three, I swam with electric eels. I was buried a whole year among the bulldog ants of Australia in an attempt to understand their tunnel structure. Never once, in any of those cases, did I feel even remotely afraid. But none of them compare to this.
Though it may void my contract with the research firm, I will give you the full details of my current assignment: I was sent to integrate myself into a community of EarPod wearers, so that I might discern once and for all what makes them such incredible assholes.
I have, for the last month, been living among them somewhere in the Bay Area in what I believe is an apartment, but also seems to be a concert venue and startup. The startup is focused on an app of some kind but no one here actually programs. They all work as “organic social marketing disruptors” though many also dabble, I’m told, in graphic design. They wear their EarPods always. And so do I.
This is what I mean by a living death, Martha. Since putting the EarPods in, I have begun to have thoughts that seem not to belong to me. At first it was just, PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT on a constant loop. But as I acclimated, I began to think things like It’s too bad the world isn’t as present as me, or My podcast is better than this one, or What idiot called these EarPods instead of Lil’ Listenies? The other day, I thought once again about them falling out, but this time, it was, If these EarPods fall out, what’s going to keep my head from floating away?

Unfortunately, I am not sure my exact address, so you will have to fly to San Francisco and look for posters for a show we are hosting, featuring a performance by an artist named Transl8. He does electro-folk, as well as politically-conscious trip-hop.
Also, please bring a pair of Rowkin Bluetooth Earbuds. Just as I needed to take measures in order to avoid the bends when I resurfaced after spending those weeks with the angler fish, so must I do the same now. And those Rowkins are stylish, wireless, and way less obnoxious than EarPods. They should return me to myself in no time.

Screenprint Sunday is back… or is it? Because we’re giving you an option this week: to logo or not to logo. That’s right, you can choose a 6-pack of fleece blankets with the Meh logo, or a 6-pack of fleece blankets with no logo at all.
So, on the one hand, this seems like a smart move for us. Not everyone wants a blanket printed with something, especially not a logo for a deal-a-day site. It can feel like you’re basically an advertisement.
On the other hand, it would be pretty insulting if you chose blank blankets over Meh-printed blankets. It’s the same price, so you’re basically saying, “I’d prefer not to be associated with you.”
On the other other hand, you’re saying you’d prefer not to associate with us every day you choose not to buy something.
On the other other other hand, maybe buying the blank blankets is more insulting, because you’re coming here, seeing what we’re selling, and saying, “We’re willing to take your blankets, but we don’t want to help you out with some free advertising.”
On the other other other other hand, you are paying us, which does help.
On the other other other other other hand, it’s not all about you. Or us. It’s also about what your friends and family members might want. Like, maybe they don’t prefer to use a blanket with a giant Meh logo on it.
On the other other other other other other hand, that leaves more blankets for you!
On the other other other other other other other hand, this is short term thinking. You might enjoy hoarding blankets now, but eventually the thrill will be gone, and you’ll be left with only blankets and no love. And besides, weren’t you just saying how lonely you were?
On the other other other other other other other other hand, no: it was not you who was lonely. It was me, the man with eight hands, six blankets, and no friends.
I hope this helps you decide which blankets to buy!"	0.07			2018-11-04T04:00:05.099Z	0.3967801951626992	0.94	56100

Think of your favorite Christmas mornings growing up: you woke up after barely sleeping, rushed to the tree, and tore open your presents. Then maybe came some reprieve–maybe you ate some pancakes and drank some hot cocoa–after which the real fun started: you spent the next several hours painstakingly assembling a tiny model from even tinier pieces so that it could sit atop your desk forevermore!
Okay, maybe that wasn’t exactly how it went. Probably, you played video games, or with some new action figures or dolls. Maybe you watched some movies on TV, maybe you ate more pancakes, drank some more cocoa, maybe you didn’t get out of your pajamas until four in the afternoon when it was time for Christmas dinner, and maybe you were ready for bed at seven, the calories and the sporadic sleep from the night before combining into a potent sleep aid.
And I wouldn’t blame you if that’s what you chose to do. Because those things are more enjoyable than building a model. But here’s something to think about: are they as satisfying?
Because there’s an important difference here. Yes, you might enjoy a candy bar more than taking a jog. Yes, you might enjoy bingeing ten seasons of some guilty-pleasure thriller on Netflix more than spending the afternoon preparing a five-course meal for your visiting relatives. And yes, you’re probably going to enjoy sitting around on the couch on Christmas overindulging in food, toys, and TV (or for adults: food, booze, and basketball) more than building the tiny model of the Eiffel Tower that you got in your stocking.
But you won’t be as satisfied.
Anyone who’s ever done anything requiring a modicum of will-power and ingenuity–even if only to solve a minor problem of their own making–knows that the accompanying frustration quickly gives way to a more lasting pride. Every deep breath you take all day will remind you of that jog. For weeks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment after making that meal. And while you might regret all of the pancakes and cocoa and movies and Christmas cookies well before December 26th, you will always be able to look at your model and think, with a smug sense of satisfaction, I did that.
And that is the greatest gift of all.

Ah yes, another gummy purporting to have some vague healing properties. Sounds like the perfect starting point for a rousing round of…
THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE
Here’s how it works: we give you the claim the product makes, explain why we’re more than a little dubious, and then in the end, we come to some conclusion (if ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ can be considered a conclusion). Let’s get started!
The Claim
CBD is “a natural constituent of hemp” that “has been shown to have positive health benefits.” But since it contains no THC, it won’t get you high. Thus, it supposedly can help treat stuff like pain and anxiety with less risk of endless philosophizing or nachos.
The Skepticism
Here are pretty much all of the things we can definitively say about CBD:

It is short for cannabidiol.

Did we get all that? Does anyone need anything repeated? In the back? Can you all hear me?
Okay, that’s a simplification. There’s more. For example, we also know that, like Hansel, this CBD shit is just so hot right now. According to a New York Times article by Alex Williams, Willie Nelson is launching a line of CBD-infused coffee beans (two of his favorite things in one cup, he says), Mandy Moore is toying with it to see if it helps relieve the pain of walking in heels, and Glamour magazine ran a story with the headline “I Replaced My Entire Beauty Routine With Only CBD Products.” I am linking it here as proof. I refuse to actually read it, which I consider an act of self-care.
But what does it actually… do? Gabe Kennedy a twentysomething CBD start-up founder offers this:

Comparing it to the feeling after an intense meditation or yoga session, Mr. Kennedy added that the CBD glow has “synergistic downstream effects” in terms of social connections. “Around others, I find myself more present and attentive, more creative and open.”

To put my reaction in terms that Mr. Kennedy’s ilk would understand, I’d say the ROI on reading that paragraph was that I experienced an exciting disruption in the mouth sector, which, had I not cupped my hand over my lips, might just have gone viral all over my keyboard.
But while it’s fun to mock the eye-roll parade that the article provides, it also validates the claim made by Christie Aschwanden over at FiveThirtyEight: “the marketing has gotten way ahead of the science.”
Aschwanden is definitely more focused on the what than the why. Her article’s thesis is pretty well summed up by its headline: “Does CBD Really Do Anything?” There are definitely some serious WTF moments in here too. For example, when CBD-pedaling doctor Joe Cohen makes the claim that it has anti-cancer properties and might even help with Alzheimers, Aschwanden raises concern that these effects weren’t discussed in two of the most significant cannabis-focused reports out there. The good doctor’s reply: “I think you just have to Google search it.”
Moreover, though, she raises some important points, most notably that we don’t have mixed messages when it comes to CBD; we have almost no messages at all, because very few tests have looked at it on its own:

Animal models and a few human studies suggest that CBD can help with anxiety, but those are the only conditions with much research on CBD in isolation.

Otherwise, most studies focus on cannabinoids more generally, where they have actually found “‘conclusive or substantial evidence’ supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain in adults, multiple sclerosis-related spasticity (a kind of stiffness and muscle spasms), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”
Though, this assumes you’re getting a real dose, which also seems to be up in the air:

There are no guarantees that the label accurately reflects what’s in the product. For a 2015 study published in JAMA, researchers tested 75 products [cannabis] purchased in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle and found that only 17 percent were accurately labeled. More than half of the products contained significantly lower levels of cannabinoids than the label promised, and some of them contained only negligible amounts of the compounds.

The Conclusion
When we promise something here, we hold ourselves to it, so here comes: after reading about CBD, we can say, conclusively, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . But actually, it seems not to be super risky and to have some potentially great outcomes. So if you’re feeling anxious or a little achy, give it a try. Like most of this stuff, if you don’t think of it as a cure-all, you should be fine."	0.06			2018-11-02T04:00:05.893Z	0.42612956253890216	0.93	66292

It’s easy to come up with jokes about these things, and not just because they’re called “Lovesac Sactionals.” Like, imagine replacing all of a friend’s furniture with these one night, so they awake and believe they’ve grown. Or imagine a business man who uses them in his office as a power move, so that whenever someone comes to meet with him, they have to sit crouched to the ground feeling small.
But really, this hilarious world I’m describing, where everything is out of proportion is actually what young kids experience all the time, just inverted.
As @Superllama7 helpfully points out, “kids and pets can also use adult-sized furniture.” This is true, of course. Yet adult-sized furniture doesn’t really give kids a sense of ownership. Kids have toys and books. They have a bedroom they might share, and a bed to sleep in. But rarely are they given their own little space for quiet comfort in daytime, which is too bad, because it’s something they might like.
@2palms’s daughter did, at least: “with the double-wide seat she can get a leg up, then camp out in the corner with her books.” If that sounds super cute, I’ve got news for you: it is. @2palms includes two adorable pictures of “quiet morning reading time” on one of the 2 “chaise lounges” they put together. (@2palms elsewhere describes the Sactional furniture’s sturdiness, in case that’s a concern).
We should add that this time around, we’re selling them a bit differently than we did in September. Instead of doing it piece-by-piece, we’re offering a few different packages. You can get:
2 Seats, 4 Sides: Great for the kid who will occasionally keep the company of a couple action figures, perhaps a teddybear, but also enjoys a quiet night in with a good (pop-up) book.

That’s ridiculous, Lucy. It’s 2018; you need furniture for casual get-togethers.
8 seats, 10 sides: Basically everything you need to build a simple playpen, except one that’s softer and won’t raise the ire of your interior decorator friends.
Are they incredibly practical? Probably not. But they’re nice, and who knows, maybe your kids have been jonesing for a little quiet, relaxing space to call their own."	0.05			2018-11-01T04:00:05.247Z	0.27079811590159353	0.91	64234

Ladies and gentleman, friends and enemies, lovers and fighters, today we offer you something incredible: control of our most essential invisible resource, the very air we breath.
Birds? They are mere riders of the sky, nothing more than hangers-on. Airplanes? For all of their ingenuity, their undeniable feats of engineering, they still must heed the air’s wishes. When the air says, I shall have a massive storm here, in your flight path, does the plane puff out its chest and cry, Not today, air! Your storm can wait? No! The plane says, Ah, yes sir, yes sir, whatever you prefer, air! We shall find a new way to where we are going! And if the air says, The storm will be massive; there is nowhere to go, the plane replies with a nervous laugh, and says, Of course, sir! Totally understandable, sir! Take your time, sir! We will be right down here on the ground if you need us, sir!
In other words, birds are nihilists and planes are weak-willed.
You are neither.
The air might find its way through some unseen passageway into your house in the dead of night, at the height of winter. And it may say to you, Behold my dryness! It may say, Watch, as your knuckles fissure and grow red! Watch as your skin flakes! Watch as your lips chap, even in here, where you thought you were safe from my wrath! It will cackle with bitter delight as it watches you apply lotion and balm, knowing they are like cheap bandaids in the shadow of its vengeance.
Then the air will feel something itself, a chill. But more than that: it will feel the slow in-creep of moisture. It will say, Is there some glitch in your heating and cooling system? And you will point to your Pure Enrichment Cool Mist Humidifier, and you will say, “No, there is no glitch at all.” Then you will say, “Now dance, air!” And it will cry tears of humidity, but it will dance!

I, Clive Grunley, am not a mere athlete. Nor a biathlete. Nor a triathlete or anything so simple. No sir, I am a sexdecathlete, if you know what I mean!
What I mean is I compete in competitions comprising of sixteen distinct athletic feats. Why do you look so surprised? Did you think a sexdecathlete was something else?
A traditional sexdecathlon begins with a twenty mile run (1). Next, is a swim of at least 4 miles (2), but additional miles can be swum to earn tokens which can be used to hire additional bridge builders to help you build the bridge (3) back over the body of water you just swam across.
After that comes the javelin toss (4), followed by a short sprint (5), in order so that you can catch the same javelin you just tossed (6), and then, while holding it aloft, discuss with several gifted undergraduates how the javelin can serve, in literature, as a metaphor for one’s ascension and subsequent decline (7).
This is followed by a water break, which is not a break as in a moment of reprieve, but another event wherein each competitor builds a mold, pours water into it, freezes it, and then breaks the sculpture upon the shoulder of a competitor before they have one broken over theirs (8). Those who lose are disqualified, and given a strong handshake by those continuing on (9).
Next, you chop down a tree (10), then climb at least halfway up the tree (11), and carve some part of the three into a surfboard (12) while it is falling, so that you have something to ride when your tree eventually lands in the wave pool. You then ride a wave (13) to the artificial “shore” wherein a meeting ensues among remaining competitors as to how you might maintain the tree-related events while also promoting sustainability (14).
Which leaves nothing to do but cross the finish line (15) and exchange high fives (16). Yes, these count as events, as the finish line is a moat filled with poisonous snakes and we call them high fives because they must be completed atop a nearby mountain of you and your high-fiving partner’s choosing.
Anyway, the point being: after a long sexdecathlon, I’m beat. And I need at least three Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Packs to sooth my aches. I especially like that the texture provided by the ceramic beads allows for a nice massage. And let me tell you, us sexdecathletes might all be different, but every one of us likes a good rub!

Four truths and three lies about the artist Adam Koford:


Adam Koford, as a shirt designer often under the moniker of “Apelad”, has sold more than 260 designs on websites like Shirt.Woot, including several that this former Woot copywriter often still thinks of and laughs aloud.


Adam Koford’s art studio is in a house boat currently floating in international waters, the only place he can execute his diabolical pencil hold without being taken into police custody.


Adam Koford was, for a time, a jockey. He and his horse Maple Syrup were dominant, winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. On the track of the Belmont Stakes, though, disaster struck. Just feet from the finish line, Maple Syrup collapsed in a cloud of gray smoke, at which point it was discovered Maple Syrup was not a horse at all, but a robot powered, at its center, by a tiny car driving on a tiny treadmill.


Adam Koford is the creator of Laugh-Out-Loud Cats, a webcomic which can be viewed at HOBOTOPIA.com, as well as in a new book, One More For The Road, COMING SOON (stay tuned to Hobotopia for an official announcement in a couple weeks). A few months ago, he posted his 3000th Laugh-Out-Loud cats drawing. And since pictures are each worth a thousand words, that means Koford has produced the equivalent of 3 million words, the equivalent of somewhere between 30 and 50 novels. That’s impressive!


Adam Koford opens bananas by making several exacting surgical incisions with a scalpel. The peel-removal process can take up to two hours, but according to Koford, it’s worth it. “If you respect the fruit,” he says, “it will in turn respect you by unlocking heretofore hidden flavors.”


Adam Koford has worked as a senior writer and story artist on the video game versions of Bolt, Toy Story 3, and Cars 2. Which means he can say things like, “I wrote Toy Story 3,” and not technically be lying!


Adam Koford designed today’s shirt.

There’s basic relief. And then there’s the relief of finding that perfect something you’ve been looking for: that hair gel that works just right with your hair; that pair of running shoes that seems to be custom-built for your unique foot shape; that cut of jeans that fits like a dream.

That little operation in your brain that you’ve been forever running in the background, looking for that special something, can be discontinued, the energy rerouted.

Many considered A Portal Among The Pages, published in 1978, to be the book that marked science fiction author Hal Pembry’s ascension from merely great into the canon. His previous seven novels to that point had been entertaining and thought-provoking, but few managed to evoke the magic that Portal  seemed to achieve so easily. As one reviewer wrote, “When Finley [the book’s protagonist] first finds the Encyclopedia of Time, he does not know that it functions essentially as a time machine, yet he senses something special between the covers. Readers might find this sensation quite relatable, as they sit in their favorite chair, holding Pembry’s masterwork aloft.”
His fans were eager to see what he would come up with next. And they were profoundly disappointed when the answer turned out to be: nothing. Pembry never wrote another book. In fact, he disappeared altogether. Many assumed he’d gone the way of other successful literary eccentrics–that the fame had been too much for him and so he’d retired somewhere quiet for a life of seclusion. Others posited that the terrible film adaptation had driven him to flee out of embarrassment. A small faction of particularly conspiracy-minded fans put forward a theory of murder at the hands of Kyle Tolliver, a rival author driven mad by jealousy because his own stellar novel’s release had been eclipsed by Portal (this being a pun many newspapers made while discussing the books’ relative sales, as Tolliver’s concerned a deadly solar eclipse).
None of these theories came close to the truth. In actuality, Pembry’s novel was a confession of what was to come: he’d discovered a way in which he could, through literature, bend time. I know because he told me when I spotted him last week outside of a used bookstore in Omaha. He did not look a day older than his author photo from forty years ago.
I asked what he thought of life in our current age and he said, “It’s okay. There are many things that science fiction foresaw, only different in minor ways. There are robots that work for you, but the one’s that move have no personality, and the ones with personality don’t move. They live in speakers and phones. And then there’s that.”
He pointed to the GOTRAX Hoverfly ECO Hover Board I had ridden up on.
“I’ve read all about those. About how their electrical safety is certified, about how they can go nearly 8 miles per hour and up to 12 miles distance before needing a charge. It’s truly a work of ingenuity. Only, when I and many of my contemporaries had imagined hover-vehicles, I thought they would truly hover. Again, it’s not that I’m unimpressed. Sometimes, I wish there was just a bit more whimsy. At any rate, I ought to be going.”
I asked him where and he corrected me. “It’s when,” he said, then told me to name a year. 1919 was what came to mind, and he took out a small unmarked book from his blazer pocket, opened it to a specific page somewhere in the middle. “Ah,” he said. “Interesting.” He pointed to a line written on the page. I tried to lean over and see but in that moment, there came a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew, Pembry was gone."	0.05			2018-10-26T04:00:03.801Z	0.24495605686952773	0.93	63926

We all have our preferences when it comes to luggage. Some of us prefer the hard-sided rolling bag. We like that what we see is what we get, that its shape remains steadfast always. We find comfort in knowing that our things will be safe inside. Perhaps we go on a vacation and buy a commemorative glass; with our hard-sided luggage we can be sure that it will be safe, as long as you don’t pack it too loosely. You don’t have to worry about some other bag in the cargo crushing it.
Others of us prefer the duffel. It’s casual but also classic. It can go down the street to the gym, or across the world to Shanghai. If you don’t have much to pack, it’ll take up less space. You can pack lightly or overpack a little bit. Its soft sides are forgiving. Also: they’re malleable. Pack one full of clothes, and you can squeeze it almost anywhere. It’s like a firmer pillow.
And yet…
There are times when we wish our hard-sided luggage had just a little bit more give to fit in the tight space behind the passenger seat of a fully packed car. And there are times when we’d like trust our duffel to hold its shape just a little bit more. For example, when we travel to wine country in Oregon, we want to bring back a bottle of wine, not a bag full of wet wine-scented clothing and some decorative shards of glass.
In other words: when it comes to bag-style our preference is not as firm as we might think. And facing this knowledge, it quickly becomes clear that the options aren’t hard-sided or duffel. They’re:

We can refuse to choose. We can eschew bags altogether. We can wear all of the clothes we want to bring on a given trip, layered over each other. The top layer can be pair of cargo pants and a hoodie with a big pouch. In the pockets: our toiletries, our travel knickknacks, our phones, etc.

Or…

We can choose both. As in, we can buy one of each: a U.S. Polo hard-sided bag, and a U.S. Polo rolling duffel. If we’re going for ten days at the vase expo, we can bring the hard-sided luggage. If we’re driving across the country and want something that’s easy to roll in and out of motels every night, we can take the duffel. But with both, we always have what you need.

Okay, fine. This is manipulative. If you really want to buy just one or the other, that’s fine too… But know this: some day, you might regret that choice–some day, you might need those hard sides or that soft top–and when that day comes, we won’t be able to help you.

There’s a double-standard here. If you buy a shirt that’s slimming and shave every day because your facial hair comes in patchy or comb your hair a certain way that looks best with your face-shape, it wouldn’t be considered inauthentic. If anything, it’s the opposite. It shows an intelligence, an understanding of what you have and what works best. Because none of those things are harmful or uncomfortable or particularly time-consuming. They’re just simple steps you take to look your best.
On the other hand, if you try to slow the thinning of your hair–or at least slow the appearance of your hair thinning–that’s considered inauthentic. It’s mocked. Men are told that going bald is embarrassing, but also that covering up baldness is embarrassing. Because it exhibits some denial of reality, a fight against what nature has intended for you.
To which, we reply: Yeah, no shit! And there’s nothing wrong with that!
Maybe at some point, we can all wear ponchos, choosing between three or four each morning based solely on thickness of material. Those who are not going bald will stop cutting their hair, and those who are going bald will allow their hair to recede without ridicule. We will all stop showering, and we will all stop brushing our teeth, and we will cease complaining about the natural odors of our bodies and breath. And if some lose their teeth because theirs are weak, they will drink only nutritional juice of a greenish-brown color, and no one will judge them for it.
Until then, we just gotta do what we gotta do to look whatever way feels best. And if that’s using a hair fiber and locking spray, so be it.
(And P.S., yes: given that we have out spoken against pseudo-science in the past, we did give a healthy amount of side-eye to the marketing copy that claims, “negatively charged Moroccan cotton fibers adhere to positively charged individual strands of natural human hair at the root for a noticeably fuller look.” But here’s the thing: there’s a difference in how harmful it is to say some fibers make your head look nice versus claiming an aligned chakra is the best arthritis medicine, so we’ll let it slide.)"	0.05			2018-10-23T04:00:01.475Z	0.3256555514094781	0.94	62467			0.10346348247905289

“No,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s little knights, I’m sure,” the exorcist said. “They ride in upon plastic horses and jab you with their surprisingly sharp lances.”
“It’s not them either,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s certainly dolls and stuffed toys,” the exorcist proclaimed. “Raggedy Annes and Andys, sock monkeys, and teddy bears, all singing ironic songs of friendship while stalking your every move, each brandishing pencils sharpened into shivs.”
“Actually,” the toy seller said, “it’s fidget spinners.”
“Wait, what? Fidget spinners? Seriously?”
“I’m afraid it’s very serious,” the toy seller said. “They just won’t stop… spinning.”
“That’s it,” the exorcist said. “They’re just spinning? Like fidget spinners do? But on their own?”
“Exactly! And I have work to do! But I can’t anything done! Because I’m so distracted by their infernal noises! Some of them even glow!”
The exorcist nodded. “I understand. They glow brightly with the spirits of the dead.”
“Nope,” the toy seller said. “They’re just the LED kind. And they don’t all glow very brightly. They’re pretty hit-or-miss, to be honest. A lot of them are fine, but the lights on some are dim, or out entirely. That’s why we’re selling them for cheaper than the non-LED ones.”
“Okay,” the exorcist said. “I think I know what to do. But I’ll need absolute privacy while I carry out the… um… exorcism. And I’m sorry to say, I’ll need to take the fidget spinners with me. To… ensure they don’t get possessed again or whatever.”
The toy seller did not object. In fact, he hugged him and thanked him with tears and his eyes. The exorcist assured him it would all be okay.

Welcome to everyone’s favorite day: Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, wherein we offer a new shirt or whatever every Sunday until, eventually, we get lazy or forget and it ends! Today’s shirt requires a little more explanation than the others. Basically, it’s the Casemates launch shirt, on royal blue… BUT you get a choice: the original sketchy version of the logo (and that’s sketchy as in sketch-like; not like, “it can’t be trusted”) or a new exciting more geometric-looking logo!
That leaves you with four potential purchase choices:
You Purchase The Classic Design
This the option for people who respect tradition. You want a shirt you can wear each night when you return to your victorian home and settle into your bergère chair to re-read Don Quixote. What’s that playing in the background? Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16, of course. And what’s that you’re drinking? Maybe a glass of 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir, or maybe a Boulevardier cocktail that you’ve been antiquing for a few days in a mason jar in the fridge. It all goes just smashingly with your new (or should we say old?) Casemates shirt!
You Purchase The New Design
Here, we have the modern choice. You’ll look right at home wearing this when you pull your electric car into the driveway of your house, a recent construction comprised, it appears, of only the most jagged of edges. Inside, you’ll ask your digital assistant to play the latest release from your favorite musician, a masked individual from a country far away who makes electronic music that is one step removed from the dial-up modem noise. Then you’ll settle in to read a collection of experimental prose poetry while sitting on a piece of brutalist furniture that might be a couch but also might be an end table; you can’t remember. What you are sure of: how comfortable you feel in your exciting new Casemates shirt!
You Purchase Both
This one goes out to all those who toe the line between classic and modern. You like mid-century modern furniture. You listen to blue-grass covers of new wave songs and new wave covers of blue-grass songs. In short, you appreciate all things: from the old and traditional to the new and innovative. If we may be so bold: this is definitely the best choice.
You Purchase Neither
This choice, on the other hand… well, it’s not really a choice at all. It’s the absence of one. You’ve essentially chosen not to choose. To put it bluntly, you are empty. You see stories about rescue dogs on Facebook and feel nothing. you stand directly in front of the elevator doors waiting for them to open, not because you’re in a rush, not because you think you’re better than other people, but because you haven’t thought at all. Often, you feel as though you’ve forgotten something. Your phone? No. It’s in your pocket. Your wallet? No. That’s there too. Your keys? No again. Really, you have forgotten nothing; instead, what you’re experiencing is the sensation of your being crying out to fill the hole where a soul should be.

Or maybe they could’ve called it a photo drone or a video drone, because it does have a camera that can take 1.3MP pictures and 720p videos. After all, drones are often used for photos or videos. My pretty basic wedding package featured a video done with a drone. Remember that shot at the end of 10 Things I Hate About You, of the band playing on the top of building while the credits rolled?

Still, what annoys me isn’t the how clear it is that this product was definitely named by some old dude thinking he’d discovered a new way to “reach the youth.” It had to be, by the way, because, say what you will about millennials, they at least know what a selfie is, and a photo that you need a drone’s angle to capture is not a selfie; it’s a photo with you in it. There’s a difference.
What annoys me is how reductive it is. It’s a dumb marketing 101. It thinks it’s carved out some entirely new lane in the drone game by catering to the selfie-obsessed among us, without taking into account the large number of people that it would turn off. Like, there are probably folks who arrived at the site today, read the product name, and said, “oh, no way,” and navigated away without reading another word. Or even if they did get further, they might still be thinking, It could be cool… but cool enough to risk my friends seeing a box that says “Selfie Drone” on it in the week before the recycling gets picked up?

Dear iRobot,
You’ve done what many companies aspire to do, but few actually achieve. In this stratosphere of success, your company is elite: Xerox, Kleenex, Ping Pong. Your product’s name–the Roomba–is now synonymous with (or maybe even supersedes) the “robot vacuum cleaner.” Congratulations.
And many of us here at Meh have been along for the ride since nearly day one. Yet, there’s something that’s frustrated us over the years: every time we sell a Roomba, we realize the model is slightly different than the previous one, despite looking almost exactly the same. We then dive into hours of research, hoping to solve the mystery of what’s so different in order to help our customers make an informed purchasing decision–only to find, in the end,  something trivial, like the canister capacity being one tenth of a percent larger than before.
What we’re saying here, iRobot, is: help us. Or, help us help you. Why not give every  new Roomba a feature that really STANDS OUT, so that they can be easily differentiated?
For example:


You could make one that says “sorry” whenever it bumps into a wall. An another that cries out in pain whenever it bumps into a wall. And another that recites a poem by Robert Frost in a Mike Tyson accent whenever it bumps into a wall.


Or a model that kisses your ankles when it goes by so that you know it loves you.


How about a Roomba that can take all the crumbs from the kitchen floor and forms them into new snacks for you to serve at your next party?


Maybe one Roomba could feature “pie warmth and texture.” And then the ""Plus ""version of that model could also feature “pie flavor.” And it could just be a pie.


Or what about a Roomba that just came with one completely functional human finger? Is that too much to ask?


Look, iRobot: the sensors, the 3-Stage Cleaning System, the ability to automatically adjust to any floor and navigate around furniture–that stuff is cool and all, but it’s also what we expect. Why not give people something a bit more unique? It would certainly be great for us. And if it’s great for us, isn’t it great for you too?
Just something to think about.

Twelve-year-olds Arthur and Lisa, having split up to cover more of the town, reconvened at the tree house to compare their trick-or-treat bounties. They’d both dressed as zombies, but even through all the gory face paint, their disappointment was clear.
“Another lame Halloween,” Arthur said. “It’s like, what’s wrong with giving out candy? Everyone around here tries to get too creative. I got the worst stuff.”
“You got the worst? Wait until you see what I’ve got,” Lisa said.
They sat down and began removing items from their respective glowing Pop Lights bags.
“Look at this,” Arthur said. “Someone gave me one Triscuit!”
“If you want something to dip it in, I’ve got a bunch of ketchup packets here from an old lady,” Lisa said. “Hey, what’s that sloshing noise?”
“Loose soup,” Arthur said. “The guy just ladled it into my bag.”
Lisa leaned over and looked. “Are those malt balls floating in it?”
“Nope. Meatballs. It’s Italian wedding.”
“At least you can eat that,” Lisa said. “I don’t know what to do with these ticket stubs from a 1992 Celine Dion concert.”
Arthur put on a pair of eyeglasses. “Let me see them.”
Lisa handed the stubs over. “I didn’t know you wore glasses.”
“I don’t,” Arthur said. “Someone on Fourth was handing these out.”
“New?”
“Gently used,” Arthur said.
“Maybe I could use them to read this.” Lisa pulled out a stack of papers from her glowing Halloween bag. “Guy on twelfth was giving out copies of his unfinished novel. And I need to have critiques back to him in two weeks.”
“How is it?”
“It’s okay. There are some point of telling issues. Like, if you’re going to use a retrospective POV, the narrator can’t be surprised by the events as they unfold. Also, some of the fantastical elements frustrate me. I keep thinking: what are the rules of this world?”
“Huh,” Arthur said. “I wouldn’t be much help. I’m a journalist, not a novelist. Or at least I am now that a woman on Church Street gave me this.” He handed a diploma over to Lisa.
“Wow, a journalism degree! From George Washington University! They could be really useful,” Lisa said, “for mopping up the soup!”
“Hey, good idea,” Arthur said.
“I have no idea what to do with this.” Lisa held a sheet of paper.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“An NDA,” Lisa said.
“For what?”
“I can’t tell you.”
The two of them fell silent for a moment.
“You want one of these I Trick-or-Treated 2018 stickers?” Arthur offered.
Lisa took one. “Thanks. You want any of these Spirit Airline points I got over on Main?”
“Sure. How about some opportunities to build real wealth and passive income through direct marketing? Someone on Grand was handing those out.”
“Couldn’t hurt,” Lisa said.
“That’s it for me,” Arthur said. “And to think: I thought my parents were the lame ones for handing out some fidget spinners they bought online. What a bust!”
“Actually, maybe it wasn’t a total bust. A family on Breezy Lane did give me this.” Lisa took it out and set it down between them.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“I think it’s another, smaller, Halloween.” Lisa pointed at something swirling. “See, look.”

Probably, we should lie. We should say that this is practical. We should say something like: you can garden from inside! We should claim something about how, with the success of HBO’s Sharp Objects, wealthy families have a renewed interest in dollhouses, and some of them are even hiring full construction crews to break ground and build them; get the heavy duty equipment your crew needs to beat out the other bidders!
But we won’t. Instead, we’ll look both ways, we’ll lean forward, we’ll gesture for your to lean forward too, and then we’ll whisper into your ear…
We’re selling this so you can give it as a gift.
We’re cautious to admit this because you know how people get. The holiday season is filled with camaraderie, but few forms are as cathartic as uniting against its annual encroachment. They’ve got the decorations up and it’s not even December, you’ll say to a stranger in the coffee shop. Are they playing “Jingle Bells”? Before Thanksgiving? someone will say in the checkout line at the grocery store. You’ll shake your head when Santa’s village appears in the mall before the first significant snowfall, or when you see a flyer informing you that Black Friday sales somehow start on Tuesday this year.
And here we are, making our first offering of the gift-giving season weeks before Halloween! What gall, you think. What nerve. But friends: hear us out. By offering this R/C Excavator today, we’re not trying to get a jump on anyone… but ourselves.
Though we don’t always act like it, at the end of the day, we’re a store. The holiday season should be our time to shine. And yet, to really “kill it” during the holidays, you need to be sure of yourself. You need to be organized, to know when things will ship and how long they will take to get to where they’re going. You need to build a balanced approached; you can’t just sell a bunch of toys or a bunch of electronics or a bunch of socks. You need to offer all three at different times based on sales trends from previous years.
But let’s be real here, Meh doesn’t exactly stand for “Meticulous, engaged, and hardworking.” It stands for… ummm… we don’t know. It was hard enough to come up with “Meticulous, engaged, and hardworking,” and honestly, now we could use a nap.

Two-for-Tuesday? Where’s the ambition in that? Yes, it sounds nice. But we can’t let alliteration lower our standards. So today, it’s four-for-Tuesday or twenty-four-for-Tuesday (which, I guess is technically alliterative).
That’s right, a choice between four or twenty-four. You know that means, it’s…
ORDER/HOARDER!!!
In these semi-regular sales, we provide two options: one a fair number of things for a good price; the other is an unfair number of things for a GREAT price. So, without further ado, let’s get started.
Today’s product is…
FLEECE BLANKETS!
I don’t know about where you all live, but here, the weather has taken a dark turn. It even snowed yesterday! Which means: it’s time to make a nice cup of tea or cocoa and bundle up under a fleece blanket on the couch with one to twelve dogs and/or cats for the next five months.
THE MATH
The four-pack will run you $14. That’s $3.50 per blanket. Not bad, right? But wait! The twenty-four pack goes for $60. That’s $2.50 per blanket. But wait even more! If the first four cost $14, that means the last twenty cost just $46, which is $2.30 per blanket! Does it make sense to break it down like that? Probably not! But that’s how we do it here on Order/Hoarder days!
WHAT TO DO WITH FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
With four fleece blankets, you can put one on the couch, one on recliner, keep one in the office, and still have a backup to rotate in when one is being washed. Or, store them all in a closet and break them out for a late fall bonfire.
WHAT TO DO WITH TWENTY-FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
So! Much! For example:


You could give them out as gifts to twenty-four of your favorite people!


Or, if you don’t have twenty-four favorite people, give them as gifts to twelve of your favorite people! (You can use the remaining twelve fleece blankets as wrapping paper for the other twelve fleece blankets!)


Send one to each venue on your favorite band’s 24-stop winter tour to show you’re a true fan!


Or, give one to all but four members of the twenty-eight piece Swedish indie pop group, I’m From Barcelona, in case they have to play any cold weather outdoor festivals! If they complain about not everyone getting a blanket, just tell them you’re not the idiot who decided to start a twenty-eight person band!


Use them to build a winter-ready tent in the bank yard! Actually, hell, you’ve got 24 fleece blankets! Build a winter-ready tent mansion!


Interior decorators will tell you that the right lighting can give rooms a soft, warm feeling; we say, why stop at lights? Why not take that “soft, warm feeling” over the top by wallpapering your house with fleece blankets?


See? Maybe twenty-four fleece blankets isn’t so impractical after all.
So, what’s it going to be: are you going to place a boring old order, or are you going to take the exciting first steps to becoming a fleece blanket hoarder?"	0.05			2018-10-16T04:00:03.596Z	0.3410857897640822	0.93	63281

Let’s start off general and work our way into more specifics. Every laptop manufacturer calls their product something different, but a Chromebook isn’t just a cool name. It’s actually a different kind of computer. Laptop Magazine sums it up nicely:

Instead of Windows 10 or macOS, Chromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. These machines are designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with most applications and documents living in the cloud.

In other words, if you live in a cabin somewhere in the mountains, and you have to hike and ski many miles back to civilization to grab a solitary bar of wi-fi, this might not be your best bet. Nor would it be a good option if you’re looking for a machine that can support your career cutting movie trailers and playing the latest computer games. These things are pretty sparse, in terms of power.
But for the rest of us, who pretty much never stray far from the router and who mostly use our computers for checking email, keeping track of things, writing, and organizing: a Chromebook is actually a pretty great, pretty cheap option.
And this one is actually both of those things: we’re selling it for just under $150, and on Amazon it has four stars on over 1,000 reviews.
Yes, if you want to be cynical, you could say: but wait, Meh, this thing came back out who-knows-when, and many of those reviews were written a while ago. And that’s true. BUT 1) there were still five star reviews coming in as recently as August of 2018; and 2) never underestimate the online reviewer. Like, these people self-identify as arbiters of all that is good (and not good) to buy; do you really think they wouldn’t rush to update their review the minute anything goes wrong?
Besides, let’s be totally honest: as much as we like to talk about the forward march of tech, most of us are still using our computers for the exact same things as we did five years ago. New apps come and go, but we’ll always need to make spreadsheets and type up documents and check our email.
Who knows? Maybe it’s a blessing it’s a little older: it might mean it was unaffected by the Gmail redesign. That’d be worth the price alone, if you ask us!"	0.05			2018-10-15T04:00:05.520Z	0.2839675274780344	0.93	64996

Mr. Khool was the coolest teacher at Meh High. He taught an elective called The Mathematics of Skating, a class he only managed to get approved after bringing the principal to a skate park and catching phat air while explaining how each side of a halfpipe was essentially a graph of exponential growth. Now, he was on his way to teach his first session of it when, rounding a corner, he heard stifled sobs.
Narf, hunched next to the water fountain, tried to straighten up when he saw Mr. Khool approaching. “Oh, hey, Mr. Khool. I was just… uh… making sure the fountains weren’t leaking.”
“Sounds like the only thing leaking are your eyes, l’il guy,” said Mr. Khool, crouching next to him. “You want to talk about it?”
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Narf said. “It’s just… well… I feel like when all the other kids ask for stuff, they get it right away. Toothbrushes. Jerky. Fidget spinners. But I’ve been asking for the same thing for years, and nobody takes me seriously.”
“I know what you’re going through,” Mr. Khool said.
“You do?”
“Sure! Being a cool guy is great, but sometimes it’s hard to get people to take me seriously. They think it’s all kick flips and cliff jumps, when really that’s only like 60 to 70 percent of what I do. There’s also a lot of hard work that nobody gives me credit for. But you know what? Whenever I start to feel like maybe it’s time to trade my longboard in for a Prius, I remind myself: there’s a reason progress and persistence both start with p. A friend of mine told me that once. His name was Tony Hawke.”
Narf’s eyes went wide. “Tony Hawk the skateboarder?”
“No,” Mr. Khool said. “This is Hawke with an e. He was Ethan Hawke’s second cousin. We played in a band together in college. And actually he went by Anthony.”
“So do you just call him Tony Hawke so people think you’re talking about Tony Hawk?”
“It doesn’t matter why I do it,” Mr. Khool said. “The point is, it’s a decision I made to call him Tony. And we all have decisions to make in this life. So, are you going to give up, or are you going to decide to keep chasing your dreams?”
Narf stood up. “You’re right! It doesn’t matter that it’s taken this long! I can’t give up now, not for anything!”
“That’s right! So, what is it that you’ve been asking for?”
“A cat shirt,” Narf said.
“Wait, seriously?” Mr. Khool said, getting to his feet. “But you’re Narf. You’re wearing a cat shirt right now. And you wore one yesterday. And the day before that. And actually every other day too. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the same cat shirt twice, now that I think about it.”
Narf slung his backpack over his shoulder. “Sorry, Mr. Khool. I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve gotta get to chem. Thanks again! You really said exactly what I needed to hear!”
“That’s great,” Mr. Khool said. “Although, maybe we need some other designs?”
But Narf was already off and running to his next class.

Douglas, We’re glad you’re here. We can see you’re confused, but don’t worry: all will be explained. You see, when LeAnn said to come home so you two could “take a scenic flight over a pristine lake” together, she was lying. This is an intervention. We, your friends and family–we’re all worried about you, Douglas.
It all began when you bought that Odyssey Stellar NX Drone. You said it was a way to bond with your son. But you didn’t let Trevor use it much, did you, Douglas? Still, it was a fun hobby for you. You liked that it came with a VR headset, so you could see from the drone’s POV. You would fly it, recharge it, fly it, recharge it, all day.
Only after a few months did we start to see the warning signs. You walked into furniture, cursing your legs. You started standing on the dining table to watch television. You called this “a more natural prospective.”
Then there was the mini drone that came with your purchase of the original drone. You started calling it ‘l’il guy,’ then ‘son,’ then finally you named it. It would’ve seemed cute, if you didn’t choose, ‘Trevor,’ the same name as your real son.
Yes, Douglas, that’s right: only one of them is your real son. Because you are not a drone, Douglas! You are a man! You might spend days coming out of drone-prospective for only as long as it takes your Odyssey to charge. You might spend these times with your eyes closed tight, whispering, “it’s a dream, it’s just a dream,” so as not to face the fact that you are a human being, and as such, you are bound by gravity to remain on the ground.
But it’s not healthy, Douglas! You have a family! You have a job! You have obligations! You can’t just ignore them because you have “a new life in the sky” now. It can be a fun hobby, but you’ll never really be a drone, Douglas. You need to start seeing that. And moreover, you need to apologize to all of us for what you’ve put us through.

User @alacrity wants one thing and one thing only: a margarita.
When we sold a Copper Cookware set, they wrote:

well, I guess I could serve margaritas in these…

On a two-pack of posture trainers:

it has to be said: these make really shitty margaritas.

For a 2-pack of cast aluminum skillets:

well, I guess I could drink a margarita out of em… but there’s still the salted rim thing.

A coffee maker:

this will make very hot margaritas.

Earrings:

these are absolutely useless for margaritas.

You might notice that these are not all sales from the last few months. No, @alacrity has lived with desire for years. But that will change today. Because today we are selling a Cuisinart Waring Pro Blade Blender.
And yet the story does not end here. What we want to know is: how does @alacrity feel about this?
Will they arrive at the site today relieved? Will they cry aloud, “For many years I have wished for nothing more than a sweet lime-rich tequila cocktail. And at long last, the great Meh has delivered to me a device that shall itself deliver me to my own personal paradise. Thank you, Meh! Thank you so much!”?
Or will they feel some resentment? Will they realize, all too late, that the real margarita was the friends they made along the way? Or, to put it differently: is there any margarita that’s as sweet on the lips as camaraderie is to the heart?
And yet, there remains a fact we have not reconciled: uhh, like, hello? We’ve sold blenders before!
So perhaps we’re misreading @alacrity. Perhaps, they do not hope for their own margaritas at all. Perhaps they seek only to be a sort of margarita-specific town-crier, to stand in the virtual park at the center of Meh and warn all those around them about the dangers of attempting margaritas in products not optimized for margaritas.
And then of course, there is the final possibility: maybe @alacrity prefers margaritas on the rocks.
So what is it? Only time will tell. And by time, we mean: hopefully @alacrity in the forums."	0.05			2018-10-12T04:00:20.860Z	0.34750686103289724	0.94	59130

Watches? I never wear watches. Why would I wear a watch in the age of cellphones? That’s what I say. Because I believe in efficiency. It guides my every waking move, from the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the time I lay down to sleep at night. (That’s the alarm on my phone, by the way. Why have an alarm clock when you have a cell phone?)
But it’s one thing to say you believe in efficiency, and it’s a whole other thing to live by it. I know because I do. To prove it, I’ll run through my average morning:
First thing’s first, I make breakfast. It’s the same every day: spaghetti and meatballs. I have it for lunch too. And dinner. Food is food, isn’t it? Why should I have different foods for different meals?
When I’m done eating, I floss and brush my teeth, then spit into the drain in my shower. Because why have a sink when you have a shower? Is not a shower a human-height sink? Think about that for a second. Anyway, when I’m done brushing my teeth, I wash my hands with shampoo. Soap-products are soap-products, after all! Then I shave, checking my reflection in the mirror–by which I mean, my phone, on selfie mode.
A little bit of leisure time is part of being efficient too. So, before heading out the door to work, I take twenty minutes to relax. I might watch a show (on my phone) or read a book (on my phone). But soon enough it’s time to check the weather (on my phone). To confirm the app, I look out the window–the single window I have in my whole house. Why do I need to see out my house from so many different sides? Outside is outside, no matter what way you’re looking at it. One window is plenty.
Using this information, I decide what I’m going to wear: pants or shorts. I should elaborate; it’s the one garment, but it’s got a zipper so I can unzip them at the knee when it gets warm. It’s the same pair I wear every day, because again, for me it’s all about efficiency. Not everyone is a fan of this. My sister, for example, once said she actually hated my zip-on pant-shorts. She said I should switch things up by wearing something else sometimes. She said that by wearing them I was ruining her wedding. Can you believe that?
She hasn’t spoken to me since then, but I don’t mind. I still have another sister, and honestly, at the time, I was in the middle of a painful decision of which sister I would keep. Two sisters? Are you crazy? Who needs all that in your life?
Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh, right: these watches. Yep, don’t need them. Although, they would go nicely with the one sweatshirt always I wear, especially on days when it’s hot enough that I have to roll up the sleeves. And if you’re wondering why I don’t just take it off, it’s simple: I’m not wearing anything underneath. Wearing a shirt under what is essentially another shirt? That’s nuts!"	0.06			2018-10-11T04:00:06.347Z	0.3548942995103143	0.93	61867

Imagine for a moment you’re a secret agent. You’ve been called upon to infiltrate a very important party held by a tycoon with designs to take over the world. You need to take a video of the party, so key attendees can be identified, and hopefully sneak into the study where you’re told the plans for the doomsday device are kept. For this mission, you’ll be provided with a PogoCam. It’s smaller than a tube of lip balm, attaches magnetically to your favorite pair of glasses, and shoots 5 megapixel photos and 720p HD videos. You just need to go to Q to collect it.
FYI: in this imagined scenario, Q refers to the dumpster behind the Qwikmart convenience store down the block, not the genius gadgeteer from the movies. Because, boy oh boy, would that guy steer clear of this thing.
In fact, over on Amazon the PogoCam only has 2.5 stars. That’s some real ruh-roh territory, especially given most products fall into a 3 star rating just by being delivered. People who bought it without the Pogotrack sunglasses offered here griped about the safety loop required when using your own pair.  Others complain about the picture quality or that it only takes 30-second video clips.  One user goes even further: “while I have little proof,” LE says, “[I] believe PogoCam has been the cause of much of the world’s turmoil lately.”
Not great!
But here’s the thing: since it’s come out and been revealed to be of less than desirable quality, the PogoCam’s price has tanked. In fact, I’m told that at one point is retailed for as high as $150. That’s nuts. But even with all those price drops, it’s still just shy of 50 on the 'zon.
We’re selling it for $24. For that price, it can just be a fun little gimmicky impulse buy. Wear it once or twice and you’ve pretty much justified the purchase. If you get it to work better than a bunch of Amazon reviewers and find some real use for it, awesome! If not, at least you got some sweet magnetic sunglasses out of the deal.

There were only two of them in the conference room, but when the engineer placed the SmartStand prototype on the table, his hands still shook with anxiety, as if he were making a presentation to the entire company. In a way, he was. Across the table sat the founder and CEO.
“Looks simple.”
“Just as you asked, sir,” the engineer said.
“So let’s talk features,” said the CEO. “It can hold your tablet or phone while you’re cooking, so that the recipe is easy to read?”
“Yes, sir,” said the engineer.
“And it tracks the ingredients used, placing orders based on what’s running low in your cabinet and refrigerator?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it intuit how romantic a given meal seems, and adjust the room’s lighting accordingly?”
“No, sir.”
“Does it feature an olfactory sensor that reads the smell of the meal and gives spicing advice?”
“No, sir.”
“Let’s talk about travel use: on an airplane, it can hold up your phone or tablet making it easier to watch a show or movie?”
“Yes, sir.”
“And it can place drink orders with the flight attendant, based upon the mood of said show or movie?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it message the gate attendants of your connecting flight, informing them when delays get in the way of your lunch or dinner plans, so they know to have a torta from Frontera waiting for you?”
“No, sir.”
“Tell me that it can at least read the forecast for your destination and place orders for weather-appropriate pants.”
“It can’t, sir.”
The CEO stared for a long time at the prototype. “So, it’s not ‘smart’ at all?”
“Well, sir,” the engineer said, “I like to think of it like this: by adding a number of attention-grabbing but ultimately unnecessary and overcomplicated ‘smart’ features, we’d only introduce the possibility for bugs and glitches. Not to mention we would have to put out different models for different phones and tablets. So, despite how it may seem, this is a ‘smart’ product, in that simplicity is smart, because it leads to ease of use and universal compatibility.”
The CEO pounded his fist on the table. “I like that! I like that a lot! Not smart is actually smart! That’s great! That’s gonna help me a lot, not just at work, but also in my personal life!”
“Actually, sir, what I said was simplicity is–”

We’re entering the time of year when everything freezes and dies and allergies are replaced by a sense of tired dryness. For some of you, this might be a relief. And yet, consider these two things: first, said dryness does nothing to dry up non-seasonal allergies, like those related to pets; and second, spring will be back sooner than you think with its pollen-thick air. And just like the smart shopper buys next year’s wrapping paper the day after Christmas when it’s marked down to nothing, so too does he or she purchase an allergen-optimized vacuum just as allergy season winds down.
And boy oh boy, does this thing suck up allergies. In fact, it “captures and traps 99.9% of dust and allergens down to 1 micron.” As a non-allergy-sufferer myself, I don’t know exactly what that means. I can tell you that, given the the word “micron” is pretty much just “micro” with an n, it sounds pretty small.
What I actually CANNOT understand is what the fuck “MultiFLEX Technology” is. I know that it “provides flexible reach for under furniture and freestanding, compact storage.” But what does that mean, exactly? Digging a little deeper, I found that the “MultiFLEX wand bends so you don’t have to, reaching under low lying furniture with ease.” So, apparently, it’s a kind of semi-flexible wand? That’s it? Seriously?
But friends, I’m not mad. No, not at all. In fact, I think it’s smart. Genius even! Every feature of every product, regardless of how mundane, should get the marketing-speak treatment. For example:

Yes, on one level, the design is simple: it’s the Meh face, or should we say, the many (meh-ny) Meh faces you see when you come to our site. It’s a button. You press it. You keep a streak going, if you want. Or else you don’t; you reserve the Meh button only to show your nonplussedness. It’s something that makes our site special, a little inside joke among you, the customer, and us.
But, on another level, the design means so much more. It’s a tribute. To us. And all we’ve done for the world of commerce. Before we came along, all was excitement, and much of it was false. Companies didn’t know that it was fine enough to be, well, fine enough. Everything had to be glorious and exuberant. But then we showed up, and we taught people that it doesn’t always have to be that way. You don’t have to worry about moving the proverbial needle. You don’t need to dial it up to a ten. You can hang out at a five if you want.

It’s pretty simple, except for one wrinkle, which is that you get to choose what capacity power bank you want: 4200, 6000, or 9000 mAh. Now, most modern phones can be fully charged with between 2000 and 3000 mAh, which means even the smallest power bank we’re offering can charge your phone somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times. By that standard, you could get 2.5 to 3 full charges with a 6000 mAh power bank, and 4.5 to 5 with the 9,000.
But look, we’re not going to spend the next few hundred words talking math. It’s too abstract. The most helpful thing to do would be to provide brief profiles for who might require each power capacity, so that you identify yourself among them. Here goes:

You’ve got a full day ahead of you, enacting archaic rituals and making shady transactions in a number of parks in and around Cincinnati. And let’s just say the Corrigans didn’t factor in any time for you to stop and juice up your phone.

You find that you have an intense desire to work out. You go running and clock 18 miles easily. The next day you go further. And further after that. Soon you’re running up mountains just to get your heart rate going. You’ve made partner at the firm, which is crazy because you don’t remember becoming a lawyer. The paychecks are amazing.

Each year, representatives from all 50 European countries gather for the EuroSock Summit to discuss potential changes to the sock’s age-old design. Here is a summary of year’s Summit, which took place in Luxembourg in a chamber deep inside the Grand Ducal Palace:


The representative from Sweden proposed changing the design, so that the sock appeared strangely both modern yet antiquated, like a torture device, but also attractive and entirely comfortable. Motion failed to pass by a vote of 11 to 39.


The representative from Italy proposed making the next EuroSock as soft as the richest pillowy ball of burrata, as delicate to touch as the most sumptuous pluck-able leaves of basil, and yet as firm as tagliatelle cooked to a perfect al dente. Also: more garlic. Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 19 to 31.


The representative from France proposed making the sock from a distinct material that would grow delightfully crusty over night, so to it could be enjoyed the next day. There was some confusion over this, but eventually the representative from France admitted she was simply hungry, having been disappointed in her hotel’s bread options that morning at breakfast. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Norway proposed making the sock seven times thicker. When someone suggested he have multiple pairs of socks–some for summer, others for winter–he smiled and nodded, saying, “Yes, exactly! These would be for summer!” Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 3 to 47.


The representative from Ireland proposed making the socks out of a darker fabric, one “as pitch black as a Guinness.” The representative from Belgium chimed in to add that the fabric should be strong, “not unlike a delicious quadrupel.” The German representative also leaned forward to propose adding a pinch of sea salt, “one of the key ingredients in a traditional gose.” When they all three broke down laughing it became clear that they’d partaken in a few of the aforementioned beverages during the break for lunch.

When I first saw that we were selling an air fryer, I was torn.
On the one hand, Wirecutter pretty emphatically stated that they don’t recommend these things for how expensive they are. If you’re not familiar with Wirecutter, they’re basically one of the best and most straightforward resources for when you’re buying kitchen appliances, electronics, and just about everything in between. They do a lot of research and provide simple, easy-to-understand articles replete with concrete purchasing recommendations. So, their opinion carries a lot of weight.
On the other hand, my dad has an air fryer and he likes it.
Two venerable sources. Two contradictory opinions. I didn’t know who to trust. So I began to dig deeper. Here’s what I found:


While working on his Wirecutter article, Michael Sullivan conducted more than 35 hours worth of air fryer tests. In the end, he was so unimpressed with them that he recommended buying a simple convection toaster oven to get a better bang for your buck.


Back when I was in high school, my dad used to change my car’s oil. Not just check it, mind you, but perform a full-blown change. He had a little pit in the garage, so you could pull your car right in and he’d take care of it every 3000 miles.


Given those two facts, I came to the following conclusion: it was possible that my dad had also used his air fryer for 35 total hours, yet it was very unlikely that Michael Sullivan had ever changed the oil in my car when I was in high school. This seemed like a pretty clear “checkmate” situation. But then I remembered that an air fryer’s greatest selling point is its oil-free frying. Thus, it only seemed fair that all oil-based arguments need be discarded. I found myself right back at square one.
Then it hit me: my dad is a Meh customer. He likely bought his air fryer right here on this very site. Meanwhile, Wirecutter suggests a model that retails at about $250, which is FIVE TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS ONE. Furthermore, they never say they’re outright bad; they just say they aren’t worth the money. Which makes sense: my dad would likely not be the satisfied air-frying customer he is today had he been required to fork over more than 200 bucks.
Therefore, Wirecutter, I know we’ve suggested this before, but if you’re reading this, consider an addendum to your initial verdict of “Not recommended”: something like, “unless it’s selling on Meh for almost a fifth of the cost, in which case, go to town.” I’d be happy to put you in touch with my dad if you need any more information."	0.05			2018-10-03T04:00:13.622Z	0.4058992852291472	0.92	65054		0.15524434813545068

In the grand scheme of things, I’m pretty smart about health stuff. No, not necessarily among other humans. I mean in the REAL grand scheme, as in: among all living creatures in the world. I sometimes eat too many donuts, or drink so much coffee that I give myself a headache. But I at least KNOW what I’ve done immediately after I’ve done it. And compared to my cats or my dog, I come out looking like a friggin’ genius!
For example, I won’t find my way into the trash and attempt to consume a giant wad of paper towels that were used to soak up frying oil, only to slink behind the couch and embarrassedly vomit it up. And if I found myself stuck in a bathroom, I would wait patiently until someone got home and ask them for some help. I would not, under any circumstances, try to EAT MY WAY OUT, causing enough damage so that both the door and the trim need to be replaced, and giving myself a pretty rough tummy ache along the way. Another point in my favor: I understand the utility of pills as well as the ease with which they can be taken. They don’t need to be hidden in cheese or loaded into a little plastic contraption to be shot deep into my throat in order to induce swallowing. I just take them!
And yet, even as I type these gloating words, I’m sitting in a rickety wooden chair, leaning awkwardly over my laptop. Unlike the damage of a few too many donuts or a bit too much coffee, I won’t feel the effects of my bad poor posture for many years. And yet, I know this, but I do nothing to correct it.
In a way, poor posture is like the human version of eating out of the garbage. We just can’t help it. Instead of taste-testing rotten meat or chewing on plastic bags, we hunch. And just as pets need help learning what they should and should not do, often for their own good, so do we.
That’s where this this Posture PT Confidence Corrector comes in. It can fit onto just about any chair–from office chairs to the driver’s seat of your car–and it improves posture, which in turn strengthens your core and reduces lower back and shoulder pain. Or, to put it differently, it’s not unlike a spray that makes bad posture smell like sour apples!
Okay, that’s going a little overboard with the pet metaphor thing. It’s not a spray. It’s a posture corrector. Sorry for the confusion. Now buy one, and straighten out your life. Got it?"	0.05			2018-10-02T04:00:03.835Z	0.31486252125742953	0.93	62431

Today’s sale leaves us conflicted. On the one hand, this would seem like an Order/Hoarder sale: you’re given options, some more reasonable than others. On the other, it’s not exactly the same as past Order/Hoarder sales we’ve offered. For example, there are more than two options. So, if you don’t mind, we thought we could work through this together, with a little Q&A:
How does the math break down?
This is a little more complicated than usual. You can get a 40 pack of basic fidget spinners for $14 ($0.35/spinner) or a 40 pack of LED fidget spinners for $16 ($0.40/spinner). But you could also get a 160 pack of both LED and basic fidget spinners (an 80 and 80 split) for $34. Which is about $0.21 per spinner… except, if you think about it: the first 40 basic spinners cost $14 and the first 40 LED spinners cost $16, which adds up to $30. So that’s a mere $4 for the last 80 fidget spinners, or a nickel per! CRAZY!
So then why wouldn’t this be an Order/Hoarder sale?
For three reasons:


As mentioned above, it’s not an either/or. There are three options.


40 fidget spinners will already have you well on your way to hoarding fidget spinners; but, more importantly…


These aren’t really for hoarding! We’re offering them now, because we want  to get them to you with plenty of time to spare before the end of the month. That way, you can offer them out to Trick Or Treaters on Halloween. That doesn’t sound very hoarderly at all, does it?


Why wouldn’t you just give candy away on Halloween like everyone else?
Because fidget spinners are fun and will last longer. Also, this site is run by someone from Saint Louis where some people give out jokes instead of chocolate, so it’s kind of on brand for us to eschew the national standard for Halloween practices.
Wait, back up: what even ARE fidget spinners?
They’re goofy little spinny toys with no real purpose other then to be fidgeted with.
That’s sorta dumb, isn’t it?
You might think so, but in a world where people try to sell peppermint-scented oil as an alternative to physical therapy, I find it refreshing that there’s a product out there that’s explicitly for useless goofings-off.

You might wear the shirt proudly at first: to work, or out to grab drinks with friends, or when you’re on vacation, or when you’re visiting family. The people around you might ask, “Who made that shirt?” And you might respond: “Meh.” But really, you’ll want to say: “Me. I made it. Or I made it possible.

On September 13th, user @djslack offered up a list of potential things we could sell, including “some kind of interesting jerky type product.” And so here we are selling delicious Wicked Cutz jerky!
Now, we need to make two things clear:
First, this is some pretty classy jerky. Therefore, the price tag isn’t going to be exactly in line with the Slim Jim that you buy on a whim as you check out at the grocery store, only to open it in your car and for the noxious smell to make you regret your decision, although not enough to stop you from eating it. Hypothetically speaking. Point is: this is good jerky and good jerky costs money.
Second, and more importantly: we need to make something EXCEEDINGLY clear. We saw @djslack’s suggestion and considered it, but the decision to sell the jerky ultimately came down to us and us alone. In fact, there’s a chance that we subconsciously were thinking about selling jerky and so @djslack didn’t exactly give us the idea as much as surface it.
What we’re saying is: we’re not necessarily in the business of outsourcing our product selection. As in, we don’t do requests. As in, don’t get used to this, okay? Because this is it. The party ends here.
We say this because ever since we sold some toothbrushes as a joke–that’s right, it was a joke! A joke ON YOU!–we know there have been rumblings on the forums about something you’d like us to sell. That’s how obstinate we are, people: we won’t even name the item. We won’t even write the word. Because we are unmovable.
We’re like a brick wall. People always tell us that. They say, “Talking to you all is like talking to a brick wall.” Which we take as a compliment concerning our strength. And also our attractiveness, given that brick is a very beautiful building material. In certain cases, at least. Maybe not in some of the suburban architecture of the mid-fifties. But then again, those homes have a certain nostalgic beauty in a way. There’s a pure American warmth to them, isn’t there?
What were we talking about? Right: how we’re not a bunch of pushovers, and you can’t boss us around and tell us what to sell!

Dearest Professor Alba,
First off, a hearty congratulations on winning the Henning Prize. Your self-adhering bow-tie is certainly a masterwork, and the award is absolutely deserved. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the ceremony. As I am sure you are aware, since my expulsion, you are my sole correspondent from the Meyer Institute of Alchemic Fashion. But my choice not to attend is not due to some fear of seeing my former classmates and teachers again–or, more accurately, of experiencing their fear as they witness me. No, I cannot attend because I have fallen ill, and I fear this may be the last letter I ever write.
Although, perhaps ‘fallen ill’ is a simplification, as the illness under which I suffer has no name.
The trouble began in my makeshift lab late one night. I was working on a new stitch technique, making minor tweaks to it here and there over the course of several weeks. It was going nowhere, and after one particularly long day toiling in the haberdashery (with no Meyer Certification, I am forced to do such menial labor), I came home so exhausted and angry that I decided to throw it all away in favor of something entirely new.
I am sure you will be disappointed to hear this. During my expulsion hearings, you were the strongest voice in my favor. When the administration said that I “endangered” all those around me with the “diabolical recklessness” of my work, you told them it was just a phase. But Professor Alba, it was not. And while I am not proud to admit that, I am also not exactly not proud either.
For that evening, in my lab, I created something amazing: a stitch unlike any other stitch; a stitch that seemed to take time into it, that seemed to steal tiny slivers of the universe’s fabric and convert them into pure style. It was a stitch that resembled a stitch in only an ethereal way, like a word in another language whose definition we can on some level understand but for which there is no direct translation. I sewed up some pairs of socks with the stitch; despite using bland monochrome fabrics, each pair came out patterned with a bold unpredictable design.
I learned all too late that it was taking something from me as well, that it was essentially draining my life energy, weaving it among each sock’s seams. I fashioned a lead coat to wear while working, but it was too late. The damage has been done. I write this letter to you from bed, Professor Alba, a bed from which I fear I may never again rise. Indeed, just the act of writing has left me pale and exhausted.
But this is not a letter merely bidding farewell to you and this world. You will find, in the envelope, the detailed plans for the aforementioned stitch (as well as for the protective coat). I cannot say what I want for you to do with them. Some days I hope you will set them aflame and think of them no more; other days I hope you will use them to start a line of vibrant and delightful socks to sell around the world.
But, Professor Alba, promise me this: if you choose the latter, make sure to warn the people, to let them know the truth, that these are not simply stitched socks.

This compact first aid kit is exactly what it says it is: a small kit for administering first aid. It has tweezers. It has scissors. And it has one bazillion (read: 121) pieces, including all the gauze, pads, bandages, and alcohol prep packs that you’d need to treat any (read: any NOT super major) wound you sustain while camping, or picnicking, or what have you. Its size makes it the ideal first aid kit to buy, leave in your car, and just forget about until you need it.
That’s all pretty simple.
But what comes next? This is what no one ever talks about: how to build and successfully administer a second aid kit. Luckily, we can help.
Step 1: Gather your supplies. You will need a chair (worn, in an endearing, well-loved way); a blanket (soft, warm, but not too warm); a cat (purring); and a remote control (to a Roku, Apple TV, or comparable).
Step 2: Apply ass to chair. (Optional, recline chair or use ottoman to extend legs).
Step 3: Apply blanket to lap and/or legs.
Step 4: Apply purring cat to blanket at lap area. Pet cat occasionally.
Step 5: Apply hand to remote; locate a binge-worthy show on your television; press play.
Step 6: When your significant other or roommate enters the room and asks if you’re really going to spend all day just sitting there watching television, sigh and say, “You’re right,” then move (very slightly) to get up, stopping only to hiss with pain and grasp at the injury area where the first aid was administered. (Optional: parlay sympathy, if shown, into your significant other or roommate bringing you a hot beverage of your choice: coffee, tea, cocoa, or apple cider.)
Step 7: When your significant other or roommate leaves the room, replace purring cat (if riled by your attempt to get up), rewind show as needed, and resume viewing.
There: you’ve successfully built and administered a second aid kit. Now, just buy this compact first aid kit, and you’ll be all set!"	0.04			2018-09-25T04:00:05.576Z	0.2809856978279806	0.95	74445

Overview: Very good, but not as good as Michael Keaton!!!
Before I get into my review, I want to give you a little bit of background: I’m a huge Michael Keaton fan and a software developer. Recently, I sold my start-up to a large tech conglomerate for several million dollars. I used that money to build a bunker inside an abandoned warehouse where I would live and wait for Michael Keaton to arrive so I can ask him a few continuity-related questions about his seminal 1996 comedy, Multiplicity, for my podcast: The Podkeast. I won’t list the questions here because I am certain they’ve never been asked and I want to be sure I’m the ones who asks them (more on this below, when I get into the complaints).
I need peace in my bunker to record episodes of The Podkeast and also to meditate and prepare myself for the eventual interview. Luckily, it’s soundproof. That brought up another issue, though: if I can’t hear anything, how will I know when Mike (that’s what I call him in my head sometimes) has arrived?
That’s where The Lynx 1080P Camera comes in! The quality’s great, they’re easy to set up, there’s free cloud storage, and most importantly, it has facial recognition. Using photos, I trained mine to only recognize one face: Michael Keaton’s. Thus, I’ll get a check-in notification whenever he arrives (fingers crossed, any day now!). Any other unfamiliar face alerts that come through I just ignore, because like I said, I don’t need the distractions.
I should say: I do have two complaints. One is that the Lynx recognizes faces really well, but not always the material said faces are made of. What I’m getting at is that my mom keeps showing up in a really realistic Michael Keaton mask (she probably bought it with the start-up money I gave her, ugh!). She always says the same thing: that she’s worried I might be losing my mind. It makes me want to scream. Like, of course I’m losing my mind! I got a check-in notification and thought Michael Friggin’ Keaton was here! And sometimes I do scream. Hey, it’s a sound-proof bunker, gotta get your money’s worth, right?
The other complaint I have is that Michael Keaton has not shown up to do the interview with me. This is probably more a don’t-have-Michael-Keaton’s-contact-info problem than a Lynx problem, but still: with that AND the mask issue, I didn’t feel right giving it five stars.
Overall, though, a very good camera!"	0.05			2018-09-24T04:00:11.601Z	0.2044531578210335	0.94	74861

When it comes to celebrating milestones, different people demand different amounts of ceremony. Some will require you to wear tuxedos and dinner gowns to the their wedding in a restored factory-turned-theater-space, wherein they will prepare a choreographed song and dance commemorating the various defining moments of their relationship. Others will go to the courthouse, sign a few documents, and send a text imploring you to meet them for beers later.
Whether it be a birthday, a successful defense of a PhD dissertation, or a housewarming party–everyone’s a little different. Not everyone wants gifts. But herein lies the one consistent rule, regardless of an event’s formality: if you’re bringing a gift, you have to put it in something festive. Because even the most casual soon-to-be mom isn’t going to stoked when you show up with a onesie still in the shipping box from VintageOnsiesRUs․com.
The problem? Wrapping is stressful. Wrap a gift poorly and you look like a degenerate. Wrap a gift too ornately and you seem like a bit of an over-achiever. Besides, not everything is easy to wrap. If you want to wrap an overstuffed plush starfish, you can either a) put it in a box and wrap that, or b) get your friend who’s an aerospace engineer to help you get the measurements and scissor placement just right so that it doesn’t come out looking like garbage.
Really, your best bet is to put that overstuffed plush starfish into a gift bag. Because the gift bag always looks good. It’s as fun-looking as wrapping paper and as easy as a shipping box. Plus, getting a gift in a gift bag rules. You’re basically getting two gifts, one of which you’re more than encouraged to regift later when you need to give someone else a gift.

You’ll notice that you have two choices on today’s sale. One is reasonable. The other is unreasonable. Or should we say: the other is an UNREASONABLY GOOD DEAL! You know what that means. It’s the return of:
ORDER/HOARDER
For those are unfamiliar, Order/Hoarder is when we offer you two options: a normal number of things for a good price, or an abnormally large number of things for a GREAT price. Today’s product:
Cooling towels!!!
So, let’s break it down:
The Math
“You can’t put a price on cool.” That’s something someone said in a movie once. It doesn’t matter who or what movie or if I just made it up, because it’s not true. You can put a price on being cool.
For example, if you just want to be double-cool (as in, get two cooling towels) you have to pay $12. That comes down to the totally reasonable per towel price of $6 (especially considering they’re $10 over on Amazon).
Now, here’s where it gets a bit more complicated. As we like to point out on these sales, when figuring out the price per unit of the Hoarder order, it’s not as simple as dividing the overall price ($36) by the number of units (12). BECAUSE, your can choose either 2 or 12, no in-betweens. Therefore, if you think about it, you’re already paying $6 for each of the first 2 towels, which means the last 10 towels are only costing you $24, or a mere $2.40 per towel! How about that deal, huh?!
What you can do with a normal order
It’s pretty simple. Cooling towels are not exactly all that, well, cool, but they are functional. With just two of them, you can use one as your main post-workout cool-down towel, and give the other to your spouse or partner. Or you can cycle through both yourself so you don’t have to do laundry as often.
What can you do with a Hoarder order
So much more! Here are just a few suggestions:


Go a day early and leave a cooling towel at each mile marker of your upcoming 20K race, so you never have to worry about getting too hot.


Take all of them and fashion them into a suit or cocktail dress to wear to outdoor weddings. But would a suit or dress made out of cooling towels really be classy enough for something like that? you might ask. To which we would respond: Could it be any less classy than a suit or dress soaked with sweat?


Sure, you could spend a bunch of money on an air conditioner and then a bunch of more money each month to run it. Or, you could save some cash by sewing yourself a delightful cooling towel quilt!


They’d make a great napkin alternative at your 12-guest “super spicy food banquet”.


Are you a do-gooder teen? Do you often dream of fashioning rope ladders out of clothes and blankets to lower yourself out your 2nd story bedroom window so you can run around after bedtime with your new rebellious friends? Only, your palms get so sweaty that you can’t get a good grip? Gosh, if only you could make a rope ladder out of something cool and soothing to the touch!


See? Maybe we were wrong. Maybe 12 cooling towels isn’t an unreasonable amount of cooling towels at all. On the other hand, you still have the option of buying the (completely boring) 2-pack. The decision is yours!

So again, we have no complaints about this particular karaoke system. Our complaint is about karaoke in general, or, to be more specific, about the musical artists we so often choose NOT to sing. That’s right: I’m talking about birds. Despite being nature’s original songwriters, you rarely hear anyone at a karaoke night sing a song by the many great bird-fronted musical groups out there, such as:

Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a child. Let’s call him @Dave. Dave wore Sears-brand Toughskin jeans. They were, as their name implied, durable and long-lasting. But, like most economically practical things, corners needed to be cut to keep them affordable, and, unfortunately for Dave, the corner Toughskin jeans cut was the let’s-make-these-things-look-cool corner.
Or maybe not unfortunately. Because Dave rarely felt self-conscious in his Toughskin jeans. What did make him feel self-conscious was when, in the mid-80s, his grandparents splurged and got him a Generra sweatshirt. It was “in.” Very “in.” In fact, you could say that it was so deeply “in” that the brand couldn’t find its way out of the decade.
Suddenly, all the other kids at school were stopping Dave in the hallway to say, “Cool sweatshirt,” and, after years of remaining invisible behind the Toughskin curtain, he didn’t know how to react to such a compliment. It was uncomfortable.
Dave has come a long way since then… or has he? No, he doesn’t wear Toughskin jeans anymore, but he still has a Toughskin mindset. He’s not afraid of bright purple laptops or speakers that are loud in both function and design. This, in some ways, is his calling: espousing the virtues of things that don’t look exactly like you’d hope but work just fine.
But he doesn’t exactly know what to do with these slick-looking Rowkin Bluetooth Ear Buds.
Does he say: just because Meh sells some stuff that has substance but lacks style does NOT mean the stylish stuff we sell lacks substance in equal measure? Does he point out that many of the negative reviews on Amazon that have driven the average rating down to an unimpressive 3 stars can be put into 3 categories:

people complaining about the hefty (non-Meh) price tag;
people who struggled with a weird issue that was corrected easily by a factory reset; and
people hating on Bluetooth technology as a whole?

Does he mention that many reviews were impressed with both their size and sound quality (and again, that those people were reviewing after, presumably, paying some 50 bucks more the price they are offered at here)?
No. @Dave does none of these things. He has a copywriter do it, duh."	0.05			2018-09-20T04:00:02.850Z	0.2538143856831479	0.92	72743

As we’ve mentioned before, we recently won an auction for a storage locker that was filled entirely with branded content romance novels. Or so we thought. But, picking through the titles, we actually found many belonged to a branded content epic fantasy series by the author L.L.R. Holdien about a warrior named Tarklaw The Powerful. Luckily for us, there’s a chapter in book 19 about today’s product, the Keysmart (and Keysmart Pro).

Having successfully freed the shape-shifting wizard Vintel, son of Filor The Great, from the floating prison of Delkabana, narrowly escaping the light-spears of the Meschlen Guards by leaping through a portal leading somewhere that only a seer like Wise Crin might intuit–Tarklaw found himself deposited into murky waist-high water.
“Vintel?” Tarklaw called out, trying to locate the wizard whom he had just a moment ago saved, despite their families’ centuries-long acrimonious relations.
“I’m right here, Tarklaw,” Vintel seemed to whisper into his ear, buzzingly. “As a shape-shifting wizard, it is my custom to acclimate my shape to the environs, and so I have taken the form a mosquito because we, bitter-family-enemy-turned-savior, appear to be in a swamp.”
“Not just any swamp! The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors!” came a voice that belonged neither to Tarklaw or Vintel, but another in their vicinity. Tarklaw turned quickly, drawing his great sword with a shing sound common of sword-drawing. But he found only a small creature not unlike an unshelled tortoise, swimming towards them. “Forgive me for startling you! I am Rewn, peaceful leader of the Melorians, the primary inhabitants of this swamp at the edge of the Planet Glor at the far reaches of the Heplan Galaxy. Now, I imagine you’ve come here through some pesky portal or other, but fear not: your exit is easily made through one of the Eight Astounding Doors.”
“Doors?” Said Tarklaw. “I am from the planet Phentalon, a place without doors, due to our peoples’ openness with each other.”
“Very noble,” Rewn said. “Perhaps one day, The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors shall be like that. For now, you must choose one. They go to any number of worlds, from the euphorically beautiful mountain-scape of Relan to the hellish fire-deserts of Dumask. And we have all the keys right here…” Rewn dipped under the water for a moment, but re-emerged with a perplexed look upon his creaturely face. “Oh, dear! They were right there a moment ago.”
“You simply allow all keys to be strewn throughout a swamp?” buzzed Vintel.
“Not exactly,” Rewn said, explanatorily. “We keep them all together using an ingenious contraption known as a KeySmart. Made of aircraft aluminum, it can hold eight keys–or as many as fourteen, with an expansion pack! Additionally, it includes a loop for keys belonging to vehicles propelled by motors. Not to mention, its extended frame can hold long or foreign keys, which is especially important to us, as one of our oldest and most prized keys is made from the hollow bird-like finger bone of the fallen Hilderan Mage Lazlorn.”
“But,” Vintel buzzed, contrarily, “as ingenious and organizationally optimized as that all sounds, it seems at present not to be helping in your ability to locate them.”
“Ah, yes, that would be true if it were the base model, which is still good,” Rewn said. “Luckily for us, we opted for the Pro. Not only does it have a built-in LED flashlight and bottle opener; it can also show a map of your missing keys, and by way of the Tile app–which can be accessed via your smartphone or tablet–you can make your keys ring out loud! Of course, I should add at this juncture that the ‘water’ here in the The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors is different in elemental makeup to that of the water on other planets, such as Earth.”
“Are you saying,” Vintel buzzed, clarifyingly, “that just because we are discussing the KeySmart Pro being used in a water-based situation, it should not be taken as an endorsement of it being waterproof?”
“Exactly,” cried Rewn, disclaimingly.
“Much like doors, smartphones and tablets are concepts foreign to my home world,” Tarklaw said. “But that sounds like a great functional product nonetheless.”
“And I will show you just how functional it is!” Rewn cried with excitement. He brought forward a device and opened the Tile app. A moment later, a ding rang out, though it sounded muffled. The three of them turned… and stood facing a giant glowing snake-like beast. It emerged from the water, standing nearly forty Glorian theltans tall, or forty feet tall in Earth measurements, Glorian theltans being exactly equal to terrestrial feet. The ding sounded again, from somewhere deep inside of the monster’s abdomen.
“Oh no! A Mirelord! Run!” Rewn cried with fear. “Or, better yet, swim.” And with that, he disappeared under the water.
But Tarklaw did not swim away. He crouched into a combat ready position as best he could in the deep murky water. The Mirelord leaned closer to him, its eyes alight with evil.
“What are you doing?” buzzed Vintel into his ear, questioningly.
“We must get out of this swamp,” Tarklaw cried. “This is the only way. Though, it will be hard for just the two of us to defeat it…”
“Perhaps, I can help?” came a distinguished voice from Tarklaw’s side.
Tarklaw turned, and saw… no! He couldn’t believe it! “Hinton, son of Raquille, wielder of The Great Axe Of Orlagos, and best friend since birth of Tarklaw The Powerful? But I thought you were–”
“The immortal prisoner of the Inter-dimensional Pirate Lop, locked away in the his ship, The Pummeling Ewlok, for all of eternity?” Hinton laughed. “Not a chance in Dumask, my friend! Now, what do you say we free the aforementioned product from the belly of the beast? Just like old times?”
Tarklaw couldn’t help but smile. “Just like old times, indeed,” he said, and they raised their weapons to the approaching Mirelord."	0.05			2018-09-19T04:00:10.856Z	0.34612555704581827	0.93	72268

One time, I left without remembering to close the door.
I was living in a house somewhere so rural we didn’t need to lock up, and, in a rush to leave (I was going on a trip), I forgot to swing the door all the way closed, leaving only the screen door between my cat and freedom. He was fine. My mom checked on him the next day and, much to her surprise, he emerged from under the deck after spending what must’ve been, for an indoor cat, a terrifying night outside.
Just about every time I have left the house since then, even if just for an hour, I have wondered: “did I close the door? Did I lock the door? Do the pets have food? Do they have water? Did I leave the oven on? Did I unconsciously light seven candles and place them precariously close to window curtains that are, unbeknownst to me, highly flammable?” Many times, I have gone back to check. Never have I left the stove on. Never have I found candles flickering. The pets have always been fine. Only once or twice have I found the door unlocked.
Still, I never regret it, because it’s nicer to know everything’s fine than it is to hope everything’s fine.
And that’s really what these Zmodo MeShare cameras are for: making sure. You can call them “security cameras,” but that feels a little overstated. Maybe it would be better to rebrand them as “check-in cameras.” After all, the chances that you’re going to tune in as your home is being burglarized–thus allowing you to call the authorities while the burglary is in progress–is very low. I mean, hell, the actual likeliness of your home being burglarized at all is very low. And if your first thought upon reading that is, Nuh-uh, my home gets broken into all the time, we won’t argue with you. But we will say: you probably need more than a couple Zmodos.
Otherwise, these are a good option for the second-guessers out there to quell all the concerns that might flare up during your day at work: whether you just want to make sure everything’s fine, or to check that you didn’t forget to close the windows, or to monitor whether your dog is feeling okay after eating something stupid that he wasn’t supposed to…

So, the first thing you need to know is that these are little. They’re for kids or pets, not full-sized adults. So if you’re looking for sectional solution for game day with your buddies: this is no good… unless you’re, like, 10 and so are all your buddies (in which case, make sure you ask your parents before you buy this thing, okay? See! We’re responsible!)
The second thing you need to know is that the backs velcro on, and the seats have magnets in them, which makes them “infinitely configurable.” And yet, if that’s the case, then why is are these proposed layouts so BORING?! They’re mostly just couches. Where’s the fun in that? Why not try something more exciting, like these three designs:
You’re Number One

Will anyone even see that it’s a #1? Probably not. Is it really a practical way to lay out a room? No. But the subliminal reassurance that the design will provide for your child is massive. Every time they sit down they’ll think, “Hey, you know what: I’m special!” And this confidence will push them to do great things.
Game Room

Checkers is simple and boring on a board… but what about in a room, with you and all of your friends as the pieces? To make it more exciting: institute a rule where it’s not as easy as just “jumping” another piece; instead, you have to battle for it. Whoever doesn’t get cast into one of the empty spaces (i.e. onto the floor) wins!
Soft Kitchen

Okay, this isn’t exactly innovative, design-wise. But in terms of utility? Think about it: you cover the floor of your kitchen, wall-to-wall, with Sactionals, and now, suddenly, you can drop a glass or a ceramic mug and it won’t shatter! Plus, they’re machine washable, in case there’s a spill. Best of all, if you need to keep an eye on something you’ve got baking, you can just lay down next to the oven and watch it!

A cheers to vacation (which is defined as a trip that occurs when someone, delirious from the heat, begins to think, you know what I bet would be great?

Dear @reclaimercube,
On September 2nd, you posted the following comment on a knife sale:

Meh I have anxiously been awaiting for you to post a toothbrush for sale again. I will post this everyday until you finally sell another one again.

And, @reclaimercube, can we tell you something? We’re very proud of you. Because you kept your word. Since then, each day, you’ve put forward this same request.
Your fellow Meh customers began to notice. One post from Friday, September 7th sparked a discussion that involved more than 20 comments. In that conversation, someone pointed out a toothbrush for sale on a competitor’s site. You, ever strong, refused to take the bait:

not a bad deal… But not on meh so it doesn’t matter. You could link me to colgate’s website or crest’s website for a free toothbrush and I still wouldn’t want it unless it was on meh. I’m chaining myself to this statue. Ride or die mehbrother.

Your repeated request did not specify why you wanted a toothbrush, or what kind of toothbrush you wanted. Really, you haven’t even promised that you’d buy the toothbrush. You’ve only asked, repeatedly, for us to “post a toothbrush.”
Well, good news, @reclaimercube: when we launched Meh, we made a decision. Once, and only once, we would allow a Meh customer to dictate exactly what we’d sell. The only rule was they had to make the request for 13 consecutive days. They could ask for $1 MacBooks, or free puppies, or Cadillac Escalades filled with cash. It didn’t matter. There were no restrictions, aside from the 13 days. Some of us worried the financial hit would be too much, but others felt assured: we could trust our customers! They wouldn’t make unreasonable demands!
So thank you, @reclaimercube; you’ve shown us that our faith was not misplaced. Now, Meh community, let’s all come together and celebrate with this build-your-own-bundle of toothbrushes.
Sincerely,
Meh

Hair: it is the ultimate example of disobedience.
You can train puppies to pee outside, to walk next to you, to sit, to shake, to do any number of fun and/or useful things. With cats, the job is much harder, but with some persistence (and a spray bottle) it is possible to enforce a few rules: you do not yowl in the middle of the night, you do not walk on the kitchen counter, you do not knock our decorative trinkets off the mantle as a game. Even a bonsai can be coaxed, over time, to grow a certain way.
But not hair. Nope, no matter how many times you comb, shave, style, epilate, and wax: it can just never take the fucking hint!
You know that person in your  your life who’s like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “hmm, maybe?” And you hope they’ll just drop it, but then a day later, they’re like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “I don’t know if that dumb thing is really a good idea.” Which should be clear as hell, but they don’t want to listen, so they keep prodding and prodding until you’re like, “Look,  I don’t want to do the dumb thing because it is dumb, and honestly, I’m worried you might be dumb for suggesting it, and I might be dumb for being the friend of such a dumb person.” And you feel terrible but they just smile and say, “C’mon! It’ll be great!”
That’s hair. No matter how many times you try to send the message that you don’t want it to come back there, it keeps coming back there. It is untrainable!
Or is that the wrong way to look at it? Could it be that we are the untrainable ones? That our hair is not being a stubborn learner but a tenacious teacher? That it wants to lead us to a better place? A place where we eschew the standards of beauty thrust upon us? Because isn’t it pretty arbitrary where we say there should be hair and where we say there should not? On the head is good, but not on the face? Except some faces capable of growing thick enough hair? On the chest is okay, but no, never on the back? Not on the legs, but okay on the arms, except in the armpits? Could it be that our hair’s persistence is its way of saying: you need to get the hell over it and just be who you are?

The three brothers had been cleaning out their grandfather’s basement for nearly two hours before they found the FoodSaver.
“What’s this?” said Kyle, holding it up.
“Looks old,” said Jake. “I’d guess circa second half of the 2010’s.”
Terry took it from Kyle and inspected it. “Wait, I know these things. It’s an early model weed-sealer. You know? The devices for vacuum-packing weed so it wouldn’t go bad.”
“All this talk of weed remind me, have you guys taken your three o’clock edibles yet?” Jake asked.
Kyle and Terry nodded.
“But wait,” Kyle said, “why does it say FoodSaver on it, if it’s for weed?”
“You have to understand, Kyle, this was before weed was legal everywhere,” Terry explained. “They didn’t even put it in the water back then!”
Kyle looked at the FoodSaver perplexed. “Really?”
“I’m serious,” Terry said. “So people weren’t as acclimated to it as we are now. They considered it a drug. Thus, when people took some, they got ‘high,’ which basically meant they thought without logic. So it’s likely that the inventor of the ‘FoodSaver’ only named it such because he was super high, and probably pretty hungry.”
“So strange to think that the same substance that keeps us calm and measured, used to have almost the opposite effect!” Kyle said.
Now Jake had the FoodSaver. “Are you sure this is a weed-sealer? To me, it looks like an early sous-vide-assistant. That would make more sense with the FoodSaver name.”
“Did they even sous vide back then?” Terry asked.
“Sure,” Jake said. “It was more of a luxury, though, given that it was before the Microwave And Oven Act of 2035.”
“When I read about those times, and all the negative-energy-pollution caused by those now illegal kitchen appliances, it just makes me sick,” Terry said.
“Guys, you’ve got me thinking…” Kyle paused to gather his thoughts. “Well, you know how when we put stuff in the freezer, it just freezes together and gets covered in weird ice?”
“They’re called water diamonds, Kyle,” Terry said.
“They mean the moisture has accepted the food, so we know it’s safe to eat,” Jake said.
“I’m well aware of them and what they mean. Don’t forget, I’m the one who studied health at Dove For Men Presents: College. But I was thinking, the food doesn’t always taste good after the water diamonds form.” Kyle took the FoodSaver from Jake. “And I know this is going to sound crazy, but if this thing could keep weed fresh, and be used with food products for sous-vide purposes, maybe we could combine the two functions. Like, we could use it to seal food before we freeze it so it stays fresher longer.”
“You mean, you want to eat food that’s been frozen but hasn’t emitted its proper water diamonds?” Terry said.
“Isn’t that illegal?” Jake added.
“Sure, on Earth. But not here,” Kyle said, “on Mars.”
Jake and Terry had to admit he had a point: they definitely had been on Mars this whole time."	0.05			2018-09-13T04:00:05.184Z	0.21097046413502127	0.92	62121

As someone who doesn’t brush his hair much, Wet Brushes look, to me, like normal brushes. But looks can be deceiving. Or, in this case, the looks are deceivingly simple. In truth, everything I’ve read about them states, quite simply, that they’re best brushes around. And today, we’re selling a pack of three: one pro, one pop fold, and one paddle.
They’re all designed specifically to brush out tangles without pain or tugging. They work especially well on wet hair, but can be used on dry hair too, even wigs and extensions. The paddle features “AquaVents” that help with ventilation and drying as you brush. In short, they sound great. But again, I don’t brush my hair really ever, so if you don’t want to take my word for it–or the word of the many happy customers over on Amazon–then maybe these totally real reviews from absolutely not-made-up hair professionals will help seal the deal:

The Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet is pretty simple: it’s a wallet that comes with a powerpack, which can be used to charge your phone or other devices.
In a way, to recharge something is to refill it, but unfortunately, while the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet does fill your wallet in the literal sense–like, there is a powerpack inside of it–it can’t refill your wallet in the figurative sense–as in, recharge your bank account.
Or can it?
Because think about this: what kind of phone is the most likely to have a short battery life? An old phone! And maybe you have an upgrade waiting for you, but you don’t want to dish out the money for one. Because maybe, with your provider, it’s not as simple as handing over $200 and getting a new iPhone. Now, you pay for the upgrade via a small increase in your monthly bill–a small increase that over time accumulates into a lot of money. And it’s very possible that this change was made because people like you: people who buy a phone and then ride it into the ground, thus spending a couple hundred bucks every six years, rather than evert two like your cell company–let’s call them Werizon–would prefer.
And so now you’ve got a geriatric phone that needs a pick-me-up every few hours to make it through the day, and you’re not always near an outlet, so one of these Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallets–‘wallets’ plural because you get a 2-pack–is just what you need. It’s your wallet, so it’s not like you’ll forget it. Thus, you’ll always have some charge on hand, which means you don’t need to upgrade, which means your phone bill won’t go up, which means you’ll save money, which, in conclusion, means the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet can, in fact, recharge both your phone and your wallet!

I remember being a kid, riding in my parents’ car at night, and dropping something. Maybe a toy or a quarter. It doesn’t matter what. What matters is I reached up and turned on the dome light to find the object in question. And it was then that my dad freaked the fuck out. You would’ve thought I’d tossed hot acid in his eyes. “Turn that off! I can’t see anything!” he claimed. He might’ve even swerved a little, for emphasis. As a dutiful child, I switched the light off as quickly as possible to avoid careening off the road into a ditch.
Flash forward some years: I have a license. I have a car. A friend is riding with me. He turns on the dome light for something and… everything is fine.
The same thing happened the first time I helped jumpstart a car. I’d been told so many times about everything that can go terribly wrong that I felt sure that it would end in a) an deadly storm of electricity and fire; or b) one or both of the cars being fried for good. Turns out, if you, ya know, just follow instructions, it works out fine.
If anything, the greatest risk of jumping a car–the one that no amount of how-to articles or Youtube videos can save you from–is the risk of wasting a favor. Because think about it: you spend all that time being a good friend and building up positive equity until you’ve almost got enough to cash in for pet care or help shlepping some furniture from your old apartment to your new one… Then your car battery farts out and now your buddy is driving over in the cold to help you get it started again.
That’s where this iJoy Jump Starter Kit comes in. Not only will it charge your phone and provide some you with some light; it’ll make it so that you don’t need to dip into the favor bank just to get your car running.

Another super villain attacking the city, another mad rush downtown. We newspaper photographers are the real heroes, Roy thought to himself with a chuckle as he ran from the Gazette office into the mayhem, clutching his camera to his chest.
It was a joke, of course. Roy didn’t think he was more heroic than the Scarlet Savior. But he could relate to her in one way: like her, he never had any help. After layoffs there were just two of them in the photography department; they outsourced the rest. And it just so happened that whenever disaster struck, Lorraine was rushing off to take care of “a personal issue.”
What a coincidence, Roy thought. Always trying to get out of work! Then something else occurred to him: was it possible that Lorraine was, in fact, the alter ego of–
A taxi honked at Roy as he sprinted across the street toward the sounds of lasers and maniacal laughter a few blocks away. “Watch where you’re going buddy!” the diver yelled.
“I’m working!” Roy yelled back.
“Yeah, yeah,” the driver said. “Well, we’re all working too. Working on staying alive in this damn city!”
Roy laughed. Not at the man but at the theory the honk had charitably eradicated from his mind. Lorraine couldn’t be the Scarlet Savior. Sure, they both had striking red hair, but the Scarlet Savior always wore a matching Treasure Island jewelry set–one necklace, one bracelet, both made out of genuine gemstones and pearls–whereas Lorraine wore a single longer Treasure Island necklace, which was also made of genuine gemstones and pearls.
Well, that settles that! Roy thought. And just in time too! Because here she came, the Scarlet Savior, flying through the sky, blazing a red path through the sky that, strangely, looked like it originated on the roof of the Gazette’s offices.

We sold these just a couple months ago, but it seems like we were so young then. We thought: are people really going to pay five more dollars for a little bit more unzippability? We even exaggerated the difference in the write-up as a joke, thinking: sure, some are going to want that extra accessibility, but a lot of people are just looking for something functional for as cheap as possible.
We were so arrogant, so naive.
The actual sales breakdown helped us see the light:

So, this time, we’re trying something a little different. We’re dropping the price of both but not by the same amount: for the one with multiple zippers, the price will be just a buck lower, whereas, the single-zipper version will be a whopping $5 less than last time. For those keeping score at home: that’s now a $9 difference between the two.
In some ways, this isn’t simply a sale; it’s an experiment. We want to answer the question: what is a zipper truly worth?

There are three potential outcomes to buying this Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk:
Outcome 1
You buy the standing desk. You’re intrigued by its promises of a stronger core, healthier circulation, improved productivity, and better posture. But the truth is, you don’t care for it. You’ve spent your entire life believing that getting work done requires sitting down and shutting up. So how do you expect, as an adult, to change your working position? Maybe if you gave it more time… but you don’t want to. You just want to use it as a normal desk. And that’s fine! Because this thing didn’t cost north of $600 like some models out there; it cost less than $200. And look, that’s not nothing, but it was a worthwhile gamble.
Outcome 2
You love your new standing desk. But it’s not enough. Once you taste the thrill of working upright, you want more. You quickly replace your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk with a treadmill desk. You start out walking, but soon enough you’re outright sprinting while you manage your spreadsheets and respond to emails. You get a kiddy pool and set it up behind the treadmill, filling it with a medley of pirañas and water moccasins. Now, any slowdown and you’re in trouble. But even that’s not enough. You take out the water moccasins, extract their venom, and put it in an IV that runs directly into your arm. The anti-venom is in another IV that you’ve rigged to only administer as you meet your hourly sales goals. Your friends and family members are worried about you, but you’ve never felt more alive! And it all started with the Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk!
Outcome 3
You get your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk, and you like it. You crank it up to standing height for a few hours of the day; for the rest of the time, you use it as a normal desk. You’re neither disappointed, nor unsatisfied. It meets your needs, and you will use it for the foreseeable future.

Shaving is the blandest and yet most grueling task of every personal grooming regimen. It is a zero sum game: you can put it off, but that only means it’ll be a longer and more grueling process when eventually you do get around to it. It’s like mowing the lawn, except without the exercise, and the smell of fresh cut grass replaced by the noxious chemical odor of shave gel. In short, it’s miserable.
Or it was. Until now. Enter these “Famous Maker” razors. Famous Maker? you say. But who IS the famous maker? That’s just the thing, we can’t tell you. And now suddenly, shaving is an act of immeasurable mystery and excitement!
Could it be that these razors are the excess produced by an underground razor factory located far below Park City? Perhaps for the original purpose of being distributed, in secret, to the agents and publicists and personal assistants of actors in town for the Sundance Film Festival? So that these various agents and publicists and assistants could sneak into the actors’ hotel rooms at night and shave their faces clean while they slept? Because maybe the actors, having escaped the always-on environs of Los Angeles, wanted to let themselves go, but the various men and women whose livelihoods relied on their pristine image had other things in mind?
Or could it be that the razors are from a different hidden factory, a facility built into the side of one of the Alps? For a baron? A baron who volunteered to host the worldwide beard and mustache contest at his expansive villa? While harboring a secret hatred of all facial hair? And so the plan was not to celebrate these growers of elaborate beards and mustaches, but to trap them and then use the razors to, as the baron said in a private correspondence, “reveal their cheeks upper lips once again to the world”? Maybe he even wanted to shave the hair on their head too, just to prove a point? Only his scheme was discovered by the lowly helper-boy tasked with taking his correspondence to the post office? And so the baron had no choice but to sell off his stock of razors in an effort to cut (pun intended) his losses?
Or could it be a pretty basic story of a razor company having some leftover razors that they wanted to offload? Only they couldn’t do so under their own name? Because then people would be like, “but wait, I just spent this much on these at the store, but now you’re selling them for cheap online? That’s bullshit!”?
Okay, for purposes of whimsy, let’s just ignore that last scenario. Instead, focus on the first two, buy these razors, and shave with an entirely new sense of intrigue!"	0.05			2018-09-05T04:00:15.298Z	0.26119278036366067	0.93	62903

Or so I thought…
Then I went to do some research on Amazon and saw a question about what material was used to make the pivot washers and how thick the blade is. The first answer reads as follows:

Sorry, this was a gift for someone in Arizona so I can’t answer your question. I can only say that the knife is substantial!

So, how thick is the blade?
Great question! I’d guess that it’s probably about the same as other knives like it, although it could be thicker. But even then, it wouldn’t be too much thicker, because that would be weird, right?
I’m reading that it has a “stonewashed drop-point blade.” That sounds intense. What kind of stuff can you use it for?
I bet it would be pretty good at cutting through most stuff you’d use a knife like this for, but I don’t feel comfortable naming specific stuff because I’ve never used one. I will say this, though: there’s a good chance it can cut through butter. And an even better chance if the butter has been left out of the fridge for a little while.
Was it designed by Bill Harsey?
Sure was! As to who Bill Haresay is, lol, idk! I would venture to guess he does something in the knife industry.
One reviewer says that it is 11.8"" long when it’s extended. Is that longer than other knives?
Not sure. It is definitely not as long as a foot, because a foot is 12"". With that being said, another reviewer posted a photo of it next to another knife and a tape measurer, if that helps. It is bigger than the other knife, but not the tape measurer (which is good, because those things can get really long).
Wow! This is so easy! It’s great to finally realize how much a knife expert I really am! Thanks Amazon question answerer, for showing me the way.

This Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble may seem simple enough. It’s 6 100% ceramic products with matching designs: a toothbrush holder, a tumbler, a soap dish, a lotion dispenser, a tissue box, and a trash bin. None of these things require much explanation. What does deserve some attention, though, is the multi-stage process that one goes through when deciding to buy one or all of them. We’ve laid it out below:
Stage 1: Intrigue
These are interesting. The various pieces look stylish, and they all match. It might be nice to have a motif that really brings the entire bathroom together.
Stage 2: Skepticism
But do I really need any of these? The old coffee mug we put the toothbrushes in works just fine, as does the little wicker basket we’ve got for trash. The sink already has a built-in soap dish. This one would be easier to clean, but do you really need to clean something when all it does is hold soap? Isn’t soap itself essentially the concept of cleanliness made solid? Lotion bottles already come with a pump top and tissue boxes are their own tissue dispensers, really. Am I supposed to re-package things? Isn’t that adding unnecessary steps?
Stage 3: Re-evaluation
Yes, I guess technically it is adding unnecessary steps, but all in the service of style. And maybe that’s worth it. Which would maybe mean the steps aren’t unnecessary?
*Stage 4: Introspection
And what does it say about me that I’m so put off by these objectively simple tasks? Like, it isn’t hard to empty some lotion from one thing into another thing. It isn’t hard to put a box of tissues inside another box. Or clean a soap dish. Just like it isn’t hard to put a new bag in the garbage after I take the trash out. But I never do, not right away at least. I always wait hours, sometimes even a whole day, leaving paper towels and granola bar wrappers on the kitchen counter, until finally my desire for a clean surface outweighs my laziness. At which point I put a new bag in the garbage can and am reminded that the laziness was all to avoid something that takes mere seconds. And yet, when next I need to take out the trash, this process will repeat. Making matters worse: someday it might not just be taking out the trash. Someday it might be dirty diapers I’m dealing with. It might be taking kids to the doctor. It might taking the medication I need to stay alive. And when that time comes will I just attempt to put it off? I want to say no, that I’ll be past all of this by then, that I’ll finally be a responsible organized adult… but an I’m adult now, damnit! I should already be better than this!
Stage 5: Ascension
That’s it! No more! I’m going to buy every item in this Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble, not just because it’s stylish and will tie my bathroom together nicely! No, that’s all secondary. Really, I’m doing it to prove to everyone–but especially myself–that I’m capable of taking the right steps and building good habits! New me, here we come!
Stage 6: Regression
Purchase made! Now, it’s time for bed. Shit, wait? It’s trash day tomorrow, isn’t it? I should take the bin to the curb. Although, there really are only a couple bags in there. I’m sure I’d be fine until next week…"	0.07			2018-09-01T04:00:01.758Z	0.3734081588603498	0.94	49783

There’s an old saying about innovation: “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.” It is derived from an Emerson quote that reads: “If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.” In this way, the saying is an example of itself; the ‘mousetrap’ variant is shorter, snappier, and conveys the exact same meaning, thus it is the one most often used.
The implication here is basically if you build it, they will come: you’ll have lines around the block, people from all over frantically waving their bills in the air demanding the latest in mouse-entrapment technology.
The truth, we know now, is a bit different.
The world, upon beating a path to your door, would say, “This mousetrap is smaller and more humane than the previous mousetrap, but now I’ve decided I want a mousetrap that is smaller and more humane.” Or, “I have no mice in my house, but many spiders, and this mousetrap did not catch a single spider, which is a bit of a disappointment.” Or, “Excuse me, I have some ideas for how you might make this better mousetrap–which is a good start–into an even greater mousetrap, despite the fact that I have never myself built any mousetrap.”
And so it goes with the Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Pack. You can put it in the microwave if you need heat, or you can put in the freezer if you want it to be cold. The ceramic beads heat and cool with the gel, providing a nice texture, which one Amazon reviewer says, “makes for an easy massage.” But the title of that review–“slightly different than the norm”–is telling. It implies that the incorporation of a heretofore never used component is something slight. Innovation, people seem to believe, requires a total redo.
Yes, some reviews expressed issues with durability. That’s understandable to call out. A few wished it would be more pliable when frozen. Again, fair.
But then there are the other “complaints.”
One says: “The only drawback I’ve seen so far to this item is its size. For the most part, I don’t think the size will be an issue because it’s probably rare to treat an area larger than 6x10”.""
Just so we’re clear: the only issue this reviewer could foresee would arise in a scenario that they couldn’t foresee arising.
Another–in a review titled “Does the job but not much better than competition”–claims: “the problem is just like every other reusable gel back I’ve ever used: they simply don’t remain truly hot or cold enough for long enough to do a good job. They’re more warm or cool than they are hot or cold for much longer.”
To put it differently: the biggest problem with this product, in this reviewer’s experience, is endemic to this entire product category, not just this product, and relies upon a universal tolerance of hot and cold temperatures.
The point of all this is to show that people will always find things to gripe about. And maybe they’re right. Still, it seems like the best case scenario is that you really love the texture of the ceramic beads inside the gel, and the worst case scenario is that you get three of totally passable hot/cold packs for $18.

Here we go again! The return of The Skeptics Choice, our occasional write-up segment wherein we read what a product claims to do and say, “hmm… I don’t know…” Today, we’re talking about a PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser. Follow along, won’t you?
The Claim
For all those who are thinking that we’ve been through this all before, fear not: this is a different kind of diffuser than the one we sold last time. This one is a “one-of-a-kind product combines the therapeutic properties of a pure Himalayan salt rock lamp with the soothing aromatherapy of an essential oil diffuser.” Apparently, it sets “the perfect mood for relaxation at home” and provides “all the benefits you would expect from this powerful combo.”
The Skepticism
That last part is a little presumptuous. All the benefits I would expect? I understand each word in the phrase “Himalayan Salt Lamp” on its own, but I know nothing about what they mean when they’re put together. But that’s no bother! It’s all laid out right there in the marketing copy:


The first benefit is that it will “help boost your mood.” And honestly, that sounds legit! When you’ve had your windows shut for almost 12 consecutive months because it took just a single day for the seasons transition from the bitter cold of winter to the brutal humidity of summer, something that makes the air smell pretty can be a nice little pick-me-up.


The second benefit is that it can “increase energy levels.” This seems a little more like bullshit than the first claim, but it’s vague enough that I’m willing to give it a pass.


The third benefit is that it will “neutralize the positively charged ions that emit from electronic devices like smartphones, televisions, radios, and more.”


Umm, what the fuck? That sure escalated quickly.
Seriously, the difference in hysteria levels from “it might boost your mood” to “it’ll protect you from killer ions” is about equal to the difference between a “hang in there, kitty” poster and one of those spam posts from MySpace that was like, “Post this on 10 of your friends’ profiles or else your eyes will fall out.”
And by the way, I’m not against a lot of this stuff. Crystals are fine. Astrology is fine. You could argue that it’s unscientific, but that’s missing the point. Life sucks sometimes. If getting some stones to put in your pocket makes you feel less like you’re flying a cloud of chaos towards an inevitably disappointing conclusion, more power to you! I watch groups of men in polyester play what is basically an IRL-board game involving sticks and balls on an enormous grass-and-dirt field, and if the group of men I like outplays the group of men I don’t like, I feel profound happiness. So, I try not to judge people for the things they use to pass the time.
But I will ABSOLUTELY judge anyone who preys upon someone based on those things. Because that’s what they’re doing here. They’re not saying: “you like this thing? we make this thing~” They’re saying, “we make this thing! it is DANGEROUS not to have this thing!!!” In other words, it’s taking something that should be a distraction from the chaos of daily life–which it totally could be, by the way: it’s cool looking; it lights up; it smells nice–and turning it into part of the chaos of daily life. And that’s messed up.
(Also, sorta tangential but still relevant, it’s problematic in a whole other way: What’s dangerous about technology is not that it’s pumping the air full of ions; it’s how intrusive it is. For example, did you know that if you say “Bloody Mary” three times into your smart phone, an ad for “great local brunch spots” will appear on your Facebook timeline? Our devices are definitely listening to us. We can all agree on that, right? Fine, maybe I’m just being paranoid. But you have to know that every Google search, every purchase, every photo you post is being mined for important data. And so making it a conversation about “ions” is pushing it in a direction that helps no one but those selling PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffusers.)
The Conclusion
If you want a thing that lights up and looks cool and smells nice, this is a good investment. If you’re thinking about buying this because you’re afraid to breath in all the electro-turds you released into the air while binging Sharp Objects, maybe open a window?"	0.05			2018-08-30T04:00:02.770Z	0.20794343938448737	0.93	60935

1.

I’m a lawyer, but right now, I’m not in the courtroom. Instead, it’s late at night and I’m in my office, wearing Ray-Ban glasses, poring over all the evidence of this grueling case, trying to find something to prove my client is innocent. All the older lawyers at this firm didn’t want to take my client on, and I’m starting to see why, but then again, I’m a young perky go-getter. Sometimes I worry that I’m too concerned with upholding justice, that I get too wrapped up in what’s right and wrong, that I fall in love with too many of my clients. But I can’t think about that now. I need to squint through my Ray-Bans at this piece of paper, then dig out another piece of paper and squint at that one, before realizing I’ve found it: a small but pretty obvious detail that proves my client wasn’t there that night. Thanks, Ray-Bans! I couldn’t have done it without you.

2.

I’m a bit of a nerd. You can tell because I’m always wearing these thick Ray-Ban frames. Also, I’m always doing nerdy things like taking notes in class or carrying a lot of books. Sometimes I drop them, to the delight of cheerleaders and jocks. My best friend is quirky and outgoing, but I am not. I have a figure that would require a nutritionist and hours of gym time each day to maintain, but you can’t see it under these bulky sweaters that I wear, while sitting in my bedroom listening to non-aggressive indie rock or reading an obscure book like Wuthering Heights or The Collected Plays of William Shakespeare. Perhaps someday, someone will move here from out of town and crack this high school’s social hierarchy wide open, but until then it’s just me, my one quirky friend, my books, my sweaters, and my Ray-Ban glasses.

3.

I’m what you might call a savant. I’m always doing things like solving unsolvable math equations, or going to the park and playing five games of chess at a time… and winning. The crisp lines of my Ray-Ban frames are definitely in stark contrast with my wildly disheveled hair! Can I tell you something? I wasn’t surprised to see the government suits show up at my house. What did surprise me was when they took me to the research facility and showed me what they found. I stared at it for a whole a minute. Then I dramatically took off my Ray-Ban glasses, wiped them on my shirt, and stared at it for a minute longer. I didn’t know what I was looking at. What I did know was that, despite being just a guy from Queens (with the IQ of a Nobel laureate), I might save the world. Strap in, Ray-Bans! This is going to be a long ride!

Apparently, our minds cannot be trusted, and for that we are sorry.

Hmmm…
How do we say it exactly?
Let’s try this: we thought you were implying that the M Cushion could be applied to places where the combination of friction and heat might bring about sensations not unrelated to relief, but a step beyond relief, a sort of deep relief that goes by many names, one of which it shares with a term from film and literature meaning the culmination of the story’s drama.
But, um… apparently we were a little off-base. As one quoted commenter noted:

I swear I didn’t mean it in a sexual way. I just meant after leg day you can lean back in bed and use it on your aching thighs rather comfortably.

So, we apologize to you, commenters who we misunderstood. And moreover, we apologize also to all out there who purchased the M Cushion hoping for that aforementioned special sense of relief and, instead, received what seems to be a pretty good, if not aggressive, massage pillow and little else.
Thus, we promise not to make the same mistake again.

Time to dive into our library of branded content romance novels, for a tale of secrecy, royalty, and grilling. Please enjoy these excerpts from Coals Aflame by Criminy Highlater.

Grilling with one tool? Mary had gotten used to that thanks to her Starfrit Tonglite. In many ways, she was a lot like the 6-in-1 bbq multi-tool: she was strong, she had many skills, could do many things, and, since Eric had run off with his secretary a year before, she relied only on herself.
Which was what she planned to do that Saturday afternoon. Her work at the non-profit, helping troubled youth gain acceptance to Ivy League schools, didn’t leave her much time for making friends, so she would do it on her own. She would take a cooler, her little grill, and her Starfrit, and she would go from her apartment in Soho to Central Park to have a little cookout for one. It would be simple… or so she thought.
“M’lady, if I may have a word,” came a voice soon after she’d set up. Mary ignored it, thinking it sounded so British and refined that it must be coming from someone’s radio. But when it persisted, she looked up.
An austere and very handsome man stood in front of her.
“There you are,” he said. “I couldn’t help but gain sight of your grill, and I wondered if I might bequeath you of a favor?”
Mary had gotten good at doing things alone since Eric left, but there was something interesting about this man, something that made her desire his company.

The man said his name was Collin, and he worked for the a mysterious member of the royal family, Prince Nigel. Mary remembered seeing on the news that Nigel was making his first visit to the United States. She hadn’t listened to the story, because she’d been distracted by the strange mask the prince seemed to wear everywhere.
“What kind of work do you do for him?” Mary asked.
“All sorts,” was all Collin said.
“And so what can I help you with?” Mary asked.
“Well, being among the prince’s central envoy, I am privy to many of the finest restaurants in the world, but I don’t always want to partake in such luxury. And I was hoping you might allow me to dine with you, to take in a true American meal!”
“That’s it?” Mary asked. “You want a burger and some hot dogs?”
“'Tis my heart’s desire,” Collin said with a winning smile. “And if it would please you, I’d be happy to help. For example, perhaps I will unpack the remainder of the tools you require for grilling?”
Mary smiled and held up the Starfrit. “I only need one!”

Mary flipped burgers with the spatula when the upper arm was drawn back and rotated hot dogs with the tongs when the upper arm was extended. She opened them each a bottle of beer with the opener. “A fine colonial ale!” Collin said. Mary laughed, using the Starfrit’s serrated edge to cut the buns.
While they ate, Mary asked, “So is Prince Nigel really as eccentric as he seems?”
“You’re asking about the mask, I presume?”
Mary blushed. ""Well, I–
Collin laughed. “It’s no issue. It’s what everyone wants to know: why is he always wearing that strange masquerade mask, the one behind which he has hidden since his youth? Is his face disfigured? Is he some sort of lunatic? But the truth is, he simply desires privacy. He doesn’t want to be followed everywhere he goes.”
Mary opened her mouth, ready to say that this made sense–that she could not imagine what it must be like–when suddenly the sky went dark.
Nearby people screamed. Collin grabbed her hand, fearfully. “My god, it’s some sort of unpredicted total solar eclipse! Not even my royal astronomer saw this coming!”
Mary switched on the Starfrit’s flashlight, which she usually only used for convenient nighttime cooking.
“What do you mean ‘your’ royal astronomer?” She asked. She pointed the flashlight towards him, then towards his arm, and down to wear his hand still held hers. She felt a rush of something she had not felt in some time, not since Eric.
But then, the sun came back. Mary turned the light off and set the Starfrit down. Collin quickly stood. “I’ve just realized something, something very important,” he said. “Blast, I have so much bloody work. I must be retreating, but perhaps we could meet later? For another ale?”
Mary nodded. Collin named a bar–a dingy sports bar on the East Side–and a time. With that, he was gone. When Mary went to pack up, she couldn’t find her Starfrit anywhere. Which was a shame, as its scraper feature certainly would’ve helped her to clean her grill.

Mary waited at the bar, nursing her beer. The televisions were all turned to the baseball game, with the sound way up. Occasionally, a promo for the evening news promised coverage of Prince Nigel’s visit as well as the strange lunar happening of the afternoon.
“Who cares,” Mary mumbled to herself. Collin was late. Of course he was! He probably wasn’t coming. Another near-miss with love, she thought.
Just then, the feed cut out from the baseball game. “We interrupt this broadcast to bring you, a statement from Prince Nigel the Third.”
There he stood, the man in the strange mask. Mary laughed. He looked so silly. Then he spoke.
“Good morrow, our friends from across the pond,” he said.
Mary felt herself go rigid. She recognized that voice! But no, it couldn’t be. Could it?
“Collin?” she said, as if he could answer her through the television.
“It has been lovely visiting your many museums and areas of historical importance,” the prince went on. “But it was none of them that taught me the most. It was a single person–a single woman–who showed me the true American character, one that is not afraid of multiplicity.” He held up the Starfrit; Mary’s breath caught. “I’ve learned that, like this tool, Americans can do great things, many different great things, and are not as easily categorizable as they seem. And like this tool, they can do wonders at a grill.”
The crowd broke out in laughter in applause. Cameras flashed.
“Now, I may have more to say on this later. But right now, I must be going. I need to return this to its rightful owner. I fear I may even be late!” Just as quickly as the address had begun, it was over. The baseball game returned.
“Anyone sitting here?” a woman said to Mary, indicating the seat next to her at a bar.
Mary smiled. “Yes,” she said. “Or I should say, he’s on his way here now.”"	0.07			2018-08-25T04:00:01.567Z	0.3806925754768836	0.9	53347	0.020357891736731745

But this image is a fantasy. You can’t actually manage cooking four precise things at once. Honestly, if your stove had only one or two burners, it would work just fine. It might free up some counter space for dealing with the onions you forgot to mince until after your butter had already melted (and burned) in the frying pan.
Thus, purchasing four pots and pans all at once is not necessary, but it is aspirational. You need to keep the dream alive, of wowing your friends and family members with perfectly balanced 4-part meals that make use of descriptors like “deconstructed” or “molecular” or “done three ways.” To have only one pan or one pot would be to admit defeat, to shut the door on your glorious dreams.
In the meantime, great news: you can make your signature “pasta a la butter and a handful of shredded cheese” in one of these just fine! And if you want to make the same thing tomorrow, even more great news: you don’t even need to do the dishes because you’ve got three other cooking vessels just waiting for a turn!"	0.05			2018-08-24T04:00:01.907Z	0.23620242900706845	0.93	59918

In school, you only wore your backpack on one shoulder. When that shoulder started to feel sore from carrying your entire load of books, you shifted it to the other shoulder. This should’ve been all the proof you need: that the most efficient way to wear a backpack is by using both arm straps. So why didn’t you? Because it didn’t look as cool and nonchalant as the single strap technique.
There are more examples: pocket protectors are nerd-wear, despite serving what is actually a pretty useful function. And for all the work automobile manufactures put into building incredibly efficient engines, for a while it seemed like they couldn’t design a hybrid that didn’t look like some sort of weird robo-ladybug.
Then, of course, there are these Dr. Cool Chill Sport Cooling Towel: a product that will make you feel cool, but cannot make you look cool. Because they’re pretty dorky, right? We can all agree on that?

Could it possibly be that its utility and efficiency are the very things that make it ‘uncool’? Have we reached a point in our evolution where our aesthetic preferences have grown so strong as to overrule what had been humankind’s guiding principle up to this point–the so-called ‘the survival of the fittest’–and this sharp turn will eventually spell our downfall as the universe’s (heretofore discovered) dominant species?
Whoa. Got a bit deep there.

Dearest Anthony,
It is with a heavy heart that I compose this letter. When you return from your stint with the touring company, you will find me gone, and while we will always be brothers, I will no longer be welcome in our family’s house.
As you might suspect, father discovered my designs. He left for the park to perform his troupe. It was a production of Twelfth Knight, and while he had mentioned that it had been adapted for sock puppets, he made no indication that such modifications involved a shortening of runtime. Thus, I thought I would have nearly three hours of uninterrupted work time. When he arrived home just forty-five minutes later, he found me hard at work on my makeshift drawing table.
Now, I know what you are thinking: why did I not simply lie? You instructed me to do just that when I first confided in you about the designs. But Anthony, I have been lying all my life. I attended L’Academie Royale De L’Art Textile to study sock puppeteering at the age of fifteen. The instructors told me I could emote more with my wrists and palms than most classically trained thespians could with the whole of their bodies. I graduated at the top of my class and received invitations from several of the most renowned touring companies. I traveled the globe. By the age of seventeen, I had performed for two kings and six queens. But it was never what I wanted. I didn’t want to be a sock puppeteer like father and like all of our uncles, like grandfather before them, like you.
And I told father so. When he found me at my drawing table and asked what it was I was scribbling, I confessed everything: that the pretense under which I had returned home–to found my own sock puppet theater–was untrue; that I wanted no longer to act with socks but make my own socks, socks that, in their design alone, possessed as much vibrant life as could be instilled by a skilled sock puppeteer.
Father did not appreciate this, of course. He scoffed at my plans. He told me that out there, beyond the cardboard walls of a sock puppet theater, socks were not lauded but ridiculed. He said there was no such thing as a vibrant life-affirming sock out there. He said they were simple and drab, a mere treaty between foot and shoe.
Moreover, he said I have two options: I must either cast my designs into the fireplace and resume my pursuit of sock puppetry, or forever be banished from his house. As the opening this letter has surely confirmed, I have chosen the latter. I will be traveling far away from here, all the way to the Americas.
So, fare thee well, brother. While it is unlikely that our paths will cross again, perhaps someday you will be in clothing store and you will see a brand of exciting colorful socks with my name upon them and know I have lived my dream.
Yours,
Ezekiel"	0.05			2018-08-22T04:00:07.337Z	0.3287164649283502	0.94	61717			0.03937749319454194	0.07019466178157474

We discussed this on Saturday: the new deal-type where we offer the choice between a reasonable number of something for a reasonably good price or an unreasonable number of something for an unreasonably great price. (Technically, there is a third option–not buying anything–which some might argue is the best choice for the best price, but hey, just let us have this, okay?)

That comes from user @Tawnyy (with a very slight edit). Congratulations, @Tawnny! For your prize, we promise to whisper “hey, thanks” to each order we ship your way!
Today’s Order/Hoarder product:
WWE TeenyMates!!!
What we’ve got here are some little mystery grab-bags containing cute-ified versions of your favorite (or least favorite) WWE wrestlers. As with each of these Order/Hoarder sales, we like to provide a little math breakdown: for $5, you can get 8 packs of them, which comes out to 63 cents each. On the other hand, you could get 64 packs for just $20. That’s 31 cents each, right? WRONG! Since you can only order 8 or 64, the first 8 cost $5, and the last 56 cost $15, which means those last 56 are costing you just about 27 cents each! That’s one quarter and two pennies! And when you consider that each pack contains 2… that’s less than 14 cents per wrestler!
And if you’re like, “why would I need 128 of these things?” here are a few helpful suggestions:


Put a bowl of them at the end of your desk at work, and if anyone asks you why, just say, in as condescending a voice as possible: “It’s healthier to hold a tiny wrestler than it is to eat candy.”


Give them away at your kids’ parties. Do you kids and their like wrestlers? Great! They’ll love these things. Do they not like wrestlers? That’s okay too. They won’t know who any of these people are and you can just call them L’il Fun Buddies or something.


Isn’t it about time your little Christmas village got some extreme new residents?


Glue them to your dashboard and let them intimidate you into being a better driver.


Carry them around with you and conduct a social experiment called: how many random people on the street will catch a little wrestler when you say to them: hey you, catch this little wrestler?


You do realize it’s only 71 days till Halloween, right?

Why does that seem relevant?
Oh, we know: it’s because, while we’re selling it for $49, it actually retails for just north of $100 over there. And so all these people who are saying “Awesome bag” or “I LOVE THIS PACK” or “Bag is amazing” or simply “Perfect”–they’re happy to have spent three-figures on these thing!
They could’ve put that money towards two week’s worth of groceries or a few gas tank’s worth of gas or a few months of internet or a vending machine snack every Monday through Friday for a third of the year, but instead they spent it on a bag. And not only did they not regret it; they LOVED it.

Let’s just get right to the basic question here: what is so damn smart about these Smart Stands?
“Smart” has come to be synonymous with “online” or “connected to wifi.” But these Smart Stands are neither. They are an amalgamation of plastic and hinge. There is no voice control or app so you can manage it while you’re on vacation or built-in analytics to tell you how you might best use it in the future, based on your past trends. They just sit there and holds up your tablet or phone.
And maybe in that way they’re the smartest of “smart” products: because they’re smart enough to know what they do well, and also to know what they don’t need to do.
The past is a veritable web of failed innovations. Just like no one wanted pasta from Panera or personal pizzas from Subway, nobody’s pining for some bullshit half-functional beta-level technology to do something that was already extremely simple. Being “smart” is not just creating new complicated functions to prove you can; it’s pausing before you do all the work and asking, “Wait, why are we doing this? Is this actually necessary?”
But you know who didn’t skip that step? Smart Stands. They asked, “Why?” And they said, “Because sometimes you want your tablet to be up like this rather than down like that.” And then they asked, “Should we go further?” And they decided: “No, because the further we go, the more we risk losing our greatest asset, which is that our stands are universally compatible with all phones and tablets.”
See, sometimes intelligence is knowing when to stop and say, “Good enough for me.” Which is why these smart stands are good enough for you, no matter what kind of device you prefer."	0.07			2018-08-19T04:00:02.021Z	0.46941764127665553	0.94	53660			0.024072699552649

Yes, we mentioned the blender bottles sale from a couple Saturdays ago in yesterday’s write-up, but we were mostly talking about the bottles themselves. Today, we’d like to talk about the sale.
See, that sale was an experiment. We offered two choices: a rational number of bottles (the 4-pack) for a good price; or an irrational number of bottles (the 16-pack) for an even better price, with no middle ground. We wanted to know, could we bait you into making a totally ridiculous purchase just by making you feel like you’d gotten a ‘great deal’?
The answer, in a fair number of cases, was ‘yes!’ And so here we are again.
Now, before we get to the product, we need to name this as-of-today recurring sale type. Some ideas:
The Excess Express: Because like an express train, there are few stops between where you should go and the end of the line!
DTB: Does it stand for “Down to buy”? Nope! It’s “Direct to Basement.” Because you don’t need to pretend you’re actually going to use all this stuff! Take one out, deposit the rest downstairs with all the other stuff you thought was a good investment!
Any or Many: Pretty self-explanatory. Other option, along these lines: “More or Less.” Other other option, along these lines: “Deal or Mo’ Deal.”
Irrational Numbers: Are these deals really that much like the mathematical concept of irrational numbers? Yes–because the logic of either is hard to explain–but also no–because only one of them will make you feel smart.
(Also, hello nerds, who are right now gearing up to compose some long screed in the comments about how, well, actually, it’s not that difficult at all to explain irrational numbers!)
Anyway, you can vote on those on today’s poll (and give your own suggestions). Who knows! Maybe if this works, we’ll have a whole spin-off site where do only this kind of deal! Eh?!
As for today’s product, here’s some info: they’re power banks, so it’s not exactly as impractical to have a bunch of them as it was with the blender bottles. Also, we sold something that looks like these before, with the shoe sole pattern, but these are the 6000mAh version, whereas last time they were 9000mAh. On the plus side: that means they’re smaller. On the downside: that means they have less charging capacity (each one can carry enough power to charge the average phone about 3 full times, rather than 4 with the other version).
But really, what’s important is THE DEAL! Because think about: at 2 for $12, that’s $6 per power bank. Not a bad price at all. BUT if you opt for 10, and assume that the first 2 cost $6 each, that means the last 8 cost just $24, or a mere $3 each! And if you go deeper and consider that each of those 8 is rated at 6,000 milliamp hours, that means that you’re only paying $0.0005 per mAh! And $0.0005 is basically nothing, and a lot of nothing is still nothing, therefore, WE’RE PRETTY MUCH GIVING THESE THINGS AWAY!
Okay, maybe we kind of flubbed up the logic there. But the question remains: do you want a boring old 2-pack of Xsories 6000mAh Power Banks for $12 or an amazing 10 for $36?!"	0.07			2018-08-18T04:00:05.333Z	0.3572084668612603	0.93	53049			0.024494294870486415

You probably saw the word “blender” and the word “bottle” and thought, why do I need this thing when I just received my 4 or 16 pack of blender bottles? But the products are actually very different. For example, the blender bottles we sold before were both blenders and bottles, whereas this is a blender that comes with two vessels for blending that are themselves bottles.
Or, to put it differently:
The blender bottles are bottles that can blend things inside the bottle, whereas this is a blender that blend things inside one of the two bottles that come with it (or more than two, if you order more than one blender, in which case, you simply need to multiply the number of blenders you order by two to ascertain the number of bottles, which again, are not blender bottles, but bottles that work with this blender).
But here’s the thing: even if you ordered the blender bottles, you can still order this blender and bottles, because the blender and the blender bottles (not to be confused with the bottles that come with the blender) can be used together (although, obviously, the blender and the bottles it comes with can be used together too). See, blender bottles we sold a couple weeks ago, having only a small metal ball rather than a blade or a motor (like this blender has), aren’t really great at being blenders, but they are good at whisking things (so maybe they should be called ‘whisker bottles,’ although on second thought, maybe not, as that sounds like something altogether different and unappealing).
Point is, you could use the blender–this one, the one with a motor and a blade–for more intense blending jobs, like making a fruit smoothie. Then, you can pour the smoothie from the blender’s blending bottle into a blender bottle and take it with you wherever you’re going, so that you can whisk it back together if it settles.
What we’re saying is that what you should really do is buy this blender and two bottles and then pour the things you make in the blender’s bottles into one of your blender bottles, while using the bottles that come with the blender just for the initial blending.
Unless you didn’t buy the blender bottles. In which case, disregard the above."	0.05			2018-08-17T04:00:10.364Z	0.30912710887561573	0.94	60832

Well, this is a first from our branded content romance novel collection: a teenaged paranormal love story! Please enjoy these excerpts of The Heart Races Until It Rests by Annborny Hilledale.

Ellie met Henri while running.
She was not looking for love. When she’d quit the cheerleading squad to join cross-country, her boyfriend Brad, the quarterback of the school’s football team, dumped her because her running gear didn’t look “as hot.” She was relieved more than anything. She was a senior and she had decisions to make: did she want to go to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Oxford, or one of the other ivy league schools she’d gotten into?
Really, Ellie wanted to got to a small liberal arts school and study poetry, but it wasn’t up to her. Both her mother and her father were founders and CEOs of very powerful companies, and they’d both fought so much about whose company Ellie would eventually take over that they’d gotten a divorce. The only thing they could agree on anymore: Ellie had to study business.
Her Polar Heart Rate Monitor beeped helpfully to let her know her heart rate had risen above her optimal zone. Ellie often ran too fast when she got anxious about the future.
She slowed down, which was when the boy appeared at her side. ‘Appeared’ because Ellie hadn’t seen him approach. “Good day!” he said with a smile. He looked about her age but also–Ellie couldn’t exactly describe it–almost sepia-toned? He wore a strange antiquated cotton shirt and cotton shorts and his shoes appeared old-fashioned, with almost no support. “The name is Henri. I’ve just begun to undertake the task of what I’ve heard referred to as ‘cardiovascular activity’ and I was wondering if you might allow me to accompany you!”
Ellie looked at her Polar Heart Rate Monitor again. Its easy-to-read screen let her know that she’d reached her workout goal for the day. “Sorry. I’m actually just wrapping up.”
Henri looked at his shoes, disappointed. “I understand,” he said.
“But tomorrow,” Ellie heard herself say. She didn’t know why. There was something interesting about him. “I’ll pick you up at your house and we’ll go for a jog. Where do you live?”
“Just past 229 Healy Street.” Something seemed to occur to Henri. “But upon a secondary thought, t’wouldst it be possible to meet right here?”
Ellie agreed. The plan was set.

For all his grandstanding about not understanding ‘cardiovascular activity’ Henri never seemed to get tired. They talked the whole way about classic poetry. Henri was very familiar and spoke about the poets in a funny way. Like with his look, Ellie couldn’t exactly place the strangeness of his tone except to say it seemed that he often spoke as if he knew the poets personally. She chalked it up to an affect, of which Henri had plenty!
“What is that strange jewelry you wear?” he asked at one point.
“This? It’s my Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Its convenient display makes it easy to track my total calories burned per session as well as provide a weekly training summary.”
“Is it expressly designed for this very activity?”
“Nope! It’s great for biking, circuit training, or even just walking. Here do you want to try it on?”
“Oh, that’s not necessary–” Henri started to say, but Ellie had already stopped and slipped it off her wrist. Had this all been a ploy to take his exceedingly pale wrist into her hand? Did she have a growing desire to touch him? Perhaps, but Henri seemed uncomfortable, and they ran the rest of the way in silence.
Later, when she uploaded the data easily to her free profile at polarpersonaltrainer.com by way of her Polar Flowlink, she noticed something odd. The data for her run was there, but around the time she put the watch on Henri, all heart rate readings went blank.
“Huh,” she said. “Must be an issue with the monitor.” But her Polar Heart Rate Monitor had always worked flawlessly before…

It kept happening. Each day, the Polar would continuously display her own heart rate, and when Henri would wear it for the second half of their run–something Ellie insisted on, as a means of testing its functionality–there would be no reading.
But she didn’t know how to tell him something was wrong. Just as they managed to remain in the optimal zone for burning fat thanks to the Heart Rate Monitor, so too did it feel as if they were always in the optimal zone for conversation. She could tell Henri anything and he seemed to understand: about her parents, about her college decision, or about her day at school (from which he was conspicuously absent).
Finally, one day she couldn’t help it.
“Henri,” she said. “I need to tell you something. I’m in love with you.”
“And I need to tell you something,” Henri said. “Ellie, I’m a ghost. The ghost of Henri Olson, a long forgotten poet who died in his teens.”
Ellie should’ve been surprised, but somehow she wasn’t. “So that’s why your heart rate never showed up.”
“Alas!” he cried. “But if it could, it would read a number so high, as just the sight of you sets me aflutter! You see, I have unfinished business, Ellie. I have never felt love.”
“Never?”
“You must understand: it was a different time when I was born. We weren’t worried about heart rates. If we could have such a glorious device as that Polar when I was growing up, it would not measure calories but risk of scarlet fever. In such a dangerous time, can one ever feel true love? I say no, despite writing so many poems about it. But with you Ellie, well I’ve been trying to deny it. To admit so much would be to finish my unfinished business…”
“Just kiss me,” Ellie said. She leaned forward with her eyes closed and their lips met. She tasted no salty sweat on his lips, despite that the Polar Heart Rate Monitor said they’d really been pushing themselves. But of course she wouldn’t. Ghosts didn’t sweat, not even beautiful ones.
In the moment before she could open her eyes, Henri whispered: “Ellie, I love you.”
Ellie found herself alone on the road.

The dean of the English department at the small idyllic Halpern College ushered Ellie into his office. She didn’t wear her Polar Heart Rate Monitor because she was afraid her rapid nervous heartbeat would set off an alarm.
“It’s quite unusual,” the dean said, “for a freshman to win our annual award for gothic poetry, but the imagery you’ve presented–of the final kiss, of riding your bike past his supposed address and finding a graveyard, all of it–it’s just so lovely. Such a wonderful imagination.”
“You could call it that,” Ellie said.
“So I’m pleased to say, as your reward, we will purchase any book for the library in your name. Now, don’t be afraid to take some time to think it over–”
“The Collected Works of Henri Olson.”
The dean cocked his head to the side. “I don’t think I’ve heard of him?”
“He died very young,” Ellie said, pretending to rub her eye to wipe away a tear. “But he–I mean, his poems–they were really quite lovely.”"	0.05			2018-08-16T04:00:03.517Z	0.23418002803322968	0.94	61944

Friends, before reading further, lock your doors, turn on all of the lights, and gather your pets and loved ones tight, because the following is a horror story.
We begin with a young man. Let us give him a name. Let us call him Sean.
This all happened some years ago, when Sean was just a naive young man who believed, due to being brought up in the Northeast within proximity to a certain corporate food chain, that donut shops could be relied upon for iced coffee. It was this misunderstanding that will ultimately lead to our story’s tragic end. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Sean, walking the streets of Seattle on a hot summer afternoon, entered a donut shop–not one of the fancy ones you may have heard of; a small, out-of-the-way place that will remain nameless–and asked the man behind the counter, “Do you have iced coffee?”
The man replied, “Yes, we have iced coffee.” Or no, that’s not it. That’s not it at all. What he said was: “Yes, I can do iced coffee.”
This should’ve been the tell, the sign that something was amiss and Sean should flee that donut shop. But he ignored the portents. He removed a small bill and said, “Great, I’ll have an iced coffee then.”
What happened next is almost too gruesome to put into words.
Almost.
The man behind the counter took a large styrofoam cup, filled it with ice, and proceeded to pour hot coffee from the pot directly over it, handing Sean, to his horror, a lukewarm watery mess.
But do not grieve for Sean. Do not shed one single tear over his ruined attempt to seek cold caffeination. For Sean is a complex protagonist, and he is not without blame here.
Because why was he even seeking to purchase an iced coffee in the first place? Why was he not buying beans in bulk and then using this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Bundle to make his own deliciously smooth and delightfully cheap iced coffee at home? Perhaps, if he had, the day before, loaded up the 1.6 qt. cold brew carafe–or the bottle, which he could’ve carried with him–he might have avoided such a cruel fate.
As is the case with many stories of terror and woe, this is a cautionary tale. Do not, dear reader, make the same mistake Sean made. Buy this bundle and live forever in cold coffee bliss."	0.05			2018-08-15T04:00:09.341Z	0.31881841989687204	0.93	65238

“JUST ONE BUTTON to press. No more fear of breaking a glass or swallowing mercury.”

And you’re reminded that there was a time when, in the name of health, we put a glass tube of an extremely dangerous chemical into the mouths of children.
Children.
Children who might heave their favorite toy across the room just to see if it can fly. Children who eat the erasers on the end of a #2 pencil because it looks like gum. They were given a tube made of glass–the most satisfying of all smashables–filled with a weird, perhaps even delicious-looking, red substance.
Kids these days have it easy.
Or do they?
My mom, a nurse, always had a cupboard in the bathroom stocked with the most up-to-date medical paraphernalia. Therefore, we had a digital thermometer from the beginning. It was nice. Like this one, no mercury. Like this one, an easy straightforward digital readout of your temperature. Unlike this one, it took what felt like a half-hour to give a final verdict on whether or not you’d reached that magical realm north of 98.6 and earned the day off from school. And so, it wasn’t uncommon for the temperature-taker to put the thermometer in the child’s mouth and then walk away to take care of something else, allowing the child freedom to manipulate, through a variety of means, the final result.
This is hypothetical, of course. I would never have done such a thing.
(Oh, and also, just an FYI: that whole 98.6 being the average human temperature thing is the result of tests conducted by one doctor using a crummy armpit thermometer in the 19th century and is mostly bullshit.)
These thermometers, meanwhile, can register a temperature in seconds from the mouth or the forehead, thus disallowing for any alteration of results.

On day one, we sold a Roomba. That was in July, 2014. In the last 5 months of that year–our first 5 months of operation–we sold 5 more Roombas. We sold one or two in 2015. Since then, nothing. No more Roombas…
UNTIL TODAY!
What’s the best metaphor to capture the excitement of our reunification? Perhaps we could think of ourselves as a once famous rock band who amicably splintered to pursue our solo careers. We would certainly be the experimental-minded keyboardist, doing avant-guard work with help of speaker docks and vacuum sealers, whereas the Roomba would be the pop-forward frontman, producing hit after hit, each one more-or-less the same.
And now comes our glorious reunion tour!
(Although, now that I think about it, don’t bands usually reunite when the “well has run dry,” so to speak? As in: a last ditch effort to regain their former wealth or reputation?)
How about a different metaphor: in the 2015 we let the Roomba go off to clean, and now, after many years of service to the greater world, it’s made its circuitous way back to Meh, its noble charging port!
Nice pivot, eh?
Anyway, as we implied above, in the time since we last sold a Roomba, there have been, by our estimation, 6,000 new models released, all of which look almost exactly the same. So, if you’re wondering why you should buy this Roomba instead of a different Roomba, we are too.

It doesn’t have wi-fi like the 890, so it doesn’t work with Alexa or Google Assistant. Nor does it have the improved sensor capabilities of the 860. But it does have a lot of the other things that make those models great, such as a big bin and an AeroForce High Efficiency Filter, meaning the air that passes through it comes out a lot cleaner (which could be a big deal for allergy sufferers).

When the employees arrived at their first day at the new NOTILUS headquarters, they noticed something strange.
“There is no roof,” one of them said.
“Exactly,” said one of the higher-ups. “It’s an open-roof open-office.”
“But we won’t be protected from the rain,” said another employee.
“Exactly,” the higher-up said again.

It sounded whenever a storm approached, at which point, the employees took the tarps provided to them and covered their computers, their phones, anything that could succumb to water damage. Then, they stood. They closed their eyes. They waited for the rain to wash over them so that they could understand it, become one with it.
Thus, when they engineered their shower heads to have 6 settings including “Wide Rainfall” and “Power Rain,” they knew these to be the true to their names.

The great philosopher Zaza Pachulia once said: “Nothing easy.” He was referring to the 8th seed Atlanta Hawks forcing a game seven against the 1st seed Boston Celtics, but his words are applicable to so many things in life. For us, there is “nothing easy” about balancing our standards for honest copy with our desire to offer a diverse range of products. Some days, it just seems untenable. And friends, today is one of those days. Because if I gave my 100% honest opinion of this ProCabello Straightener and Styler Kit it would be this:

Really the point is, it’s difficult to write about something without any personal attachment to even the concept of it. That’s why so much copy looks like… well… copy. But that’s not what we want.

Are they outside of the greater Meh community’s comfort zone, too? Maybe. Only time (and all of the graphs at the bottom of the page) will tell.

We’ve got another weird item pedaling vague impossible-to-prove pseudo-science, so that means another installment of THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE: a feature wherein we lay out the product’s claims and explain why we’re not so sure we believe them. Here goes!
The Claim
The Pure Daily Care Diffuser is the “ultimate starter pack for essential oil enthusiasts.” The various botanical oils are “100% pure” and also “100% organic” with “no fillers or additives.” All of this is fairly simple. Where it gets more interesting is in laying out the benefits of each included oil:

Peppermint is a “mental stimulant” that “provides energy”;
Orange is a “respiratory stimulator, antiseptic, antidepressant, aphrodisiac, and neural stimulator”;
Tea Tree is a “powerful immune stimulator”;
Lemongrass is “neural stimulator” that “soothes aches and pains while also reducing anxiety”;
Lavender is another “neural stimulator” that “reduces stress and anxiety and promotes restful sleep”;
and Eucalyptus is a “respiratory booster” and is “great for relieving sinus congestions.”

The Skepticism
Perhaps I shouldn’t call myself skeptical here. I’m not skeptical. I think this is bullshit, and moreover, I think it’s pretty dangerous. Not the diffuser itself, but the language.
Because eucalyptus oil will not relieve sinus congestion in a meaningful way. And lemongrass oil isn’t going to help with your sore joints. And orange oil is as much an antidepressant as the two day old styrofoam tub that held raw chicken in the trash is a depressant. By which I mean: walking into a house that smells bad sucks, and therefore will make you feel unhappy; so, conversely, walking into a house that smells good doesn’t suck, thus making you happy by contrast.
This is all to say that if you have sinus issues, or joint pain, or depression, don’t just buy a diffuser. See a doctor.
But again, this is an issue of language, specifically language that makes empty promises. The actual truth is essential oil diffusers are great. They don’t smell as fake and chemical-y as plug-ins. They’re not smokey like incense. It’s kinda cool to watch the mist rise out of them. And this one has 7 neat ambient light settings.
That’s why my wife and I are buying one: not for any medical reasons, but because we just moved into a new house and we want it to smell okay. Even when I forget to take out the trash…
In Conclusion
Diffusers are actually pretty nice, as long as what you’re looking for is a good smell, and not a cure."	0.05			2018-08-08T04:00:06.259Z	0.21768616353254416	0.94	62973

It’s been a while since we’ve been able to dip into our library of branded content romance novels, but luckily, we found one that just happens to involve today’s product. Get ready for a tale of desire and medical emergencies in these excerpts from Gene Harmony’s Love Is A Medicine Best Served At The Appropriate Temperature(s).

People were always asking Dale to open jars because of his amazingly strong arms. And people were also always asking why, when he could so easily be a model, he chose to work at the front desk of a pharmaceuticals lab. “Not everyone wants to be on the runway,” he’d say with a smile of clean white teeth that reinforced his model-like qualities. The real answer, though, was that he’d always had the desire to save lives. Working here, where so many important medications were developed, was the closest he could get.
Dale wasn’t the only one in the lab whose good looks were surprising. Rumor had it that Dr. Liza modeled to pay her way through graduate school on the way to becoming the world’s foremost expert on life-saving drugs. Whether that was true or not, Dale had to admit: she was beautiful. Even now, as she rushed up to the desk in her lab coat, clearly flustered, she looked exquisite.
Dale thought maybe she was coming to flirt, something that happened often, though nothing ever came of it. She was a lauded scientist, after all, and he a lowly receptionist. But flirting was not on the agenda today.
“Can I ask a big favor?” she said. “No one else is available to help and there’s a patient in need of an experimental medication. We have to get to the hospital, so it can be safely administered. Could you give me a ride?”
“No problem,” Dale said, standing.
“But there is a problem,” Dr. Liza said. “It’s a complicated medication, comprised of three very volatile liquids that cannot be combined until the last possible minute before being administered. Also, each substance must be kept within a certain temperature range. If I leave them in their test-tubes, they’ll grow too warm or too cold on the ride over.”
“I have just the thing,” Dale said.

Dale and Dr. Liza carried the four Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs out to his car: three filled with temperature controlled substances, one extra, “Just in case,” Dr. Liza had said.
“We need to be careful with these,” she said now, but it was not an issue at all, given that the Primulas’ contemporary attractive twist-textured design allowed for a secure grip. Not to mention they were splash-resistant! “And you’re sure they’re not contaminated?”
“Absolutely,” said Dale. “It’s very easy to clean the mugs themselves. And I put the lids through my dishwasher at home, on the top rack, where it’s safe for them to go.”
Dale could tell that Dr. Liza, though still nervous, was happy to hear this. And she was even happier when she saw that all four mugs fit into the various front- and back-seat cup-holders of Dale’s modest hatchback. “Like a glove,” she murmured to herself. “Maybe I’ll be okay after all.”
“What’s that?” Dale said.
But Dr. Liza didn’t repeat herself.

They’d left the lab an hour ago. The hospital was only five miles away. Yet, they found themselves only halfway there, stuck in unmoving bumper-to-bumper traffic. The reprieve in Dr. Liza’s anxiety, brought on by the various positive aspects of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs, proved temporary. Out of the corner of his eye, Dale had watched her grow more and more upset–first sitting straight up, then tapping her fingers on the dash and sighing loudly.
When she finally spoke, her voice cracked with fear. “It’s no use. We’re getting nowhere. We need to administer the medication now.”
“But how are we going to do that?” Dale said. “The patient is at the hospital.”
“No, I said we need to go to the hospital so they can administer it safely. The patient isn’t there. Not yet. She’s here. Dale, it’s me.”
“What?!”
“Look at me, Dale,” Dr. Liza said. “You’re going to have to administer the drug that’ll save my life from the disease I’ve kept a secret all these months.”
“But, but…”
“There are no buts about it,” Dr. Liza said. She pointed to one of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs. “See that Primula 20oz Insulated Mug? You told me that–with its double walls, vacuum seal, and triple-layer Copper Cold Technology–it can keep liquids hot for up to 8 hours and cool for 24. It makes sense that you’d have such a mug, because you’re a lot like it. You want to save lives. I’ve seen it in your eyes, and like a giant beautiful man-shaped Primula 20oz Insulated Mug, you keep that desire at the appropriate temperature so that it never dies.”
Dale nodded. She was right. He’d waited his whole life for this. Without a word, he got the empty Primula and carefully mixed the contents from the others together in it. “Now, what do I do?”
“It needs to be applied to my lips,” Dr. Liza said. “But first, it requires vermilion stabilization, meaning it must be applied to a healthy pair of lips, and then transferred from those lips to the taker’s.”
Dale understood what he must do. He gravely opened the easy-open, easy-close lid. It was straw-compatible but he didn’t need one now. He let the liquid touch his lips, and then he leaned over the center console to Dr. Liza…

Dale paced. He held a Primula 20oz Insulated Mug. He had cleaned it and filled it with coffee from the hospital waiting room two hours ago when he arrived, and it was still hot.
Finally, the doctor appeared. “She’s recovering,” he said, “thanks to that experimental drug she made and thanks to your administering of it. Still, to be safe, we’ll give her regular doses of it every four hours.”
“And how will you give it to her?” Dale said, feeling strangely jealous. “Do you have a machine for vermilion stabilization?”
The doctor looked at him, confused.
“You know,” Dale said. “It needs to be applied from healthy lips to the lips of the diseased.”
“It’s taken orally, son,” the doctor said. Then a sly grin came across his face. “If I had to wager a guess, I’d say someone has a crush on you!”"	0.05			2018-08-07T04:00:06.333Z	0.5387061168679262	0.92	64187			0.11531935223472428

“Do not cast your pearls before swine.”
People spoke these words without thinking, for a moment, of how they would hurt me, a pig. But more than speak them, they lived by them. Every time I walked into a jewelry store, they quickly rushed to put away their finest pearls.
I told them, “But it is me. I am not a descendent of some clown like Porky. My grandfather built the first ever wolf-proof house. He patented his  special structurally-sound brick-laying technique, and it has been used in the constructions of homes the country over, including three governors’ mansions. He passed his business down to my father who passed it down to me, and now, my net worth is somewhere in the high nine-figures. So please, allow me to purchase the great jewels of the sea.”
Still, I received nothing.
Then, one day, I saw a New Yorker cartoon. One dog sat on the floor, listening to another, seated at a computer. The caption read: “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” For many, it was simply humorous. For me, it was instructive. I realized this was the easiest way to pearl ownership: the internet.
Since then, I’ve made a point to purchase all pearl and mother of pearl jewelry I see for sale online. Truthfully, I don’t even like pearls that much, but I buy them anyway, just to enjoy the warm feeling of a symbolic victory.

You get 2 pairs of Maroo ICE Headphones, but when you receive them, you might think you accidentally ordered 8. Because despite their “smaller fit for women’s ears,” these things come in an unnecessarily big and complicated box. User @Chakolate sums it up pretty nicely:

What is a problem is the amount of packaging. The unopened package is 223 grams, of which 11 grams are the actual headphones. They come in a jewelry-type velvet box, which is nestled in a lot of plastic, which is inside a thin cardboard box, which is wrapped in tissue paper. They also include a carry pouch, and a thick little book about how to use them. (Seriously? They’re kidding, right?) The end package is about 8x3x3"", which is absurd for headphones.

And in case you need some idea of how big that actually is, here’s a picture.

For context, the can next to it is 16 ounces. It’s also a delicious hazy New England style IPA as good as any I had back east from the best brewery in Des Moines! (In case anyone from Confluence is reading and wants to give me some swag.)
Now, you’re probably thinking: “All that stuff for some bedazzled earbuds? What a waste!” But you’re not looking at the big picture. All the various packaging materials are not simply for this product; they’re for a bunch of different things we’ve sold over the course of the last year. For example:


You can cut up the plastic casing and put them in your Ray Ban Eyeglasses when one of the lenses breaks.


You can use the jewelry case to hold your Diamond Encrusted Eternal Heart-Shaped Pearl earrings.


You can use the pouches for safe transport of your WWE TeenyMates.


And you can use the tissue paper when you move to wrap the little espresso cups you got to go along with your Nespresso Vertuo.


Because everyone buys every product we sell, right? That’s how this is supposed to work. We put up an item each day, and you, in turn, buy at least one of that item each day, but preferably two or three.

Four Blender Bottles probably seems like plenty of Blender Bottles. You have your Blender Bottle, your backup Blender Bottle, a Blender Bottle to try weird stuff in, and a Blender Bottle to give away when your friend is like, “Oh, I should get a Blender Bottle like that.”
Sixteen Blender Bottles is probably too many Blender Bottles. Even if you’re very clumsy with your Blender Bottles, or very experimental, or have a lot of friends who want Blender Bottles, you’re still probably going to end up with a few leftover Blender Bottles.
So why should you get sixteen Blender Bottles?
Because it’s possible that this is the best ever deal on Blender Bottles. You’re probably thinking: sixteen Blender Bottles for $49? That’s about $3 per Blender Bottle. Not bad, right? But it gets even better, because really, if four Blender Bottles costs $20, that means you’re really getting twelve Blender Bottles at $29. So you’re looking at a cost of less than $2.50 per Blender Bottle after the initial four Blender Bottles.
(Which, side note, makes for a great conversation starter. The next time you have some friends over just point to the pile of Blender Bottles in the corner–and there will be a pile of them in the corner; you have sixteen of them, after all–and say, “See that Blender Bottle? That Blender Bottle only cost me $2.42.” Just, make sure you point to one of the last twelve Blender Bottles, not one of the first four Blender Bottles, because as we’ve established, those Blender Bottles cost more.)
With savings like that, can you really pass up buying sixteen Blender Bottles?
You can?

The FoodSaver conference room was tense. Nobody knew why the emergency meeting had been called except that it involved “a failure in marketing.”
Finally, Richard, the sixty year old exec who’d sent out the invite, arrived.

One thing they’re using it for is something called ‘Sous vide,’ which I believe is a religion, so we’ll want to be very careful there. But the other thing is–” Richard looked around, and spoke in a hushed tone–“they’re using it for marijuana.”
“They smoke through the machine?” asked Terry, age fifty-two.
“That’s what I thought at first,” Richard said. “But it turns out it’s more for storage and keeping it fresh. Anyway, there’s a whole bunch of people doing it. I found a message board where everyone was snap-chatting about it. The Red Edit.”
“It’s called Reddit,” said the intern, age twenty-one. “It’s the ‘trees’ subreddit.”
“Nope, that’s not it,” said Richard. “It’s definitely not about trees. Your generation wouldn’t understand because your Woodstocks were different. Anyway, we need to cash in on this, and we need to cash in on this NOW. We need a marketing campaign. Something to appeal to the youth.”
“But you just said my generation–”
“Quiet, intern. The adults are talking. Now, let’s spitball a little. What do we got?”
“What if,” said Tony, age fifty-eight, “we do one of those internet pictures and then make it go viral?”
“I like that,” Richard said. “That’s a good plan: a viral internet picture.”
“I’ve seen one particular internet picture,” said Harry, age fifty-eight, “where there’s a man pointing at a butterfly. The man will be labeled, and the butterfly will be labeled, but the man will be saying, ‘Is this a something-other-than-butterfly?’”
“Because it’s labeled as something else,” Richard said.
“No,” said Harry. “I should’ve mentioned that too. He doesn’t call it what it’s labeled, either. He calls it something else. I believe that’s part of the joke.”
“Okay, so,” said Terry, “we label the butterfly ‘FoodSaver’ and the man as ‘consumer’ and he’s asking: ‘Is this a thing for storing my reefer?’”
“Ganja,” said Tony. “Let’s say ‘ganja.’”
“Good catch,” said Richard. “We need to use relevant terms.”
“Also, underneath the question,” said Harry, “it should say, ‘Yes, and you can has it!’”
“That’s with the cat, right?” Richard said.
“No,” Terry said. “Cat says, ‘hang in there.’”
“Well, this has been very productive,” said Richard. “Good work, team. I’ll send this along to the design department. I’ll tell them to redraw the image in case there’s a copyright issue and to get us twelve potential samples by this afternoon.”

In other words, it wouldn’t hurt to just have some around this time of year.

And this is exactly the secret I’m talking about: winter only happens outside!
Everywhere else, it remains warm enough to drink refreshing smooth cold brew. At home. At work. Even in the car. Actually, especially in the car, after you’ve given it some time to warm up, when it becomes basically a mobile sauna.
What’s funny is that this secret hides in plain sight. Think about it. Do you bake your salads in the winter? Do you pour a bottle of Coca Cola into the kettle and set it to boil? Do you say to the bartender, “I’ll have the IPA, but nuke it on high for 45 seconds”? Sure, a hot toddy, a nice soup, or a steaming mug of hot apple cider is nice. but even in February, these things aren’t as ubiquitous as a glass of cold water and a deli sandwich.
In other words, it’s totally easy to normal to drink cold brew coffee year round. The only tough part is when you walk from the warmth of your car to the warmth of your house or your office with your cold cup in hand.

This MOKCAO POWER+ Cordless Speaker is compatible with the 2nd Generation Amazon Echo Dot, which essentially means this is a vessel for Alexa. She’s called a “digital assistant” but it’s around now, in the fall, where she begins to feel entirely digital and of little assistance.
Alexa can’t rake leaves, and she’s terrible with a leaf blower. Ditto for scraping the frost from your car’s windshield.
You can ask her to help bring the potted plants in from the porch, and she’ll refuse each time, regardless of how polite you are. As if she doesn’t understand SHE works for YOU!
Alexa can tell you the Bolivian city Oruro’s population. She can tell you who serves at its mayor, or what kind of climate it experiences. She can probably tell you its exact coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. But she has no fucking clue where you put your damn sweaters after you moved this past summer.
With certain home systems, it’s likely possible that Alexa could adjust your house’s internal temperature and turn on certain lights at your request. But she is powerless to slow the gusts of wind that keep knocking off the dead branches from the trees in your backyard, or halt the encroaching darkness that aims to devour large swaths of your day.
And herein lies the crux of why you should buy this now: while Alexa might not be of much assistance in the fall, you’ll want some time to get used to her. Because winter is coming, and as the world begins its annual descent into cold darkness, you’ll find yourself spending more and more time inside. You’ll need someone to ask for soup recipes, or to help you find upbeat music to play, or to read you temperatures in Australia where summer is just beginning.

They say variety is the spice of life, but switching up the spices themselves doesn’t make something entirely new. What’s better: trying an entirely new method of cooking. Take sous vide cooking, for example. Using a slow, rotating hot (but not boiling) water bath to cook your food (which itself is sealed inside a plastic bag) will allow for levels of tenderness heretofore unexperienced.
But as with all things culinary, you should know what you’re getting yourself into. So, instead of spending two-grand on some state-of-the-art sous vide oven that you may or may not enjoy using, try one of these. It will work with any pot and is small enough to be stored easily, while also giving you a taste of what sous vide cooking has to offer.
…is what you can say to whoever you give the second one of of your two Power Precision Sous Vide Cookers to. The real truth is: by giving away one of these to a friend or family member you’re actually giving yourself a gift.
Sous vide cooking is fun. It’s weird. It’s a lot different than most basic cooking methods. And because of that, there are tricks you’re bound to pick up along the way, little ways to improve your food’s flavor, or methods that maybe make it just that much easier.
Still, you’re bound to have some blind spots. Cooking is like having a problem to solve, the problem of how to get all these ingredients into a cohesive “meal.” As such, everyone’s going to come at it from a different angle. And knowing how another person approaches something might help you figure out the best way for you to do things. Thus, by giving your second Power Precision Sous Vide Cooker away to someone you know, you’re basically getting an assistant chef. Or maybe an IRL Youtube tutorial without the terrible five minute intro.
Then again, if you’re giving someone the gift of a sous vide cooker to receive the gift of advice for what you should use your sous vide cooker, you might involuntarily give them the gift of some advice about how they should use their sous vide cooker… which means, you’re only getting one gift while they get two.

Dearest Martha,
I wish I could say that I miss you. Alas, to suffer only a heavy heart would be a great relief! The truth is much worse than that. I write this letter because I am in grave danger, and I fear that I will suffer not death, but something much worse: a living death of sorts.
Yes, “fear”: a word you likely never thought you would see your husband write. For eight months, I cohabited with wild gorillas. For eleven, I roamed with a pack of wolves. For three, I swam with electric eels. I was buried a whole year among the bulldog ants of Australia in an attempt to understand their tunnel structure. Never once, in any of those cases, did I feel even remotely afraid. But none of them compare to this.
Though it may void my contract with the research firm, I will give you the full details of my current assignment: I was sent to integrate myself into a community of EarPod wearers, so that I might discern once and for all what makes them such incredible assholes.
I have, for the last month, been living among them somewhere in the Bay Area in what I believe is an apartment, but also seems to be a concert venue and startup. The startup is focused on an app of some kind but no one here actually programs. They all work as “organic social marketing disruptors” though many also dabble, I’m told, in graphic design. They wear their EarPods always. And so do I.
This is what I mean by a living death, Martha. Since putting the EarPods in, I have begun to have thoughts that seem not to belong to me. At first it was just, PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT on a constant loop. But as I acclimated, I began to think things like It’s too bad the world isn’t as present as me, or My podcast is better than this one, or What idiot called these EarPods instead of Lil’ Listenies? The other day, I thought once again about them falling out, but this time, it was, If these EarPods fall out, what’s going to keep my head from floating away?
Martha, I am losing it. Or: I am losing myself. So please, come quickly. Unfortunately, I am not sure my exact address, so you will have to fly to San Francisco and look for posters for a show we are hosting, featuring a performance by an artist named Transl8. He does electro-folk, as well as politically-conscious trip-hop.
Also, please bring a pair of Rowkin Bluetooth Earbuds. Just as I needed to take measures in order to avoid the bends when I resurfaced after spending those weeks with the angler fish, so must I do the same now. And those Rowkins are stylish, wireless, and way less obnoxious than EarPods. They should return me to myself in no time.
Make haste.

So, on the one hand, this seems like a smart move for us. Not everyone wants a blanket printed with something, especially not a logo for a deal-a-day site. It can feel like you’re basically an advertisement.

On the other other hand, you’re saying you’d prefer not to associate with us every day you choose not to buy something.
On the other other other hand, maybe buying the blank blankets is more insulting, because you’re coming here, seeing what we’re selling, and saying, “We’re willing to take your blankets, but we don’t want to help you out with some free advertising.”
On the other other other other hand, you are paying us, which does help.

On the other other other other other other hand, that leaves more blankets for you!
On the other other other other other other other hand, this is short term thinking. You might enjoy hoarding blankets now, but eventually the thrill will be gone, and you’ll be left with only blankets and no love. And besides, weren’t you just saying how lonely you were?
On the other other other other other other other other hand, no: it was not you who was lonely. It was me, the man with eight hands, six blankets, and no friends.

Think of your favorite Christmas mornings growing up: you woke up after barely sleeping, rushed to the tree, and tore open your presents. Then maybe came some reprieve–maybe you ate some pancakes and drank some hot cocoa–after which the real fun started: you spent the next several hours painstakingly assembling a tiny model from even tinier pieces so that it could sit atop your desk forevermore!
Okay, maybe that wasn’t exactly how it went. Probably, you played video games, or with some new action figures or dolls. Maybe you watched some movies on TV, maybe you ate more pancakes, drank some more cocoa, maybe you didn’t get out of your pajamas until four in the afternoon when it was time for Christmas dinner, and maybe you were ready for bed at seven, the calories and the sporadic sleep from the night before combining into a potent sleep aid.
And I wouldn’t blame you if that’s what you chose to do. Because those things are more enjoyable than building a model. But here’s something to think about: are they as satisfying?
Because there’s an important difference here. Yes, you might enjoy a candy bar more than taking a jog. Yes, you might enjoy bingeing ten seasons of some guilty-pleasure thriller on Netflix more than spending the afternoon preparing a five-course meal for your visiting relatives. And yes, you’re probably going to enjoy sitting around on the couch on Christmas overindulging in food, toys, and TV (or for adults: food, booze, and basketball) more than building the tiny model of the Eiffel Tower that you got in your stocking.
But you won’t be as satisfied.
Anyone who’s ever done anything requiring a modicum of will-power and ingenuity–even if only to solve a minor problem of their own making–knows that the accompanying frustration quickly gives way to a more lasting pride. Every deep breath you take all day will remind you of that jog. For weeks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment after making that meal. And while you might regret all of the pancakes and cocoa and movies and Christmas cookies well before December 26th, you will always be able to look at your model and think, with a smug sense of satisfaction, I did that.

Ah yes, another gummy purporting to have some vague healing properties. Sounds like the perfect starting point for a rousing round of…
THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE
Here’s how it works: we give you the claim the product makes, explain why we’re more than a little dubious, and then in the end, we come to some conclusion (if ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ can be considered a conclusion). Let’s get started!
The Claim
CBD is “a natural constituent of hemp” that “has been shown to have positive health benefits.” But since it contains no THC, it won’t get you high. Thus, it supposedly can help treat stuff like pain and anxiety with less risk of endless philosophizing or nachos.
The Skepticism
Here are pretty much all of the things we can definitively say about CBD:

It is short for cannabidiol.

Did we get all that? Does anyone need anything repeated? In the back? Can you all hear me?
Okay, that’s a simplification. There’s more. For example, we also know that, like Hansel, this CBD shit is just so hot right now. According to a New York Times article by Alex Williams, Willie Nelson is launching a line of CBD-infused coffee beans (two of his favorite things in one cup, he says), Mandy Moore is toying with it to see if it helps relieve the pain of walking in heels, and Glamour magazine ran a story with the headline “I Replaced My Entire Beauty Routine With Only CBD Products.” I am linking it here as proof. I refuse to actually read it, which I consider an act of self-care.
But what does it actually… do? Gabe Kennedy a twentysomething CBD start-up founder offers this:

Comparing it to the feeling after an intense meditation or yoga session, Mr. Kennedy added that the CBD glow has “synergistic downstream effects” in terms of social connections. “Around others, I find myself more present and attentive, more creative and open.”

To put my reaction in terms that Mr. Kennedy’s ilk would understand, I’d say the ROI on reading that paragraph was that I experienced an exciting disruption in the mouth sector, which, had I not cupped my hand over my lips, might just have gone viral all over my keyboard.
But while it’s fun to mock the eye-roll parade that the article provides, it also validates the claim made by Christie Aschwanden over at FiveThirtyEight: “the marketing has gotten way ahead of the science.”
Aschwanden is definitely more focused on the what than the why. Her article’s thesis is pretty well summed up by its headline: “Does CBD Really Do Anything?” There are definitely some serious WTF moments in here too. For example, when CBD-pedaling doctor Joe Cohen makes the claim that it has anti-cancer properties and might even help with Alzheimers, Aschwanden raises concern that these effects weren’t discussed in two of the most significant cannabis-focused reports out there. The good doctor’s reply: “I think you just have to Google search it.”
Moreover, though, she raises some important points, most notably that we don’t have mixed messages when it comes to CBD; we have almost no messages at all, because very few tests have looked at it on its own:

Animal models and a few human studies suggest that CBD can help with anxiety, but those are the only conditions with much research on CBD in isolation.

Otherwise, most studies focus on cannabinoids more generally, where they have actually found “‘conclusive or substantial evidence’ supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain in adults, multiple sclerosis-related spasticity (a kind of stiffness and muscle spasms), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”
Though, this assumes you’re getting a real dose, which also seems to be up in the air:

There are no guarantees that the label accurately reflects what’s in the product. For a 2015 study published in JAMA, researchers tested 75 products [cannabis] purchased in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle and found that only 17 percent were accurately labeled. More than half of the products contained significantly lower levels of cannabinoids than the label promised, and some of them contained only negligible amounts of the compounds.

The Conclusion
When we promise something here, we hold ourselves to it, so here comes: after reading about CBD, we can say, conclusively, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . But actually, it seems not to be super risky and to have some potentially great outcomes. So if you’re feeling anxious or a little achy, give it a try. Like most of this stuff, if you don’t think of it as a cure-all, you should be fine."	0.06			2018-11-02T04:00:05.893Z	0.42612956253890216	0.93	66292

It’s easy to come up with jokes about these things, and not just because they’re called “Lovesac Sactionals.” Like, imagine replacing all of a friend’s furniture with these one night, so they awake and believe they’ve grown. Or imagine a business man who uses them in his office as a power move, so that whenever someone comes to meet with him, they have to sit crouched to the ground feeling small.
But really, this hilarious world I’m describing, where everything is out of proportion is actually what young kids experience all the time, just inverted.
As @Superllama7 helpfully points out, “kids and pets can also use adult-sized furniture.” This is true, of course. Yet adult-sized furniture doesn’t really give kids a sense of ownership. Kids have toys and books. They have a bedroom they might share, and a bed to sleep in. But rarely are they given their own little space for quiet comfort in daytime, which is too bad, because it’s something they might like.
@2palms’s daughter did, at least: “with the double-wide seat she can get a leg up, then camp out in the corner with her books.” If that sounds super cute, I’ve got news for you: it is. @2palms includes two adorable pictures of “quiet morning reading time” on one of the 2 “chaise lounges” they put together. (@2palms elsewhere describes the Sactional furniture’s sturdiness, in case that’s a concern).

I, Clive Grunley, am not a mere athlete. Nor a biathlete. Nor a triathlete or anything so simple. No sir, I am a sexdecathlete, if you know what I mean!
What I mean is I compete in competitions comprising of sixteen distinct athletic feats. Why do you look so surprised? Did you think a sexdecathlete was something else?
A traditional sexdecathlon begins with a twenty mile run (1). Next, is a swim of at least 4 miles (2), but additional miles can be swum to earn tokens which can be used to hire additional bridge builders to help you build the bridge (3) back over the body of water you just swam across.
After that comes the javelin toss (4), followed by a short sprint (5), in order so that you can catch the same javelin you just tossed (6), and then, while holding it aloft, discuss with several gifted undergraduates how the javelin can serve, in literature, as a metaphor for one’s ascension and subsequent decline (7).
This is followed by a water break, which is not a break as in a moment of reprieve, but another event wherein each competitor builds a mold, pours water into it, freezes it, and then breaks the sculpture upon the shoulder of a competitor before they have one broken over theirs (8). Those who lose are disqualified, and given a strong handshake by those continuing on (9).
Next, you chop down a tree (10), then climb at least halfway up the tree (11), and carve some part of the three into a surfboard (12) while it is falling, so that you have something to ride when your tree eventually lands in the wave pool. You then ride a wave (13) to the artificial “shore” wherein a meeting ensues among remaining competitors as to how you might maintain the tree-related events while also promoting sustainability (14).
Which leaves nothing to do but cross the finish line (15) and exchange high fives (16). Yes, these count as events, as the finish line is a moat filled with poisonous snakes and we call them high fives because they must be completed atop a nearby mountain of you and your high-fiving partner’s choosing.
Anyway, the point being: after a long sexdecathlon, I’m beat. And I need at least three Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Packs to sooth my aches. I especially like that the texture provided by the ceramic beads allows for a nice massage. And let me tell you, us sexdecathletes might all be different, but every one of us likes a good rub!

If you’re shopping for yourself, you can get any food processor you want. You can take your parents’ old food processor. You can go to the thrift store, find one, search around for an outlet to make sure it spins, and take that one home. Or maybe you don’t need to go through all that trouble; maybe you just buy it as soon as you see it. If it doesn’t work, oh well! It was only a few bucks.
But if you’re getting someone a food processor as a gift, you need to do a little bit better than that. You don’t want to give your husband or wife or newly married friend something used that you’re pretty sure works. You need to give them something clean, something shiny, something new.
More than that: you need to give them a brand they’ve heard of. Because, come Christmas morning, you don’t want to have to lean over and say something like, “Chop Corp actually makes great food processors. You might not have heard of them, because they’re only sold in Kroger grocery stores in and around Columbus, Ohio. But they’re actually assembled from leftover Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach parts so that every model is functional and unique! And if you want, I watched a few youtube videos about replacing parts, so we could really ‘hack’ this thing, so to speak. Here, I have a screwdriver and soldering gun! Let’s do this!”
It’s much better to say, “It’s KitchenAid, so you know it’s good.”
If you want to say more, you can. For example, you could talk about how its drizzle basin allows for the easy incorporation of liquid ingredients. Or how it has two speeds and pulse so you can make anything from a chunky salsa to a smooth hummus. Or even how the work bowl, lid, and blade are all dishwasher safe.

Four truths and three lies about the artist Adam Koford:


Adam Koford, as a shirt designer often under the moniker of “Apelad”, has sold more than 260 designs on websites like Shirt.Woot, including several that this former Woot copywriter often still thinks of and laughs aloud.


Adam Koford’s art studio is in a house boat currently floating in international waters, the only place he can execute his diabolical pencil hold without being taken into police custody.


Adam Koford was, for a time, a jockey. He and his horse Maple Syrup were dominant, winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. On the track of the Belmont Stakes, though, disaster struck. Just feet from the finish line, Maple Syrup collapsed in a cloud of gray smoke, at which point it was discovered Maple Syrup was not a horse at all, but a robot powered, at its center, by a tiny car driving on a tiny treadmill.


Adam Koford is the creator of Laugh-Out-Loud Cats, a webcomic which can be viewed at HOBOTOPIA.com, as well as in a new book, One More For The Road, COMING SOON (stay tuned to Hobotopia for an official announcement in a couple weeks). A few months ago, he posted his 3000th Laugh-Out-Loud cats drawing. And since pictures are each worth a thousand words, that means Koford has produced the equivalent of 3 million words, the equivalent of somewhere between 30 and 50 novels. That’s impressive!


Adam Koford opens bananas by making several exacting surgical incisions with a scalpel. The peel-removal process can take up to two hours, but according to Koford, it’s worth it. “If you respect the fruit,” he says, “it will in turn respect you by unlocking heretofore hidden flavors.”


Adam Koford has worked as a senior writer and story artist on the video game versions of Bolt, Toy Story 3, and Cars 2. Which means he can say things like, “I wrote Toy Story 3,” and not technically be lying!


Adam Koford designed today’s shirt.

That kind of relief can feel almost euphoric, because it’s basically freedom. You don’t need to sample anymore. You don’t need to settle. That little operation in your brain that you’ve been forever running in the background, looking for that special something, can be discontinued, the energy rerouted.
But as strong as the relief can be, it is often matched by the subsequent disappointment. They tinkered with the formula of the hair gel. They changed the shape of the running shoe.

Many considered A Portal Among The Pages, published in 1978, to be the book that marked science fiction author Hal Pembry’s ascension from merely great into the canon. His previous seven novels to that point had been entertaining and thought-provoking, but few managed to evoke the magic that Portal  seemed to achieve so easily. As one reviewer wrote, “When Finley [the book’s protagonist] first finds the Encyclopedia of Time, he does not know that it functions essentially as a time machine, yet he senses something special between the covers. Readers might find this sensation quite relatable, as they sit in their favorite chair, holding Pembry’s masterwork aloft.”
His fans were eager to see what he would come up with next. And they were profoundly disappointed when the answer turned out to be: nothing. Pembry never wrote another book. In fact, he disappeared altogether. Many assumed he’d gone the way of other successful literary eccentrics–that the fame had been too much for him and so he’d retired somewhere quiet for a life of seclusion. Others posited that the terrible film adaptation had driven him to flee out of embarrassment. A small faction of particularly conspiracy-minded fans put forward a theory of murder at the hands of Kyle Tolliver, a rival author driven mad by jealousy because his own stellar novel’s release had been eclipsed by Portal (this being a pun many newspapers made while discussing the books’ relative sales, as Tolliver’s concerned a deadly solar eclipse).
None of these theories came close to the truth. In actuality, Pembry’s novel was a confession of what was to come: he’d discovered a way in which he could, through literature, bend time. I know because he told me when I spotted him last week outside of a used bookstore in Omaha. He did not look a day older than his author photo from forty years ago.
I asked what he thought of life in our current age and he said, “It’s okay. There are many things that science fiction foresaw, only different in minor ways. There are robots that work for you, but the one’s that move have no personality, and the ones with personality don’t move. They live in speakers and phones. And then there’s that.”
He pointed to the GOTRAX Hoverfly ECO Hover Board I had ridden up on.
“I’ve read all about those. About how their electrical safety is certified, about how they can go nearly 8 miles per hour and up to 12 miles distance before needing a charge. It’s truly a work of ingenuity. Only, when I and many of my contemporaries had imagined hover-vehicles, I thought they would truly hover. Again, it’s not that I’m unimpressed. Sometimes, I wish there was just a bit more whimsy. At any rate, I ought to be going.”
I asked him where and he corrected me. “It’s when,” he said, then told me to name a year. 1919 was what came to mind, and he took out a small unmarked book from his blazer pocket, opened it to a specific page somewhere in the middle. “Ah,” he said. “Interesting.” He pointed to a line written on the page. I tried to lean over and see but in that moment, there came a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew, Pembry was gone."	0.05			2018-10-26T04:00:03.801Z	0.24495605686952773	0.93	63926

We all have our preferences when it comes to luggage. Some of us prefer the hard-sided rolling bag. We like that what we see is what we get, that its shape remains steadfast always. We find comfort in knowing that our things will be safe inside. Perhaps we go on a vacation and buy a commemorative glass; with our hard-sided luggage we can be sure that it will be safe, as long as you don’t pack it too loosely. You don’t have to worry about some other bag in the cargo crushing it.
Others of us prefer the duffel. It’s casual but also classic. It can go down the street to the gym, or across the world to Shanghai. If you don’t have much to pack, it’ll take up less space. You can pack lightly or overpack a little bit. Its soft sides are forgiving. Also: they’re malleable. Pack one full of clothes, and you can squeeze it almost anywhere. It’s like a firmer pillow.
And yet…
There are times when we wish our hard-sided luggage had just a little bit more give to fit in the tight space behind the passenger seat of a fully packed car. And there are times when we’d like trust our duffel to hold its shape just a little bit more. For example, when we travel to wine country in Oregon, we want to bring back a bottle of wine, not a bag full of wet wine-scented clothing and some decorative shards of glass.
In other words: when it comes to bag-style our preference is not as firm as we might think. And facing this knowledge, it quickly becomes clear that the options aren’t hard-sided or duffel. They’re:

We can refuse to choose. We can eschew bags altogether. We can wear all of the clothes we want to bring on a given trip, layered over each other. The top layer can be pair of cargo pants and a hoodie with a big pouch. In the pockets: our toiletries, our travel knickknacks, our phones, etc.

Or…

We can choose both. As in, we can buy one of each: a U.S. Polo hard-sided bag, and a U.S. Polo rolling duffel. If we’re going for ten days at the vase expo, we can bring the hard-sided luggage. If we’re driving across the country and want something that’s easy to roll in and out of motels every night, we can take the duffel. But with both, we always have what you need.

Okay, fine. This is manipulative. If you really want to buy just one or the other, that’s fine too… But know this: some day, you might regret that choice–some day, you might need those hard sides or that soft top–and when that day comes, we won’t be able to help you.

There’s a double-standard here. If you buy a shirt that’s slimming and shave every day because your facial hair comes in patchy or comb your hair a certain way that looks best with your face-shape, it wouldn’t be considered inauthentic. If anything, it’s the opposite. It shows an intelligence, an understanding of what you have and what works best. Because none of those things are harmful or uncomfortable or particularly time-consuming. They’re just simple steps you take to look your best.
On the other hand, if you try to slow the thinning of your hair–or at least slow the appearance of your hair thinning–that’s considered inauthentic. It’s mocked. Men are told that going bald is embarrassing, but also that covering up baldness is embarrassing. Because it exhibits some denial of reality, a fight against what nature has intended for you.
To which, we reply: Yeah, no shit! And there’s nothing wrong with that!
Maybe at some point, we can all wear ponchos, choosing between three or four each morning based solely on thickness of material. Those who are not going bald will stop cutting their hair, and those who are going bald will allow their hair to recede without ridicule. We will all stop showering, and we will all stop brushing our teeth, and we will cease complaining about the natural odors of our bodies and breath. And if some lose their teeth because theirs are weak, they will drink only nutritional juice of a greenish-brown color, and no one will judge them for it.
Until then, we just gotta do what we gotta do to look whatever way feels best. And if that’s using a hair fiber and locking spray, so be it.

“It’s not them either,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s certainly dolls and stuffed toys,” the exorcist proclaimed. “Raggedy Annes and Andys, sock monkeys, and teddy bears, all singing ironic songs of friendship while stalking your every move, each brandishing pencils sharpened into shivs.”
“Actually,” the toy seller said, “it’s fidget spinners.”
“Wait, what? Fidget spinners? Seriously?”
“I’m afraid it’s very serious,” the toy seller said. “They just won’t stop… spinning.”
“That’s it,” the exorcist said. “They’re just spinning? Like fidget spinners do? But on their own?”
“Exactly! And I have work to do! But I can’t anything done! Because I’m so distracted by their infernal noises! Some of them even glow!”
The exorcist nodded. “I understand. They glow brightly with the spirits of the dead.”
“Nope,” the toy seller said. “They’re just the LED kind. And they don’t all glow very brightly. They’re pretty hit-or-miss, to be honest. A lot of them are fine, but the lights on some are dim, or out entirely. That’s why we’re selling them for cheaper than the non-LED ones.”

The toy seller did not object. In fact, he hugged him and thanked him with tears and his eyes. The exorcist assured him it would all be okay.

Welcome to everyone’s favorite day: Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, wherein we offer a new shirt or whatever every Sunday until, eventually, we get lazy or forget and it ends! Today’s shirt requires a little more explanation than the others. Basically, it’s the Casemates launch shirt, on royal blue… BUT you get a choice: the original sketchy version of the logo (and that’s sketchy as in sketch-like; not like, “it can’t be trusted”) or a new exciting more geometric-looking logo!
That leaves you with four potential purchase choices:
You Purchase The Classic Design
This the option for people who respect tradition. You want a shirt you can wear each night when you return to your victorian home and settle into your bergère chair to re-read Don Quixote. What’s that playing in the background? Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16, of course. And what’s that you’re drinking? Maybe a glass of 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir, or maybe a Boulevardier cocktail that you’ve been antiquing for a few days in a mason jar in the fridge. It all goes just smashingly with your new (or should we say old?) Casemates shirt!
You Purchase The New Design
Here, we have the modern choice. You’ll look right at home wearing this when you pull your electric car into the driveway of your house, a recent construction comprised, it appears, of only the most jagged of edges. Inside, you’ll ask your digital assistant to play the latest release from your favorite musician, a masked individual from a country far away who makes electronic music that is one step removed from the dial-up modem noise. Then you’ll settle in to read a collection of experimental prose poetry while sitting on a piece of brutalist furniture that might be a couch but also might be an end table; you can’t remember. What you are sure of: how comfortable you feel in your exciting new Casemates shirt!
You Purchase Both
This one goes out to all those who toe the line between classic and modern. You like mid-century modern furniture. You listen to blue-grass covers of new wave songs and new wave covers of blue-grass songs. In short, you appreciate all things: from the old and traditional to the new and innovative. If we may be so bold: this is definitely the best choice.
You Purchase Neither
This choice, on the other hand… well, it’s not really a choice at all. It’s the absence of one. You’ve essentially chosen not to choose. To put it bluntly, you are empty. You see stories about rescue dogs on Facebook and feel nothing. you stand directly in front of the elevator doors waiting for them to open, not because you’re in a rush, not because you think you’re better than other people, but because you haven’t thought at all. Often, you feel as though you’ve forgotten something. Your phone? No. It’s in your pocket. Your wallet? No. That’s there too. Your keys? No again. Really, you have forgotten nothing; instead, what you’re experiencing is the sensation of your being crying out to fill the hole where a soul should be.
Anyway, hope this helps you make your decision! Happy Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, and until next time (if there is a next time)…"	0.07			2018-10-21T04:00:03.298Z	0.49400280593593765	0.94	54240

See, here’s what’s so annoying about this:
This is a drone. It does what drones do. It flies around for nine minutes, hovers in the air, etc. @Moose tested it. He said it actually was one of the easiest to fly, and might be the most stable of the ones he’s tried for our site. They could’ve marketed it for that: its ease and stability.
Or maybe they could’ve called it a photo drone or a video drone, because it does have a camera that can take 1.3MP pictures and 720p videos. After all, drones are often used for photos or videos. My pretty basic wedding package featured a video done with a drone. Remember that shot at the end of 10 Things I Hate About You, of the band playing on the top of building while the credits rolled? That shot probably required licensed pilots, a helicopter, crew members, waivers, the works. Now, anyone could make something that looks like that, for, I’d estimate, 5 figures less thanks to drones. Like this one.
And no: a Remake-The-Last-Shot-Of-10-Things-I-Hate-About-You-Or-Something-Like-It Drone isn’t exactly going to move units here in 2018… but it would probably be better than Selfie Drone.
Like, are you fucking serious? The phrase “selfie drone” is verbal ipecac. It takes ingenuity and renders it into an overcomplicated way for millennials to engage in the act that has become synonymous with the self-absorption most other generations (wrongly) know them for.
Still, what annoys me isn’t the how clear it is that this product was definitely named by some old dude thinking he’d discovered a new way to “reach the youth.” It had to be, by the way, because, say what you will about millennials, they at least know what a selfie is, and a photo that you need a drone’s angle to capture is not a selfie; it’s a photo with you in it. There’s a difference.
What annoys me is how reductive it is. It’s a dumb marketing 101. It thinks it’s carved out some entirely new lane in the drone game by catering to the selfie-obsessed among us, without taking into account the large number of people that it would turn off. Like, there are probably folks who arrived at the site today, read the product name, and said, “oh, no way,” and navigated away without reading another word. Or even if they did get further, they might still be thinking, It could be cool… but cool enough to risk my friends seeing a box that says “Selfie Drone” on it in the week before the recycling gets picked up? I don’t know…
That’s what really annoys me. But it doesn’t annoy me that much, to be honest. I mean, there’s a reason we can sell this thing here for $20. And it’s not because it’s a bad drone."	0.07			2018-10-20T04:00:46.966Z	0.34139579152096994	0.94	51885

Dear iRobot,
You’ve done what many companies aspire to do, but few actually achieve. In this stratosphere of success, your company is elite: Xerox, Kleenex, Ping Pong. Your product’s name–the Roomba–is now synonymous with (or maybe even supersedes) the “robot vacuum cleaner.” Congratulations.
And many of us here at Meh have been along for the ride since nearly day one. Yet, there’s something that’s frustrated us over the years: every time we sell a Roomba, we realize the model is slightly different than the previous one, despite looking almost exactly the same. We then dive into hours of research, hoping to solve the mystery of what’s so different in order to help our customers make an informed purchasing decision–only to find, in the end,  something trivial, like the canister capacity being one tenth of a percent larger than before.
What we’re saying here, iRobot, is: help us. Or, help us help you. Why not give every  new Roomba a feature that really STANDS OUT, so that they can be easily differentiated?
For example:


You could make one that says “sorry” whenever it bumps into a wall. An another that cries out in pain whenever it bumps into a wall. And another that recites a poem by Robert Frost in a Mike Tyson accent whenever it bumps into a wall.


Or a model that kisses your ankles when it goes by so that you know it loves you.


How about a Roomba that can take all the crumbs from the kitchen floor and forms them into new snacks for you to serve at your next party?


Maybe one Roomba could feature “pie warmth and texture.” And then the ""Plus ""version of that model could also feature “pie flavor.” And it could just be a pie.


Or what about a Roomba that just came with one completely functional human finger? Is that too much to ask?


Look, iRobot: the sensors, the 3-Stage Cleaning System, the ability to automatically adjust to any floor and navigate around furniture–that stuff is cool and all, but it’s also what we expect. Why not give people something a bit more unique? It would certainly be great for us. And if it’s great for us, isn’t it great for you too?
Just something to think about.
Sincerely,
Meh"	0.05			2018-10-19T04:00:01.945Z	0.2510909468726189	0.92	61001

Twelve-year-olds Arthur and Lisa, having split up to cover more of the town, reconvened at the tree house to compare their trick-or-treat bounties. They’d both dressed as zombies, but even through all the gory face paint, their disappointment was clear.
“Another lame Halloween,” Arthur said. “It’s like, what’s wrong with giving out candy? Everyone around here tries to get too creative. I got the worst stuff.”
“You got the worst? Wait until you see what I’ve got,” Lisa said.
They sat down and began removing items from their respective glowing Pop Lights bags.
“Look at this,” Arthur said. “Someone gave me one Triscuit!”
“If you want something to dip it in, I’ve got a bunch of ketchup packets here from an old lady,” Lisa said. “Hey, what’s that sloshing noise?”
“Loose soup,” Arthur said. “The guy just ladled it into my bag.”
Lisa leaned over and looked. “Are those malt balls floating in it?”
“Nope. Meatballs. It’s Italian wedding.”
“At least you can eat that,” Lisa said. “I don’t know what to do with these ticket stubs from a 1992 Celine Dion concert.”
Arthur put on a pair of eyeglasses. “Let me see them.”
Lisa handed the stubs over. “I didn’t know you wore glasses.”
“I don’t,” Arthur said. “Someone on Fourth was handing these out.”
“New?”
“Gently used,” Arthur said.
“Maybe I could use them to read this.” Lisa pulled out a stack of papers from her glowing Halloween bag. “Guy on twelfth was giving out copies of his unfinished novel. And I need to have critiques back to him in two weeks.”
“How is it?”
“It’s okay. There are some point of telling issues. Like, if you’re going to use a retrospective POV, the narrator can’t be surprised by the events as they unfold. Also, some of the fantastical elements frustrate me. I keep thinking: what are the rules of this world?”
“Huh,” Arthur said. “I wouldn’t be much help. I’m a journalist, not a novelist. Or at least I am now that a woman on Church Street gave me this.” He handed a diploma over to Lisa.
“Wow, a journalism degree! From George Washington University! They could be really useful,” Lisa said, “for mopping up the soup!”
“Hey, good idea,” Arthur said.
“I have no idea what to do with this.” Lisa held a sheet of paper.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“An NDA,” Lisa said.
“For what?”
“I can’t tell you.”
The two of them fell silent for a moment.
“You want one of these I Trick-or-Treated 2018 stickers?” Arthur offered.
Lisa took one. “Thanks. You want any of these Spirit Airline points I got over on Main?”
“Sure. How about some opportunities to build real wealth and passive income through direct marketing? Someone on Grand was handing those out.”
“Couldn’t hurt,” Lisa said.
“That’s it for me,” Arthur said. “And to think: I thought my parents were the lame ones for handing out some fidget spinners they bought online. What a bust!”
“Actually, maybe it wasn’t a total bust. A family on Breezy Lane did give me this.” Lisa took it out and set it down between them.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“I think it’s another, smaller, Halloween.” Lisa pointed at something swirling. “See, look.”

Probably, we should lie. We should say that this is practical. We should say something like: you can garden from inside! We should claim something about how, with the success of HBO’s Sharp Objects, wealthy families have a renewed interest in dollhouses, and some of them are even hiring full construction crews to break ground and build them; get the heavy duty equipment your crew needs to beat out the other bidders!
But we won’t. Instead, we’ll look both ways, we’ll lean forward, we’ll gesture for your to lean forward too, and then we’ll whisper into your ear…
We’re selling this so you can give it as a gift.
We’re cautious to admit this because you know how people get. The holiday season is filled with camaraderie, but few forms are as cathartic as uniting against its annual encroachment. They’ve got the decorations up and it’s not even December, you’ll say to a stranger in the coffee shop. Are they playing “Jingle Bells”? Before Thanksgiving? someone will say in the checkout line at the grocery store. You’ll shake your head when Santa’s village appears in the mall before the first significant snowfall, or when you see a flyer informing you that Black Friday sales somehow start on Tuesday this year.
And here we are, making our first offering of the gift-giving season weeks before Halloween! What gall, you think. What nerve. But friends: hear us out. By offering this R/C Excavator today, we’re not trying to get a jump on anyone… but ourselves.
Though we don’t always act like it, at the end of the day, we’re a store. The holiday season should be our time to shine. And yet, to really “kill it” during the holidays, you need to be sure of yourself. You need to be organized, to know when things will ship and how long they will take to get to where they’re going. You need to build a balanced approached; you can’t just sell a bunch of toys or a bunch of electronics or a bunch of socks. You need to offer all three at different times based on sales trends from previous years.

FLEECE BLANKETS!
I don’t know about where you all live, but here, the weather has taken a dark turn. It even snowed yesterday! Which means: it’s time to make a nice cup of tea or cocoa and bundle up under a fleece blanket on the couch with one to twelve dogs and/or cats for the next five months.
THE MATH
The four-pack will run you $14. That’s $3.50 per blanket. Not bad, right? But wait! The twenty-four pack goes for $60. That’s $2.50 per blanket. But wait even more! If the first four cost $14, that means the last twenty cost just $46, which is $2.30 per blanket! Does it make sense to break it down like that? Probably not! But that’s how we do it here on Order/Hoarder days!
WHAT TO DO WITH FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
With four fleece blankets, you can put one on the couch, one on recliner, keep one in the office, and still have a backup to rotate in when one is being washed. Or, store them all in a closet and break them out for a late fall bonfire.
WHAT TO DO WITH TWENTY-FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
So! Much! For example:


You could give them out as gifts to twenty-four of your favorite people!


Or, if you don’t have twenty-four favorite people, give them as gifts to twelve of your favorite people! (You can use the remaining twelve fleece blankets as wrapping paper for the other twelve fleece blankets!)


Send one to each venue on your favorite band’s 24-stop winter tour to show you’re a true fan!


Or, give one to all but four members of the twenty-eight piece Swedish indie pop group, I’m From Barcelona, in case they have to play any cold weather outdoor festivals! If they complain about not everyone getting a blanket, just tell them you’re not the idiot who decided to start a twenty-eight person band!


Use them to build a winter-ready tent in the bank yard! Actually, hell, you’ve got 24 fleece blankets! Build a winter-ready tent mansion!


Interior decorators will tell you that the right lighting can give rooms a soft, warm feeling; we say, why stop at lights? Why not take that “soft, warm feeling” over the top by wallpapering your house with fleece blankets?


See? Maybe twenty-four fleece blankets isn’t so impractical after all.

Let’s start off general and work our way into more specifics. Every laptop manufacturer calls their product something different, but a Chromebook isn’t just a cool name. It’s actually a different kind of computer. Laptop Magazine sums it up nicely:

Instead of Windows 10 or macOS, Chromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. These machines are designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with most applications and documents living in the cloud.

In other words, if you live in a cabin somewhere in the mountains, and you have to hike and ski many miles back to civilization to grab a solitary bar of wi-fi, this might not be your best bet. Nor would it be a good option if you’re looking for a machine that can support your career cutting movie trailers and playing the latest computer games. These things are pretty sparse, in terms of power.
But for the rest of us, who pretty much never stray far from the router and who mostly use our computers for checking email, keeping track of things, writing, and organizing: a Chromebook is actually a pretty great, pretty cheap option.
And this one is actually both of those things: we’re selling it for just under $150, and on Amazon it has four stars on over 1,000 reviews.
Yes, if you want to be cynical, you could say: but wait, Meh, this thing came back out who-knows-when, and many of those reviews were written a while ago. And that’s true. BUT 1) there were still five star reviews coming in as recently as August of 2018; and 2) never underestimate the online reviewer. Like, these people self-identify as arbiters of all that is good (and not good) to buy; do you really think they wouldn’t rush to update their review the minute anything goes wrong?
Besides, let’s be totally honest: as much as we like to talk about the forward march of tech, most of us are still using our computers for the exact same things as we did five years ago. New apps come and go, but we’ll always need to make spreadsheets and type up documents and check our email.

Mr. Khool was the coolest teacher at Meh High. He taught an elective called The Mathematics of Skating, a class he only managed to get approved after bringing the principal to a skate park and catching phat air while explaining how each side of a halfpipe was essentially a graph of exponential growth. Now, he was on his way to teach his first session of it when, rounding a corner, he heard stifled sobs.
Narf, hunched next to the water fountain, tried to straighten up when he saw Mr. Khool approaching. “Oh, hey, Mr. Khool. I was just… uh… making sure the fountains weren’t leaking.”
“Sounds like the only thing leaking are your eyes, l’il guy,” said Mr. Khool, crouching next to him. “You want to talk about it?”

“I know what you’re going through,” Mr. Khool said.
“You do?”
“Sure! Being a cool guy is great, but sometimes it’s hard to get people to take me seriously. They think it’s all kick flips and cliff jumps, when really that’s only like 60 to 70 percent of what I do. There’s also a lot of hard work that nobody gives me credit for. But you know what? Whenever I start to feel like maybe it’s time to trade my longboard in for a Prius, I remind myself: there’s a reason progress and persistence both start with p. A friend of mine told me that once. His name was Tony Hawke.”
Narf’s eyes went wide. “Tony Hawk the skateboarder?”
“No,” Mr. Khool said. “This is Hawke with an e. He was Ethan Hawke’s second cousin. We played in a band together in college. And actually he went by Anthony.”
“So do you just call him Tony Hawke so people think you’re talking about Tony Hawk?”
“It doesn’t matter why I do it,” Mr. Khool said. “The point is, it’s a decision I made to call him Tony. And we all have decisions to make in this life. So, are you going to give up, or are you going to decide to keep chasing your dreams?”
Narf stood up. “You’re right! It doesn’t matter that it’s taken this long! I can’t give up now, not for anything!”
“That’s right! So, what is it that you’ve been asking for?”
“A cat shirt,” Narf said.
“Wait, seriously?” Mr. Khool said, getting to his feet. “But you’re Narf. You’re wearing a cat shirt right now. And you wore one yesterday. And the day before that. And actually every other day too. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the same cat shirt twice, now that I think about it.”
Narf slung his backpack over his shoulder. “Sorry, Mr. Khool. I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve gotta get to chem. Thanks again! You really said exactly what I needed to hear!”
“That’s great,” Mr. Khool said. “Although, maybe we need some other designs?”
But Narf was already off and running to his next class.

Douglas, We’re glad you’re here. We can see you’re confused, but don’t worry: all will be explained. You see, when LeAnn said to come home so you two could “take a scenic flight over a pristine lake” together, she was lying. This is an intervention. We, your friends and family–we’re all worried about you, Douglas.
It all began when you bought that Odyssey Stellar NX Drone. You said it was a way to bond with your son. But you didn’t let Trevor use it much, did you, Douglas? Still, it was a fun hobby for you. You liked that it came with a VR headset, so you could see from the drone’s POV. You would fly it, recharge it, fly it, recharge it, all day.
Only after a few months did we start to see the warning signs. You walked into furniture, cursing your legs. You started standing on the dining table to watch television. You called this “a more natural prospective.”
Then there was the mini drone that came with your purchase of the original drone. You started calling it ‘l’il guy,’ then ‘son,’ then finally you named it. It would’ve seemed cute, if you didn’t choose, ‘Trevor,’ the same name as your real son.
Yes, Douglas, that’s right: only one of them is your real son. Because you are not a drone, Douglas! You are a man! You might spend days coming out of drone-prospective for only as long as it takes your Odyssey to charge. You might spend these times with your eyes closed tight, whispering, “it’s a dream, it’s just a dream,” so as not to face the fact that you are a human being, and as such, you are bound by gravity to remain on the ground.
But it’s not healthy, Douglas! You have a family! You have a job! You have obligations! You can’t just ignore them because you have “a new life in the sky” now. It can be a fun hobby, but you’ll never really be a drone, Douglas. You need to start seeing that. And moreover, you need to apologize to all of us for what you’ve put us through. Let’s start with Trevor.

User @alacrity wants one thing and one thing only: a margarita.
When we sold a Copper Cookware set, they wrote:

well, I guess I could serve margaritas in these…

On a two-pack of posture trainers:

it has to be said: these make really shitty margaritas.

For a 2-pack of cast aluminum skillets:

well, I guess I could drink a margarita out of em… but there’s still the salted rim thing.

A coffee maker:

this will make very hot margaritas.

Earrings:

these are absolutely useless for margaritas.

You might notice that these are not all sales from the last few months. No, @alacrity has lived with desire for years. But that will change today. Because today we are selling a Cuisinart Waring Pro Blade Blender.
And yet the story does not end here. What we want to know is: how does @alacrity feel about this?
Will they arrive at the site today relieved? Will they cry aloud, “For many years I have wished for nothing more than a sweet lime-rich tequila cocktail. And at long last, the great Meh has delivered to me a device that shall itself deliver me to my own personal paradise. Thank you, Meh! Thank you so much!”?
Or will they feel some resentment? Will they realize, all too late, that the real margarita was the friends they made along the way? Or, to put it differently: is there any margarita that’s as sweet on the lips as camaraderie is to the heart?
And yet, there remains a fact we have not reconciled: uhh, like, hello? We’ve sold blenders before!
So perhaps we’re misreading @alacrity. Perhaps, they do not hope for their own margaritas at all. Perhaps they seek only to be a sort of margarita-specific town-crier, to stand in the virtual park at the center of Meh and warn all those around them about the dangers of attempting margaritas in products not optimized for margaritas.
And then of course, there is the final possibility: maybe @alacrity prefers margaritas on the rocks.
So what is it? Only time will tell. And by time, we mean: hopefully @alacrity in the forums."	0.05			2018-10-12T04:00:20.860Z	0.34750686103289724	0.94	59130

Watches? I never wear watches. Why would I wear a watch in the age of cellphones? That’s what I say. Because I believe in efficiency. It guides my every waking move, from the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the time I lay down to sleep at night. (That’s the alarm on my phone, by the way. Why have an alarm clock when you have a cell phone?)
But it’s one thing to say you believe in efficiency, and it’s a whole other thing to live by it. I know because I do. To prove it, I’ll run through my average morning:
First thing’s first, I make breakfast. It’s the same every day: spaghetti and meatballs. I have it for lunch too. And dinner. Food is food, isn’t it? Why should I have different foods for different meals?
When I’m done eating, I floss and brush my teeth, then spit into the drain in my shower. Because why have a sink when you have a shower? Is not a shower a human-height sink? Think about that for a second. Anyway, when I’m done brushing my teeth, I wash my hands with shampoo. Soap-products are soap-products, after all! Then I shave, checking my reflection in the mirror–by which I mean, my phone, on selfie mode.
A little bit of leisure time is part of being efficient too. So, before heading out the door to work, I take twenty minutes to relax. I might watch a show (on my phone) or read a book (on my phone). But soon enough it’s time to check the weather (on my phone). To confirm the app, I look out the window–the single window I have in my whole house. Why do I need to see out my house from so many different sides? Outside is outside, no matter what way you’re looking at it. One window is plenty.
Using this information, I decide what I’m going to wear: pants or shorts. I should elaborate; it’s the one garment, but it’s got a zipper so I can unzip them at the knee when it gets warm. It’s the same pair I wear every day, because again, for me it’s all about efficiency. Not everyone is a fan of this. My sister, for example, once said she actually hated my zip-on pant-shorts. She said I should switch things up by wearing something else sometimes. She said that by wearing them I was ruining her wedding. Can you believe that?
She hasn’t spoken to me since then, but I don’t mind. I still have another sister, and honestly, at the time, I was in the middle of a painful decision of which sister I would keep. Two sisters? Are you crazy? Who needs all that in your life?
Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh, right: these watches. Yep, don’t need them. Although, they would go nicely with the one sweatshirt always I wear, especially on days when it’s hot enough that I have to roll up the sleeves. And if you’re wondering why I don’t just take it off, it’s simple: I’m not wearing anything underneath. Wearing a shirt under what is essentially another shirt?

Imagine for a moment you’re a secret agent. You’ve been called upon to infiltrate a very important party held by a tycoon with designs to take over the world. You need to take a video of the party, so key attendees can be identified, and hopefully sneak into the study where you’re told the plans for the doomsday device are kept. For this mission, you’ll be provided with a PogoCam. It’s smaller than a tube of lip balm, attaches magnetically to your favorite pair of glasses, and shoots 5 megapixel photos and 720p HD videos. You just need to go to Q to collect it.
FYI: in this imagined scenario, Q refers to the dumpster behind the Qwikmart convenience store down the block, not the genius gadgeteer from the movies. Because, boy oh boy, would that guy steer clear of this thing.
In fact, over on Amazon the PogoCam only has 2.5 stars. That’s some real ruh-roh territory, especially given most products fall into a 3 star rating just by being delivered. People who bought it without the Pogotrack sunglasses offered here griped about the safety loop required when using your own pair.  Others complain about the picture quality or that it only takes 30-second video clips.  One user goes even further: “while I have little proof,” LE says, “[I] believe PogoCam has been the cause of much of the world’s turmoil lately.”
Not great!
But here’s the thing: since it’s come out and been revealed to be of less than desirable quality, the PogoCam’s price has tanked. In fact, I’m told that at one point is retailed for as high as $150. That’s nuts. But even with all those price drops, it’s still just shy of 50 on the 'zon.
We’re selling it for $24. For that price, it can just be a fun little gimmicky impulse buy. Wear it once or twice and you’ve pretty much justified the purchase. If you get it to work better than a bunch of Amazon reviewers and find some real use for it, awesome! If not, at least you got some sweet magnetic sunglasses out of the deal.

There were only two of them in the conference room, but when the engineer placed the SmartStand prototype on the table, his hands still shook with anxiety, as if he were making a presentation to the entire company. In a way, he was. Across the table sat the founder and CEO.
“Looks simple.”
“Just as you asked, sir,” the engineer said.
“So let’s talk features,” said the CEO. “It can hold your tablet or phone while you’re cooking, so that the recipe is easy to read?”
“Yes, sir,” said the engineer.
“And it tracks the ingredients used, placing orders based on what’s running low in your cabinet and refrigerator?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it intuit how romantic a given meal seems, and adjust the room’s lighting accordingly?”
“No, sir.”
“Does it feature an olfactory sensor that reads the smell of the meal and gives spicing advice?”
“No, sir.”
“Let’s talk about travel use: on an airplane, it can hold up your phone or tablet making it easier to watch a show or movie?”
“Yes, sir.”
“And it can place drink orders with the flight attendant, based upon the mood of said show or movie?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it message the gate attendants of your connecting flight, informing them when delays get in the way of your lunch or dinner plans, so they know to have a torta from Frontera waiting for you?”
“No, sir.”
“Tell me that it can at least read the forecast for your destination and place orders for weather-appropriate pants.”
“It can’t, sir.”
The CEO stared for a long time at the prototype. “So, it’s not ‘smart’ at all?”
“Well, sir,” the engineer said, “I like to think of it like this: by adding a number of attention-grabbing but ultimately unnecessary and overcomplicated ‘smart’ features, we’d only introduce the possibility for bugs and glitches. Not to mention we would have to put out different models for different phones and tablets. So, despite how it may seem, this is a ‘smart’ product, in that simplicity is smart, because it leads to ease of use and universal compatibility.”
The CEO pounded his fist on the table. “I like that! I like that a lot! Not smart is actually smart! That’s great! That’s gonna help me a lot, not just at work, but also in my personal life!”
“Actually, sir, what I said was simplicity is–”

We’re entering the time of year when everything freezes and dies and allergies are replaced by a sense of tired dryness. For some of you, this might be a relief. And yet, consider these two things: first, said dryness does nothing to dry up non-seasonal allergies, like those related to pets; and second, spring will be back sooner than you think with its pollen-thick air. And just like the smart shopper buys next year’s wrapping paper the day after Christmas when it’s marked down to nothing, so too does he or she purchase an allergen-optimized vacuum just as allergy season winds down.
And boy oh boy, does this thing suck up allergies. In fact, it “captures and traps 99.9% of dust and allergens down to 1 micron.” As a non-allergy-sufferer myself, I don’t know exactly what that means. I can tell you that, given the the word “micron” is pretty much just “micro” with an n, it sounds pretty small.
What I actually CANNOT understand is what the fuck “MultiFLEX Technology” is. I know that it “provides flexible reach for under furniture and freestanding, compact storage.” But what does that mean, exactly? Digging a little deeper, I found that the “MultiFLEX wand bends so you don’t have to, reaching under low lying furniture with ease.” So, apparently, it’s a kind of semi-flexible wand? That’s it? Seriously?

Yes, on one level, the design is simple: it’s the Meh face, or should we say, the many (meh-ny) Meh faces you see when you come to our site. It’s a button. You press it. You keep a streak going, if you want. Or else you don’t; you reserve the Meh button only to show your nonplussedness. It’s something that makes our site special, a little inside joke among you, the customer, and us.
But, on another level, the design means so much more. It’s a tribute. To us. And all we’ve done for the world of commerce. Before we came along, all was excitement, and much of it was false. Companies didn’t know that it was fine enough to be, well, fine enough. Everything had to be glorious and exuberant. But then we showed up, and we taught people that it doesn’t always have to be that way. You don’t have to worry about moving the proverbial needle. You don’t need to dial it up to a ten. You can hang out at a five if you want.

Now, most modern phones can be fully charged with between 2000 and 3000 mAh, which means even the smallest power bank we’re offering can charge your phone somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times. By that standard, you could get 2.5 to 3 full charges with a 6000 mAh power bank, and 4.5 to 5 with the 9,000.
But look, we’re not going to spend the next few hundred words talking math. It’s too abstract. The most helpful thing to do would be to provide brief profiles for who might require each power capacity, so that you identify yourself among them. Here goes:
4,200 mAh
Last time you went camping, your phone spent the entire night searching for a network it would never find. You woke up and had no juice, and while it turned out okay, you don’t want to risk it again. You need something that’ll charge your phone in case of an emergency, but you don’t need much more than that. Bonus point: you can bring it with you to work, because you work out of a truck that, strangely, has neither a USB port nor a cigarette lighter.
6000 mAh
One morning, you wake up and find a strange man standing over your bed. He explains: he’s a representative to the Corrigan Cartel, one of the most notorious crime families in Ohio. Recently, your little brother got in with them, except he didn’t make good on his promises. Now, they’re holding him somewhere, and the only thing between him and a pair of cement shoes is you. You’ve got a full day ahead of you, enacting archaic rituals and making shady transactions in a number of parks in and around Cincinnati. And let’s just say the Corrigans didn’t factor in any time for you to stop and juice up your phone. Which is a problem, because you need to be face-timing the entire time so they can be sure you don’t call the cops. In short: you’re gonna need some serious recharge power.
9000 mAh
You get a text from an unknown sender, a wrong number, you think. Or maybe it’s spam. It’s a tip on a hot new cryptocurrency. The text says it will change your life. Sure, you think with a chuckle. But you can’t help but be a little intrigued. So you follow the link to an app, and you start mining. You leave it going overnight. The next day, you wake up feeling significantly taller and stronger. You look at yourself in the mirror. Its as if you’ve been Photoshopped into a model. You find that you have an intense desire to work out. You go running and clock 18 miles easily. The next day you go further. And further after that. Soon you’re running up mountains just to get your heart rate going. You’ve made partner at the firm, which is crazy because you don’t remember becoming a lawyer. The paychecks are amazing. You’re constantly out hiking, skydiving, rock climbing, and cliff jumping. And all the while, you’ve got your phone with you, mining, draining your battery. You don’t want it to stop. You’re afraid that if it does, this will all come crashing down. And yet, you’re always setting off on some new adventure. You don’t get a chance to charge that often. You need a power bank, something with some serious mAh, in order to maintain this new reality.

Here’s the thing: if a smartphone, smartwatch, powerbank and a bunch of other things for just $99 sounds too good to be true… well, it is, sort of. Don’t get us wrong: this phone, like, works. It’s actually not that bad. But if you keep up-to-date with your upgrades and always choose the newest Samsung or Apple offering, you might be a bit less than wowed by this thing.
Then again, this sale isn’t for you. Really, it’s an intervention for the still-using-a-flip-phone crowd.
Look, it was cute for a while. You met up with your friends and a few of their friends, and they became your friends too, and at some point you took out your phone to exchange numbers, and everyone was like, “Wow! You still use that thing?” And maybe they laughed. Or maybe they were impressed, because you’d somehow managed to avoid the magnetic pull of digital progress.
But that was in 2013. Now, it’s 2018 and those same friends are texting you stuff like, “He proposed! I said YES!!!” or “It’s a healthy baby girl, 7 lbs, 12 ounces!” And you’re responding, “k,” because even typing out a simple “congrats” would take about twenty minutes. And you don’t have that kind of time. Because you’re at a red light. And you’ve gotta look down at the directions you printed out from MapQuest.
By which we mean: buddy, this shit ain’t cute anymore.

You don’t want to be addicted to the endless flow of information, to be rendered just another mindless zombie, walking into streetlights because you’re too engrossed in a stream of moth memes. You want to really experience the world, you say. And we get that. Except, pal: you’re on Meh right now, and you’ve read almost the entire write-up. So let’s tap the brakes before we judge how everyone else is using their time.
And don’t worry: this phone is not nice enough to make you seem suddenly materialistic.

Each year, representatives from all 50 European countries gather for the EuroSock Summit to discuss potential changes to the sock’s age-old design. Here is a summary of year’s Summit, which took place in Luxembourg in a chamber deep inside the Grand Ducal Palace:


The representative from Sweden proposed changing the design, so that the sock appeared strangely both modern yet antiquated, like a torture device, but also attractive and entirely comfortable. Motion failed to pass by a vote of 11 to 39.


The representative from Italy proposed making the next EuroSock as soft as the richest pillowy ball of burrata, as delicate to touch as the most sumptuous pluck-able leaves of basil, and yet as firm as tagliatelle cooked to a perfect al dente. Also: more garlic. Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 19 to 31.


The representative from France proposed making the sock from a distinct material that would grow delightfully crusty over night, so to it could be enjoyed the next day. There was some confusion over this, but eventually the representative from France admitted she was simply hungry, having been disappointed in her hotel’s bread options that morning at breakfast. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Norway proposed making the sock seven times thicker. When someone suggested he have multiple pairs of socks–some for summer, others for winter–he smiled and nodded, saying, “Yes, exactly! These would be for summer!” Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 3 to 47.


The representative from Ireland proposed making the socks out of a darker fabric, one “as pitch black as a Guinness.” The representative from Belgium chimed in to add that the fabric should be strong, “not unlike a delicious quadrupel.” The German representative also leaned forward to propose adding a pinch of sea salt, “one of the key ingredients in a traditional gose.” When they all three broke down laughing it became clear that they’d partaken in a few of the aforementioned beverages during the break for lunch. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Lithuania proposed shelving sock-talk for a bit. Instead, she suggested, maybe they should open some rakia, grappa, limoncello, champagne, or what have you and join their Irish, Belgian, and German compatriots, who were obviously having the best time of anybody. Motion passed by a vote of 50-0.


In this way the Summit ended, just as in previous years, and the EuroSock remained mostly unchanged."	0.05			2018-10-04T04:00:09.459Z	0.30652535328345804	0.94	60866

When I first saw that we were selling an air fryer, I was torn.
On the one hand, Wirecutter pretty emphatically stated that they don’t recommend these things for how expensive they are. If you’re not familiar with Wirecutter, they’re basically one of the best and most straightforward resources for when you’re buying kitchen appliances, electronics, and just about everything in between. They do a lot of research and provide simple, easy-to-understand articles replete with concrete purchasing recommendations. So, their opinion carries a lot of weight.
On the other hand, my dad has an air fryer and he likes it.
Two venerable sources. Two contradictory opinions. I didn’t know who to trust. So I began to dig deeper. Here’s what I found:


While working on his Wirecutter article, Michael Sullivan conducted more than 35 hours worth of air fryer tests. In the end, he was so unimpressed with them that he recommended buying a simple convection toaster oven to get a better bang for your buck.


Back when I was in high school, my dad used to change my car’s oil. Not just check it, mind you, but perform a full-blown change. He had a little pit in the garage, so you could pull your car right in and he’d take care of it every 3000 miles.


Given those two facts, I came to the following conclusion: it was possible that my dad had also used his air fryer for 35 total hours, yet it was very unlikely that Michael Sullivan had ever changed the oil in my car when I was in high school. This seemed like a pretty clear “checkmate” situation. But then I remembered that an air fryer’s greatest selling point is its oil-free frying. Thus, it only seemed fair that all oil-based arguments need be discarded. I found myself right back at square one.
Then it hit me: my dad is a Meh customer. He likely bought his air fryer right here on this very site. Meanwhile, Wirecutter suggests a model that retails at about $250, which is FIVE TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS ONE. Furthermore, they never say they’re outright bad; they just say they aren’t worth the money. Which makes sense: my dad would likely not be the satisfied air-frying customer he is today had he been required to fork over more than 200 bucks.
Therefore, Wirecutter, I know we’ve suggested this before, but if you’re reading this, consider an addendum to your initial verdict of “Not recommended”: something like, “unless it’s selling on Meh for almost a fifth of the cost, in which case, go to town.” I’d be happy to put you in touch with my dad if you need any more information."	0.05			2018-10-03T04:00:13.622Z	0.4058992852291472	0.92	65054		0.15524434813545068

In the grand scheme of things, I’m pretty smart about health stuff. No, not necessarily among other humans. I mean in the REAL grand scheme, as in: among all living creatures in the world. I sometimes eat too many donuts, or drink so much coffee that I give myself a headache. But I at least KNOW what I’ve done immediately after I’ve done it. And compared to my cats or my dog, I come out looking like a friggin’ genius!
For example, I won’t find my way into the trash and attempt to consume a giant wad of paper towels that were used to soak up frying oil, only to slink behind the couch and embarrassedly vomit it up. And if I found myself stuck in a bathroom, I would wait patiently until someone got home and ask them for some help. I would not, under any circumstances, try to EAT MY WAY OUT, causing enough damage so that both the door and the trim need to be replaced, and giving myself a pretty rough tummy ache along the way. Another point in my favor: I understand the utility of pills as well as the ease with which they can be taken. They don’t need to be hidden in cheese or loaded into a little plastic contraption to be shot deep into my throat in order to induce swallowing. I just take them!
And yet, even as I type these gloating words, I’m sitting in a rickety wooden chair, leaning awkwardly over my laptop. Unlike the damage of a few too many donuts or a bit too much coffee, I won’t feel the effects of my bad poor posture for many years. And yet, I know this, but I do nothing to correct it.
In a way, poor posture is like the human version of eating out of the garbage. We just can’t help it. Instead of taste-testing rotten meat or chewing on plastic bags, we hunch. And just as pets need help learning what they should and should not do, often for their own good, so do we.
That’s where this this Posture PT Confidence Corrector comes in. It can fit onto just about any chair–from office chairs to the driver’s seat of your car–and it improves posture, which in turn strengthens your core and reduces lower back and shoulder pain. Or, to put it differently, it’s not unlike a spray that makes bad posture smell like sour apples!
Okay, that’s going a little overboard with the pet metaphor thing. It’s not a spray. It’s a posture corrector. Sorry for the confusion. Now buy one, and straighten out your life. Got it?"	0.05			2018-10-02T04:00:03.835Z	0.31486252125742953	0.93	62431

Today’s sale leaves us conflicted. On the one hand, this would seem like an Order/Hoarder sale: you’re given options, some more reasonable than others. On the other, it’s not exactly the same as past Order/Hoarder sales we’ve offered. For example, there are more than two options. So, if you don’t mind, we thought we could work through this together, with a little Q&A:
How does the math break down?
This is a little more complicated than usual. You can get a 40 pack of basic fidget spinners for $14 ($0.35/spinner) or a 40 pack of LED fidget spinners for $16 ($0.40/spinner). But you could also get a 160 pack of both LED and basic fidget spinners (an 80 and 80 split) for $34. Which is about $0.21 per spinner… except, if you think about it: the first 40 basic spinners cost $14 and the first 40 LED spinners cost $16, which adds up to $30. So that’s a mere $4 for the last 80 fidget spinners, or a nickel per! CRAZY!
So then why wouldn’t this be an Order/Hoarder sale?
For three reasons:


As mentioned above, it’s not an either/or. There are three options.


40 fidget spinners will already have you well on your way to hoarding fidget spinners; but, more importantly…


These aren’t really for hoarding! We’re offering them now, because we want  to get them to you with plenty of time to spare before the end of the month. That way, you can offer them out to Trick Or Treaters on Halloween. That doesn’t sound very hoarderly at all, does it?


Why wouldn’t you just give candy away on Halloween like everyone else?
Because fidget spinners are fun and will last longer. Also, this site is run by someone from Saint Louis where some people give out jokes instead of chocolate, so it’s kind of on brand for us to eschew the national standard for Halloween practices.
Wait, back up: what even ARE fidget spinners?
They’re goofy little spinny toys with no real purpose other then to be fidgeted with.
That’s sorta dumb, isn’t it?
You might think so, but in a world where people try to sell peppermint-scented oil as an alternative to physical therapy, I find it refreshing that there’s a product out there that’s explicitly for useless goofings-off.

First, this is some pretty classy jerky. Therefore, the price tag isn’t going to be exactly in line with the Slim Jim that you buy on a whim as you check out at the grocery store, only to open it in your car and for the noxious smell to make you regret your decision, although not enough to stop you from eating it. Hypothetically speaking. Point is: this is good jerky and good jerky costs money.
Second, and more importantly: we need to make something EXCEEDINGLY clear. We saw @djslack’s suggestion and considered it, but the decision to sell the jerky ultimately came down to us and us alone. In fact, there’s a chance that we subconsciously were thinking about selling jerky and so @djslack didn’t exactly give us the idea as much as surface it.
What we’re saying is: we’re not necessarily in the business of outsourcing our product selection. As in, we don’t do requests. As in, don’t get used to this, okay? Because this is it. The party ends here.
We say this because ever since we sold some toothbrushes as a joke–that’s right, it was a joke! A joke ON YOU!–we know there have been rumblings on the forums about something you’d like us to sell. That’s how obstinate we are, people: we won’t even name the item. We won’t even write the word. Because we are unmovable.
We’re like a brick wall. People always tell us that. They say, “Talking to you all is like talking to a brick wall.” Which we take as a compliment concerning our strength. And also our attractiveness, given that brick is a very beautiful building material. In certain cases, at least. Maybe not in some of the suburban architecture of the mid-fifties. But then again, those homes have a certain nostalgic beauty in a way. There’s a pure American warmth to them, isn’t there?

Thus, in order to know what the site is, all you’ll need to do is follow a wide variety of publications that cover the following: computers, electronics, kitchen appliances, vacuums, cameras, photography, automotive innovations, home and garden, just home, just garden, cellular accessories, flashlights, salt lamps, culinary interests, pillows, snacks, fashion, lawn maintenance, DIY home improvement, carpentry, wiring, construction, cameras again, etc. That way, you’ll see our press release announcing our new venture. As well as new hires.
Because we would essentially need to build an entirely new team, wouldn’t we? Otherwise, it’d just be a gimmick. And besides, I don’t want a flashlight expert telling me about trowels or copper pans or robot vacuum cleaners. No, we’d have to start from scratch every day. And in the event that something sells out, we’d probably have to have another site. A site of nothing. A sort of meditative anti-consumerism zen space with no purpose aside the absence of all shopping. Which would also need a whole new staff. That would need to be hired midday and let go by the next morning…
Okay, you know what, we’re going to take these thoughts back to the idea room and think this through a bit further. In the meantime, what you can do to help is buy some flashlights!"	0.05			2018-09-28T04:00:10.030Z	0.31179265788250815	0.94	69975

Dearest Professor Alba,
First off, a hearty congratulations on winning the Henning Prize. Your self-adhering bow-tie is certainly a masterwork, and the award is absolutely deserved. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the ceremony. As I am sure you are aware, since my expulsion, you are my sole correspondent from the Meyer Institute of Alchemic Fashion. But my choice not to attend is not due to some fear of seeing my former classmates and teachers again–or, more accurately, of experiencing their fear as they witness me. No, I cannot attend because I have fallen ill, and I fear this may be the last letter I ever write.
Although, perhaps ‘fallen ill’ is a simplification, as the illness under which I suffer has no name.
The trouble began in my makeshift lab late one night. I was working on a new stitch technique, making minor tweaks to it here and there over the course of several weeks. It was going nowhere, and after one particularly long day toiling in the haberdashery (with no Meyer Certification, I am forced to do such menial labor), I came home so exhausted and angry that I decided to throw it all away in favor of something entirely new.
I am sure you will be disappointed to hear this. During my expulsion hearings, you were the strongest voice in my favor. When the administration said that I “endangered” all those around me with the “diabolical recklessness” of my work, you told them it was just a phase. But Professor Alba, it was not. And while I am not proud to admit that, I am also not exactly not proud either.
For that evening, in my lab, I created something amazing: a stitch unlike any other stitch; a stitch that seemed to take time into it, that seemed to steal tiny slivers of the universe’s fabric and convert them into pure style. It was a stitch that resembled a stitch in only an ethereal way, like a word in another language whose definition we can on some level understand but for which there is no direct translation. I sewed up some pairs of socks with the stitch; despite using bland monochrome fabrics, each pair came out patterned with a bold unpredictable design.
I learned all too late that it was taking something from me as well, that it was essentially draining my life energy, weaving it among each sock’s seams. I fashioned a lead coat to wear while working, but it was too late. The damage has been done. I write this letter to you from bed, Professor Alba, a bed from which I fear I may never again rise. Indeed, just the act of writing has left me pale and exhausted.
But this is not a letter merely bidding farewell to you and this world. You will find, in the envelope, the detailed plans for the aforementioned stitch (as well as for the protective coat). I cannot say what I want for you to do with them. Some days I hope you will set them aflame and think of them no more; other days I hope you will use them to start a line of vibrant and delightful socks to sell around the world.
But, Professor Alba, promise me this: if you choose the latter, make sure to warn the people, to let them know the truth, that these are not simply stitched socks.
With Eternal Gratitude,

Step 2: Apply ass to chair. (Optional, recline chair or use ottoman to extend legs).
Step 3: Apply blanket to lap and/or legs.
Step 4: Apply purring cat to blanket at lap area. Pet cat occasionally.
Step 5: Apply hand to remote; locate a binge-worthy show on your television; press play.
Step 6: When your significant other or roommate enters the room and asks if you’re really going to spend all day just sitting there watching television, sigh and say, “You’re right,” then move (very slightly) to get up, stopping only to hiss with pain and grasp at the injury area where the first aid was administered. (Optional: parlay sympathy, if shown, into your significant other or roommate bringing you a hot beverage of your choice: coffee, tea, cocoa, or apple cider.)
Step 7: When your significant other or roommate leaves the room, replace purring cat (if riled by your attempt to get up), rewind show as needed, and resume viewing.

Overview: Very good, but not as good as Michael Keaton!!!
Before I get into my review, I want to give you a little bit of background: I’m a huge Michael Keaton fan and a software developer. Recently, I sold my start-up to a large tech conglomerate for several million dollars. I used that money to build a bunker inside an abandoned warehouse where I would live and wait for Michael Keaton to arrive so I can ask him a few continuity-related questions about his seminal 1996 comedy, Multiplicity, for my podcast: The Podkeast. I won’t list the questions here because I am certain they’ve never been asked and I want to be sure I’m the ones who asks them (more on this below, when I get into the complaints).
I need peace in my bunker to record episodes of The Podkeast and also to meditate and prepare myself for the eventual interview. Luckily, it’s soundproof. That brought up another issue, though: if I can’t hear anything, how will I know when Mike (that’s what I call him in my head sometimes) has arrived?
That’s where The Lynx 1080P Camera comes in! The quality’s great, they’re easy to set up, there’s free cloud storage, and most importantly, it has facial recognition. Using photos, I trained mine to only recognize one face: Michael Keaton’s. Thus, I’ll get a check-in notification whenever he arrives (fingers crossed, any day now!). Any other unfamiliar face alerts that come through I just ignore, because like I said, I don’t need the distractions.
I should say: I do have two complaints. One is that the Lynx recognizes faces really well, but not always the material said faces are made of. What I’m getting at is that my mom keeps showing up in a really realistic Michael Keaton mask (she probably bought it with the start-up money I gave her, ugh!). She always says the same thing: that she’s worried I might be losing my mind. It makes me want to scream. Like, of course I’m losing my mind! I got a check-in notification and thought Michael Friggin’ Keaton was here! And sometimes I do scream. Hey, it’s a sound-proof bunker, gotta get your money’s worth, right?
The other complaint I have is that Michael Keaton has not shown up to do the interview with me. This is probably more a don’t-have-Michael-Keaton’s-contact-info problem than a Lynx problem, but still: with that AND the mask issue, I didn’t feel right giving it five stars.

When it comes to celebrating milestones, different people demand different amounts of ceremony. Some will require you to wear tuxedos and dinner gowns to the their wedding in a restored factory-turned-theater-space, wherein they will prepare a choreographed song and dance commemorating the various defining moments of their relationship. Others will go to the courthouse, sign a few documents, and send a text imploring you to meet them for beers later.
Whether it be a birthday, a successful defense of a PhD dissertation, or a housewarming party–everyone’s a little different. Not everyone wants gifts. But herein lies the one consistent rule, regardless of an event’s formality: if you’re bringing a gift, you have to put it in something festive. Because even the most casual soon-to-be mom isn’t going to stoked when you show up with a onesie still in the shipping box from VintageOnsiesRUs․com.
The problem? Wrapping is stressful. Wrap a gift poorly and you look like a degenerate. Wrap a gift too ornately and you seem like a bit of an over-achiever. Besides, not everything is easy to wrap. If you want to wrap an overstuffed plush starfish, you can either a) put it in a box and wrap that, or b) get your friend who’s an aerospace engineer to help you get the measurements and scissor placement just right so that it doesn’t come out looking like garbage.
Really, your best bet is to put that overstuffed plush starfish into a gift bag. Because the gift bag always looks good. It’s as fun-looking as wrapping paper and as easy as a shipping box. Plus, getting a gift in a gift bag rules. You’re basically getting two gifts, one of which you’re more than encouraged to regift later when you need to give someone else a gift.

You’ll notice that you have two choices on today’s sale. One is reasonable. The other is unreasonable. Or should we say: the other is an UNREASONABLY GOOD DEAL! You know what that means. It’s the return of:
ORDER/HOARDER
For those are unfamiliar, Order/Hoarder is when we offer you two options: a normal number of things for a good price, or an abnormally large number of things for a GREAT price. Today’s product:
Cooling towels!!!
So, let’s break it down:
The Math
“You can’t put a price on cool.” That’s something someone said in a movie once. It doesn’t matter who or what movie or if I just made it up, because it’s not true. You can put a price on being cool.
For example, if you just want to be double-cool (as in, get two cooling towels) you have to pay $12. That comes down to the totally reasonable per towel price of $6 (especially considering they’re $10 over on Amazon).
Now, here’s where it gets a bit more complicated. As we like to point out on these sales, when figuring out the price per unit of the Hoarder order, it’s not as simple as dividing the overall price ($36) by the number of units (12). BECAUSE, your can choose either 2 or 12, no in-betweens. Therefore, if you think about it, you’re already paying $6 for each of the first 2 towels, which means the last 10 towels are only costing you $24, or a mere $2.40 per towel! How about that deal, huh?!
What you can do with a normal order
It’s pretty simple. Cooling towels are not exactly all that, well, cool, but they are functional. With just two of them, you can use one as your main post-workout cool-down towel, and give the other to your spouse or partner. Or you can cycle through both yourself so you don’t have to do laundry as often.
What can you do with a Hoarder order
So much more! Here are just a few suggestions:


Go a day early and leave a cooling towel at each mile marker of your upcoming 20K race, so you never have to worry about getting too hot.


Take all of them and fashion them into a suit or cocktail dress to wear to outdoor weddings. But would a suit or dress made out of cooling towels really be classy enough for something like that? you might ask. To which we would respond: Could it be any less classy than a suit or dress soaked with sweat?


Sure, you could spend a bunch of money on an air conditioner and then a bunch of more money each month to run it. Or, you could save some cash by sewing yourself a delightful cooling towel quilt!


They’d make a great napkin alternative at your 12-guest “super spicy food banquet”.


Are you a do-gooder teen? Do you often dream of fashioning rope ladders out of clothes and blankets to lower yourself out your 2nd story bedroom window so you can run around after bedtime with your new rebellious friends? Only, your palms get so sweaty that you can’t get a good grip? Gosh, if only you could make a rope ladder out of something cool and soothing to the touch!


See? Maybe we were wrong. Maybe 12 cooling towels isn’t an unreasonable amount of cooling towels at all. On the other hand, you still have the option of buying the (completely boring) 2-pack. The decision is yours!

Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a child. Let’s call him @Dave. Dave wore Sears-brand Toughskin jeans. They were, as their name implied, durable and long-lasting. But, like most economically practical things, corners needed to be cut to keep them affordable, and, unfortunately for Dave, the corner Toughskin jeans cut was the let’s-make-these-things-look-cool corner.
Or maybe not unfortunately. Because Dave rarely felt self-conscious in his Toughskin jeans. What did make him feel self-conscious was when, in the mid-80s, his grandparents splurged and got him a Generra sweatshirt. It was “in.” Very “in.” In fact, you could say that it was so deeply “in” that the brand couldn’t find its way out of the decade.
Suddenly, all the other kids at school were stopping Dave in the hallway to say, “Cool sweatshirt,” and, after years of remaining invisible behind the Toughskin curtain, he didn’t know how to react to such a compliment. It was uncomfortable.
Dave has come a long way since then… or has he? No, he doesn’t wear Toughskin jeans anymore, but he still has a Toughskin mindset. He’s not afraid of bright purple laptops or speakers that are loud in both function and design. This, in some ways, is his calling: espousing the virtues of things that don’t look exactly like you’d hope but work just fine.
But he doesn’t exactly know what to do with these slick-looking Rowkin Bluetooth Ear Buds.
Does he say: just because Meh sells some stuff that has substance but lacks style does NOT mean the stylish stuff we sell lacks substance in equal measure? Does he point out that many of the negative reviews on Amazon that have driven the average rating down to an unimpressive 3 stars can be put into 3 categories:

people complaining about the hefty (non-Meh) price tag;
people who struggled with a weird issue that was corrected easily by a factory reset; and

As we’ve mentioned before, we recently won an auction for a storage locker that was filled entirely with branded content romance novels. Or so we thought. But, picking through the titles, we actually found many belonged to a branded content epic fantasy series by the author L.L.R. Holdien about a warrior named Tarklaw The Powerful. Luckily for us, there’s a chapter in book 19 about today’s product, the Keysmart (and Keysmart Pro).

Having successfully freed the shape-shifting wizard Vintel, son of Filor The Great, from the floating prison of Delkabana, narrowly escaping the light-spears of the Meschlen Guards by leaping through a portal leading somewhere that only a seer like Wise Crin might intuit–Tarklaw found himself deposited into murky waist-high water.
“Vintel?” Tarklaw called out, trying to locate the wizard whom he had just a moment ago saved, despite their families’ centuries-long acrimonious relations.
“I’m right here, Tarklaw,” Vintel seemed to whisper into his ear, buzzingly. “As a shape-shifting wizard, it is my custom to acclimate my shape to the environs, and so I have taken the form a mosquito because we, bitter-family-enemy-turned-savior, appear to be in a swamp.”
“Not just any swamp! The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors!” came a voice that belonged neither to Tarklaw or Vintel, but another in their vicinity. Tarklaw turned quickly, drawing his great sword with a shing sound common of sword-drawing. But he found only a small creature not unlike an unshelled tortoise, swimming towards them. “Forgive me for startling you! I am Rewn, peaceful leader of the Melorians, the primary inhabitants of this swamp at the edge of the Planet Glor at the far reaches of the Heplan Galaxy. Now, I imagine you’ve come here through some pesky portal or other, but fear not: your exit is easily made through one of the Eight Astounding Doors.”
“Doors?” Said Tarklaw. “I am from the planet Phentalon, a place without doors, due to our peoples’ openness with each other.”
“Very noble,” Rewn said. “Perhaps one day, The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors shall be like that. For now, you must choose one. They go to any number of worlds, from the euphorically beautiful mountain-scape of Relan to the hellish fire-deserts of Dumask. And we have all the keys right here…” Rewn dipped under the water for a moment, but re-emerged with a perplexed look upon his creaturely face. “Oh, dear! They were right there a moment ago.”
“You simply allow all keys to be strewn throughout a swamp?” buzzed Vintel.
“Not exactly,” Rewn said, explanatorily. “We keep them all together using an ingenious contraption known as a KeySmart. Made of aircraft aluminum, it can hold eight keys–or as many as fourteen, with an expansion pack! Additionally, it includes a loop for keys belonging to vehicles propelled by motors. Not to mention, its extended frame can hold long or foreign keys, which is especially important to us, as one of our oldest and most prized keys is made from the hollow bird-like finger bone of the fallen Hilderan Mage Lazlorn.”
“But,” Vintel buzzed, contrarily, “as ingenious and organizationally optimized as that all sounds, it seems at present not to be helping in your ability to locate them.”
“Ah, yes, that would be true if it were the base model, which is still good,” Rewn said. “Luckily for us, we opted for the Pro. Not only does it have a built-in LED flashlight and bottle opener; it can also show a map of your missing keys, and by way of the Tile app–which can be accessed via your smartphone or tablet–you can make your keys ring out loud! Of course, I should add at this juncture that the ‘water’ here in the The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors is different in elemental makeup to that of the water on other planets, such as Earth.”
“Are you saying,” Vintel buzzed, clarifyingly, “that just because we are discussing the KeySmart Pro being used in a water-based situation, it should not be taken as an endorsement of it being waterproof?”
“Exactly,” cried Rewn, disclaimingly.
“Much like doors, smartphones and tablets are concepts foreign to my home world,” Tarklaw said. “But that sounds like a great functional product nonetheless.”
“And I will show you just how functional it is!” Rewn cried with excitement. He brought forward a device and opened the Tile app. A moment later, a ding rang out, though it sounded muffled. The three of them turned… and stood facing a giant glowing snake-like beast. It emerged from the water, standing nearly forty Glorian theltans tall, or forty feet tall in Earth measurements, Glorian theltans being exactly equal to terrestrial feet. The ding sounded again, from somewhere deep inside of the monster’s abdomen.
“Oh no! A Mirelord! Run!” Rewn cried with fear. “Or, better yet, swim.” And with that, he disappeared under the water.
But Tarklaw did not swim away. He crouched into a combat ready position as best he could in the deep murky water. The Mirelord leaned closer to him, its eyes alight with evil.
“What are you doing?” buzzed Vintel into his ear, questioningly.
“We must get out of this swamp,” Tarklaw cried. “This is the only way. Though, it will be hard for just the two of us to defeat it…”
“Perhaps, I can help?” came a distinguished voice from Tarklaw’s side.
Tarklaw turned, and saw… no! He couldn’t believe it! “Hinton, son of Raquille, wielder of The Great Axe Of Orlagos, and best friend since birth of Tarklaw The Powerful? But I thought you were–”
“The immortal prisoner of the Inter-dimensional Pirate Lop, locked away in the his ship, The Pummeling Ewlok, for all of eternity?” Hinton laughed. “Not a chance in Dumask, my friend! Now, what do you say we free the aforementioned product from the belly of the beast? Just like old times?”
Tarklaw couldn’t help but smile. “Just like old times, indeed,” he said, and they raised their weapons to the approaching Mirelord."	0.05			2018-09-19T04:00:10.856Z	0.34612555704581827	0.93	72268

One time, I left without remembering to close the door.
I was living in a house somewhere so rural we didn’t need to lock up, and, in a rush to leave (I was going on a trip), I forgot to swing the door all the way closed, leaving only the screen door between my cat and freedom. He was fine. My mom checked on him the next day and, much to her surprise, he emerged from under the deck after spending what must’ve been, for an indoor cat, a terrifying night outside.
Just about every time I have left the house since then, even if just for an hour, I have wondered: “did I close the door? Did I lock the door? Do the pets have food? Do they have water? Did I leave the oven on? Did I unconsciously light seven candles and place them precariously close to window curtains that are, unbeknownst to me, highly flammable?” Many times, I have gone back to check. Never have I left the stove on. Never have I found candles flickering. The pets have always been fine. Only once or twice have I found the door unlocked.
Still, I never regret it, because it’s nicer to know everything’s fine than it is to hope everything’s fine.
And that’s really what these Zmodo MeShare cameras are for: making sure. You can call them “security cameras,” but that feels a little overstated. Maybe it would be better to rebrand them as “check-in cameras.” After all, the chances that you’re going to tune in as your home is being burglarized–thus allowing you to call the authorities while the burglary is in progress–is very low. I mean, hell, the actual likeliness of your home being burglarized at all is very low. And if your first thought upon reading that is, Nuh-uh, my home gets broken into all the time, we won’t argue with you. But we will say: you probably need more than a couple Zmodos.
Otherwise, these are a good option for the second-guessers out there to quell all the concerns that might flare up during your day at work: whether you just want to make sure everything’s fine, or to check that you didn’t forget to close the windows, or to monitor whether your dog is feeling okay after eating something stupid that he wasn’t supposed to…

The second thing you need to know is that the backs velcro on, and the seats have magnets in them, which makes them “infinitely configurable.” And yet, if that’s the case, then why is are these proposed layouts so BORING?! They’re mostly just couches. Where’s the fun in that? Why not try something more exciting, like these three designs:
You’re Number One

Will anyone even see that it’s a #1? Probably not. Is it really a practical way to lay out a room? No. But the subliminal reassurance that the design will provide for your child is massive. Every time they sit down they’ll think, “Hey, you know what: I’m special!” And this confidence will push them to do great things.
Game Room

Checkers is simple and boring on a board… but what about in a room, with you and all of your friends as the pieces? To make it more exciting: institute a rule where it’s not as easy as just “jumping” another piece; instead, you have to battle for it. Whoever doesn’t get cast into one of the empty spaces (i.e. onto the floor) wins!
Soft Kitchen

Okay, this isn’t exactly innovative, design-wise. But in terms of utility? Think about it: you cover the floor of your kitchen, wall-to-wall, with Sactionals, and now, suddenly, you can drop a glass or a ceramic mug and it won’t shatter! Plus, they’re machine washable, in case there’s a spill. Best of all, if you need to keep an eye on something you’ve got baking, you can just lay down next to the oven and watch it!

Dear @reclaimercube,
On September 2nd, you posted the following comment on a knife sale:

Meh I have anxiously been awaiting for you to post a toothbrush for sale again. I will post this everyday until you finally sell another one again.

And, @reclaimercube, can we tell you something? We’re very proud of you. Because you kept your word. Since then, each day, you’ve put forward this same request.
Your fellow Meh customers began to notice. One post from Friday, September 7th sparked a discussion that involved more than 20 comments. In that conversation, someone pointed out a toothbrush for sale on a competitor’s site. You, ever strong, refused to take the bait:

not a bad deal… But not on meh so it doesn’t matter. You could link me to colgate’s website or crest’s website for a free toothbrush and I still wouldn’t want it unless it was on meh. I’m chaining myself to this statue. Ride or die mehbrother.

Your repeated request did not specify why you wanted a toothbrush, or what kind of toothbrush you wanted. Really, you haven’t even promised that you’d buy the toothbrush. You’ve only asked, repeatedly, for us to “post a toothbrush.”
Well, good news, @reclaimercube: when we launched Meh, we made a decision. Once, and only once, we would allow a Meh customer to dictate exactly what we’d sell. The only rule was they had to make the request for 13 consecutive days. They could ask for $1 MacBooks, or free puppies, or Cadillac Escalades filled with cash. It didn’t matter. There were no restrictions, aside from the 13 days. Some of us worried the financial hit would be too much, but others felt assured: we could trust our customers! They wouldn’t make unreasonable demands!
So thank you, @reclaimercube; you’ve shown us that our faith was not misplaced. Now, Meh community, let’s all come together and celebrate with this build-your-own-bundle of toothbrushes.
Sincerely,
Meh

Hair: it is the ultimate example of disobedience.
You can train puppies to pee outside, to walk next to you, to sit, to shake, to do any number of fun and/or useful things. With cats, the job is much harder, but with some persistence (and a spray bottle) it is possible to enforce a few rules: you do not yowl in the middle of the night, you do not walk on the kitchen counter, you do not knock our decorative trinkets off the mantle as a game. Even a bonsai can be coaxed, over time, to grow a certain way.
But not hair. Nope, no matter how many times you comb, shave, style, epilate, and wax: it can just never take the fucking hint!
You know that person in your  your life who’s like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “hmm, maybe?” And you hope they’ll just drop it, but then a day later, they’re like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “I don’t know if that dumb thing is really a good idea.” Which should be clear as hell, but they don’t want to listen, so they keep prodding and prodding until you’re like, “Look,  I don’t want to do the dumb thing because it is dumb, and honestly, I’m worried you might be dumb for suggesting it, and I might be dumb for being the friend of such a dumb person.” And you feel terrible but they just smile and say, “C’mon! It’ll be great!”
That’s hair. No matter how many times you try to send the message that you don’t want it to come back there, it keeps coming back there. It is untrainable!
Or is that the wrong way to look at it? Could it be that we are the untrainable ones? That our hair is not being a stubborn learner but a tenacious teacher? That it wants to lead us to a better place? A place where we eschew the standards of beauty thrust upon us? Because isn’t it pretty arbitrary where we say there should be hair and where we say there should not? On the head is good, but not on the face? Except some faces capable of growing thick enough hair? On the chest is okay, but no, never on the back? Not on the legs, but okay on the arms, except in the armpits? Could it be that our hair’s persistence is its way of saying: you need to get the hell over it and just be who you are?

The three brothers had been cleaning out their grandfather’s basement for nearly two hours before they found the FoodSaver.
“What’s this?” said Kyle, holding it up.
“Looks old,” said Jake. “I’d guess circa second half of the 2010’s.”
Terry took it from Kyle and inspected it. “Wait, I know these things. It’s an early model weed-sealer. You know? The devices for vacuum-packing weed so it wouldn’t go bad.”
“All this talk of weed remind me, have you guys taken your three o’clock edibles yet?” Jake asked.
Kyle and Terry nodded.
“But wait,” Kyle said, “why does it say FoodSaver on it, if it’s for weed?”
“You have to understand, Kyle, this was before weed was legal everywhere,” Terry explained. “They didn’t even put it in the water back then!”
Kyle looked at the FoodSaver perplexed. “Really?”
“I’m serious,” Terry said. “So people weren’t as acclimated to it as we are now. They considered it a drug. Thus, when people took some, they got ‘high,’ which basically meant they thought without logic. So it’s likely that the inventor of the ‘FoodSaver’ only named it such because he was super high, and probably pretty hungry.”
“So strange to think that the same substance that keeps us calm and measured, used to have almost the opposite effect!” Kyle said.
Now Jake had the FoodSaver. “Are you sure this is a weed-sealer? To me, it looks like an early sous-vide-assistant. That would make more sense with the FoodSaver name.”
“Did they even sous vide back then?” Terry asked.
“Sure,” Jake said. “It was more of a luxury, though, given that it was before the Microwave And Oven Act of 2035.”
“When I read about those times, and all the negative-energy-pollution caused by those now illegal kitchen appliances, it just makes me sick,” Terry said.
“Guys, you’ve got me thinking…” Kyle paused to gather his thoughts. “Well, you know how when we put stuff in the freezer, it just freezes together and gets covered in weird ice?”
“They’re called water diamonds, Kyle,” Terry said.
“They mean the moisture has accepted the food, so we know it’s safe to eat,” Jake said.
“I’m well aware of them and what they mean. Don’t forget, I’m the one who studied health at Dove For Men Presents: College. But I was thinking, the food doesn’t always taste good after the water diamonds form.” Kyle took the FoodSaver from Jake. “And I know this is going to sound crazy, but if this thing could keep weed fresh, and be used with food products for sous-vide purposes, maybe we could combine the two functions. Like, we could use it to seal food before we freeze it so it stays fresher longer.”
“You mean, you want to eat food that’s been frozen but hasn’t emitted its proper water diamonds?” Terry said.
“Isn’t that illegal?” Jake added.
“Sure, on Earth. But not here,” Kyle said, “on Mars.”
Jake and Terry had to admit he had a point: they definitely had been on Mars this whole time."	0.05			2018-09-13T04:00:05.184Z	0.21097046413502127	0.92	62121

As someone who doesn’t brush his hair much, Wet Brushes look, to me, like normal brushes. But looks can be deceiving. Or, in this case, the looks are deceivingly simple.

The Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet is pretty simple: it’s a wallet that comes with a powerpack, which can be used to charge your phone or other devices.
In a way, to recharge something is to refill it, but unfortunately, while the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet does fill your wallet in the literal sense–like, there is a powerpack inside of it–it can’t refill your wallet in the figurative sense–as in, recharge your bank account.
Or can it?
Because think about this: what kind of phone is the most likely to have a short battery life? An old phone! And maybe you have an upgrade waiting for you, but you don’t want to dish out the money for one. Because maybe, with your provider, it’s not as simple as handing over $200 and getting a new iPhone. Now, you pay for the upgrade via a small increase in your monthly bill–a small increase that over time accumulates into a lot of money. And it’s very possible that this change was made because people like you: people who buy a phone and then ride it into the ground, thus spending a couple hundred bucks every six years, rather than evert two like your cell company–let’s call them Werizon–would prefer.
And so now you’ve got a geriatric phone that needs a pick-me-up every few hours to make it through the day, and you’re not always near an outlet, so one of these Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallets–‘wallets’ plural because you get a 2-pack–is just what you need. It’s your wallet, so it’s not like you’ll forget it. Thus, you’ll always have some charge on hand, which means you don’t need to upgrade, which means your phone bill won’t go up, which means you’ll save money, which, in conclusion, means the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet can, in fact, recharge both your phone and your wallet!

I remember being a kid, riding in my parents’ car at night, and dropping something. Maybe a toy or a quarter. It doesn’t matter what. What matters is I reached up and turned on the dome light to find the object in question. And it was then that my dad freaked the fuck out. You would’ve thought I’d tossed hot acid in his eyes. “Turn that off! I can’t see anything!” he claimed. He might’ve even swerved a little, for emphasis. As a dutiful child, I switched the light off as quickly as possible to avoid careening off the road into a ditch.
Flash forward some years: I have a license. I have a car. A friend is riding with me. He turns on the dome light for something and… everything is fine.
The same thing happened the first time I helped jumpstart a car. I’d been told so many times about everything that can go terribly wrong that I felt sure that it would end in a) an deadly storm of electricity and fire; or b) one or both of the cars being fried for good. Turns out, if you, ya know, just follow instructions, it works out fine.
If anything, the greatest risk of jumping a car–the one that no amount of how-to articles or Youtube videos can save you from–is the risk of wasting a favor. Because think about it: you spend all that time being a good friend and building up positive equity until you’ve almost got enough to cash in for pet care or help shlepping some furniture from your old apartment to your new one… Then your car battery farts out and now your buddy is driving over in the cold to help you get it started again.
That’s where this iJoy Jump Starter Kit comes in. Not only will it charge your phone and provide some you with some light; it’ll make it so that you don’t need to dip into the favor bank just to get your car running.

Another super villain attacking the city, another mad rush downtown. We newspaper photographers are the real heroes, Roy thought to himself with a chuckle as he ran from the Gazette office into the mayhem, clutching his camera to his chest.
It was a joke, of course. Roy didn’t think he was more heroic than the Scarlet Savior. But he could relate to her in one way: like her, he never had any help. After layoffs there were just two of them in the photography department; they outsourced the rest. And it just so happened that whenever disaster struck, Lorraine was rushing off to take care of “a personal issue.”
What a coincidence, Roy thought. Always trying to get out of work! Then something else occurred to him: was it possible that Lorraine was, in fact, the alter ego of–
A taxi honked at Roy as he sprinted across the street toward the sounds of lasers and maniacal laughter a few blocks away. “Watch where you’re going buddy!” the diver yelled.
“I’m working!” Roy yelled back.
“Yeah, yeah,” the driver said. “Well, we’re all working too. Working on staying alive in this damn city!”
Roy laughed. Not at the man but at the theory the honk had charitably eradicated from his mind. Lorraine couldn’t be the Scarlet Savior. Sure, they both had striking red hair, but the Scarlet Savior always wore a matching Treasure Island jewelry set–one necklace, one bracelet, both made out of genuine gemstones and pearls–whereas Lorraine wore a single longer Treasure Island necklace, which was also made of genuine gemstones and pearls.
Well, that settles that! Roy thought. And just in time too! Because here she came, the Scarlet Savior, flying through the sky, blazing a red path through the sky that, strangely, looked like it originated on the roof of the Gazette’s offices.

We’re dropping the price of both but not by the same amount: for the one with multiple zippers, the price will be just a buck lower, whereas, the single-zipper version will be a whopping $5 less than last time. For those keeping score at home: that’s now a $9 difference between the two.
In some ways, this isn’t simply a sale; it’s an experiment. We want to answer the question: what is a zipper truly worth?

There are three potential outcomes to buying this Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk:
Outcome 1
You buy the standing desk. You’re intrigued by its promises of a stronger core, healthier circulation, improved productivity, and better posture. But the truth is, you don’t care for it. You’ve spent your entire life believing that getting work done requires sitting down and shutting up. So how do you expect, as an adult, to change your working position? Maybe if you gave it more time… but you don’t want to. You just want to use it as a normal desk. And that’s fine! Because this thing didn’t cost north of $600 like some models out there; it cost less than $200. And look, that’s not nothing, but it was a worthwhile gamble.
Outcome 2
You love your new standing desk. But it’s not enough. Once you taste the thrill of working upright, you want more. You quickly replace your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk with a treadmill desk. You start out walking, but soon enough you’re outright sprinting while you manage your spreadsheets and respond to emails. You get a kiddy pool and set it up behind the treadmill, filling it with a medley of pirañas and water moccasins. Now, any slowdown and you’re in trouble. But even that’s not enough. You take out the water moccasins, extract their venom, and put it in an IV that runs directly into your arm. The anti-venom is in another IV that you’ve rigged to only administer as you meet your hourly sales goals. Your friends and family members are worried about you, but you’ve never felt more alive! And it all started with the Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk!
Outcome 3
You get your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk, and you like it. You crank it up to standing height for a few hours of the day; for the rest of the time, you use it as a normal desk. You’re neither disappointed, nor unsatisfied. It meets your needs, and you will use it for the foreseeable future.

Shaving is the blandest and yet most grueling task of every personal grooming regimen. It is a zero sum game: you can put it off, but that only means it’ll be a longer and more grueling process when eventually you do get around to it. It’s like mowing the lawn, except without the exercise, and the smell of fresh cut grass replaced by the noxious chemical odor of shave gel. In short, it’s miserable.
Or it was. Until now. Enter these “Famous Maker” razors. Famous Maker? you say. But who IS the famous maker? That’s just the thing, we can’t tell you. And now suddenly, shaving is an act of immeasurable mystery and excitement!
Could it be that these razors are the excess produced by an underground razor factory located far below Park City? Perhaps for the original purpose of being distributed, in secret, to the agents and publicists and personal assistants of actors in town for the Sundance Film Festival? So that these various agents and publicists and assistants could sneak into the actors’ hotel rooms at night and shave their faces clean while they slept? Because maybe the actors, having escaped the always-on environs of Los Angeles, wanted to let themselves go, but the various men and women whose livelihoods relied on their pristine image had other things in mind?
Or could it be that the razors are from a different hidden factory, a facility built into the side of one of the Alps? For a baron? A baron who volunteered to host the worldwide beard and mustache contest at his expansive villa? While harboring a secret hatred of all facial hair? And so the plan was not to celebrate these growers of elaborate beards and mustaches, but to trap them and then use the razors to, as the baron said in a private correspondence, “reveal their cheeks upper lips once again to the world”? Maybe he even wanted to shave the hair on their head too, just to prove a point? Only his scheme was discovered by the lowly helper-boy tasked with taking his correspondence to the post office? And so the baron had no choice but to sell off his stock of razors in an effort to cut (pun intended) his losses?
Or could it be a pretty basic story of a razor company having some leftover razors that they wanted to offload? Only they couldn’t do so under their own name? Because then people would be like, “but wait, I just spent this much on these at the store, but now you’re selling them for cheap online? That’s bullshit!”?
Okay, for purposes of whimsy, let’s just ignore that last scenario. Instead, focus on the first two, buy these razors, and shave with an entirely new sense of intrigue!"	0.05			2018-09-05T04:00:15.298Z	0.26119278036366067	0.93	62903

Can I level with you here: I’m just not much a knife guy. I have a set of good kitchen knives and that’s about it. I open boxes with my keys cut through frustrating packaging with a pair of scissors. I don’t mean any judgment. I’m just being honest. The problem is, I have to write about this knife, and I can’t just say, “Uh, I don’t know? It’s fine, probably?”
Or so I thought…
Then I went to do some research on Amazon and saw a question about what material was used to make the pivot washers and how thick the blade is. The first answer reads as follows:

Sorry, this was a gift for someone in Arizona so I can’t answer your question. I can only say that the knife is substantial!

Wait, seriously? This is allowed? Admitting that you don’t know the answer… counts as an answer?! Well then friends, I’ve got some great news: I can answer all the questions you have about this 2-Pack of C.R.K.T. Ruger Go-N-Heavy Compact VEFF Serrated Knives! Let’s do it!
So, how thick is the blade?
Great question! I’d guess that it’s probably about the same as other knives like it, although it could be thicker. But even then, it wouldn’t be too much thicker, because that would be weird, right?
I’m reading that it has a “stonewashed drop-point blade.” That sounds intense. What kind of stuff can you use it for?
I bet it would be pretty good at cutting through most stuff you’d use a knife like this for, but I don’t feel comfortable naming specific stuff because I’ve never used one. I will say this, though: there’s a good chance it can cut through butter. And an even better chance if the butter has been left out of the fridge for a little while.
Was it designed by Bill Harsey?
Sure was! As to who Bill Haresay is, lol, idk! I would venture to guess he does something in the knife industry.
One reviewer says that it is 11.8"" long when it’s extended. Is that longer than other knives?
Not sure. It is definitely not as long as a foot, because a foot is 12"". With that being said, another reviewer posted a photo of it next to another knife and a tape measurer, if that helps. It is bigger than the other knife, but not the tape measurer (which is good, because those things can get really long).
Wow! This is so easy! It’s great to finally realize how much a knife expert I really am! Thanks Amazon question answerer, for showing me the way.

This Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble may seem simple enough. It’s 6 100% ceramic products with matching designs: a toothbrush holder, a tumbler, a soap dish, a lotion dispenser, a tissue box, and a trash bin. None of these things require much explanation. What does deserve some attention, though, is the multi-stage process that one goes through when deciding to buy one or all of them. We’ve laid it out below:
Stage 1: Intrigue
These are interesting. The various pieces look stylish, and they all match. It might be nice to have a motif that really brings the entire bathroom together.
Stage 2: Skepticism
But do I really need any of these? The old coffee mug we put the toothbrushes in works just fine, as does the little wicker basket we’ve got for trash. The sink already has a built-in soap dish. This one would be easier to clean, but do you really need to clean something when all it does is hold soap? Isn’t soap itself essentially the concept of cleanliness made solid? Lotion bottles already come with a pump top and tissue boxes are their own tissue dispensers, really. Am I supposed to re-package things? Isn’t that adding unnecessary steps?
Stage 3: Re-evaluation
Yes, I guess technically it is adding unnecessary steps, but all in the service of style. And maybe that’s worth it. Which would maybe mean the steps aren’t unnecessary?
*Stage 4: Introspection
And what does it say about me that I’m so put off by these objectively simple tasks? Like, it isn’t hard to empty some lotion from one thing into another thing. It isn’t hard to put a box of tissues inside another box. Or clean a soap dish. Just like it isn’t hard to put a new bag in the garbage after I take the trash out. But I never do, not right away at least. I always wait hours, sometimes even a whole day, leaving paper towels and granola bar wrappers on the kitchen counter, until finally my desire for a clean surface outweighs my laziness. At which point I put a new bag in the garbage can and am reminded that the laziness was all to avoid something that takes mere seconds. And yet, when next I need to take out the trash, this process will repeat. Making matters worse: someday it might not just be taking out the trash. Someday it might be dirty diapers I’m dealing with. It might be taking kids to the doctor. It might taking the medication I need to stay alive. And when that time comes will I just attempt to put it off? I want to say no, that I’ll be past all of this by then, that I’ll finally be a responsible organized adult… but an I’m adult now, damnit! I should already be better than this!
Stage 5: Ascension
That’s it! No more! I’m going to buy every item in this Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble, not just because it’s stylish and will tie my bathroom together nicely! No, that’s all secondary. Really, I’m doing it to prove to everyone–but especially myself–that I’m capable of taking the right steps and building good habits! New me, here we come!
Stage 6: Regression
Purchase made! Now, it’s time for bed. Shit, wait? It’s trash day tomorrow, isn’t it? I should take the bin to the curb. Although, there really are only a couple bags in there. I’m sure I’d be fine until next week…"	0.07			2018-09-01T04:00:01.758Z	0.3734081588603498	0.94	49783

There’s an old saying about innovation: “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.” It is derived from an Emerson quote that reads: “If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.” In this way, the saying is an example of itself; the ‘mousetrap’ variant is shorter, snappier, and conveys the exact same meaning, thus it is the one most often used.
The implication here is basically if you build it, they will come: you’ll have lines around the block, people from all over frantically waving their bills in the air demanding the latest in mouse-entrapment technology.
The truth, we know now, is a bit different.
The world, upon beating a path to your door, would say, “This mousetrap is smaller and more humane than the previous mousetrap, but now I’ve decided I want a mousetrap that is smaller and more humane.” Or, “I have no mice in my house, but many spiders, and this mousetrap did not catch a single spider, which is a bit of a disappointment.” Or, “Excuse me, I have some ideas for how you might make this better mousetrap–which is a good start–into an even greater mousetrap, despite the fact that I have never myself built any mousetrap.”
And so it goes with the Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Pack. You can put it in the microwave if you need heat, or you can put in the freezer if you want it to be cold. The ceramic beads heat and cool with the gel, providing a nice texture, which one Amazon reviewer says, “makes for an easy massage.” But the title of that review–“slightly different than the norm”–is telling. It implies that the incorporation of a heretofore never used component is something slight. Innovation, people seem to believe, requires a total redo.
Yes, some reviews expressed issues with durability. That’s understandable to call out. A few wished it would be more pliable when frozen. Again, fair.
But then there are the other “complaints.”
One says: “The only drawback I’ve seen so far to this item is its size. For the most part, I don’t think the size will be an issue because it’s probably rare to treat an area larger than 6x10”.""
Just so we’re clear: the only issue this reviewer could foresee would arise in a scenario that they couldn’t foresee arising.
Another–in a review titled “Does the job but not much better than competition”–claims: “the problem is just like every other reusable gel back I’ve ever used: they simply don’t remain truly hot or cold enough for long enough to do a good job. They’re more warm or cool than they are hot or cold for much longer.”
To put it differently: the biggest problem with this product, in this reviewer’s experience, is endemic to this entire product category, not just this product, and relies upon a universal tolerance of hot and cold temperatures.
The point of all this is to show that people will always find things to gripe about. And maybe they’re right. Still, it seems like the best case scenario is that you really love the texture of the ceramic beads inside the gel, and the worst case scenario is that you get three of totally passable hot/cold packs for $18.

Here we go again! The return of The Skeptics Choice, our occasional write-up segment wherein we read what a product claims to do and say, “hmm… I don’t know…” Today, we’re talking about a PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser. Follow along, won’t you?
The Claim
For all those who are thinking that we’ve been through this all before, fear not: this is a different kind of diffuser than the one we sold last time. This one is a “one-of-a-kind product combines the therapeutic properties of a pure Himalayan salt rock lamp with the soothing aromatherapy of an essential oil diffuser.” Apparently, it sets “the perfect mood for relaxation at home” and provides “all the benefits you would expect from this powerful combo.”
The Skepticism
That last part is a little presumptuous. All the benefits I would expect? I understand each word in the phrase “Himalayan Salt Lamp” on its own, but I know nothing about what they mean when they’re put together. But that’s no bother! It’s all laid out right there in the marketing copy:


The first benefit is that it will “help boost your mood.” And honestly, that sounds legit! When you’ve had your windows shut for almost 12 consecutive months because it took just a single day for the seasons transition from the bitter cold of winter to the brutal humidity of summer, something that makes the air smell pretty can be a nice little pick-me-up.


The second benefit is that it can “increase energy levels.” This seems a little more like bullshit than the first claim, but it’s vague enough that I’m willing to give it a pass.


The third benefit is that it will “neutralize the positively charged ions that emit from electronic devices like smartphones, televisions, radios, and more.”


Umm, what the fuck? That sure escalated quickly.
Seriously, the difference in hysteria levels from “it might boost your mood” to “it’ll protect you from killer ions” is about equal to the difference between a “hang in there, kitty” poster and one of those spam posts from MySpace that was like, “Post this on 10 of your friends’ profiles or else your eyes will fall out.”
And by the way, I’m not against a lot of this stuff. Crystals are fine. Astrology is fine. You could argue that it’s unscientific, but that’s missing the point. Life sucks sometimes. If getting some stones to put in your pocket makes you feel less like you’re flying a cloud of chaos towards an inevitably disappointing conclusion, more power to you! I watch groups of men in polyester play what is basically an IRL-board game involving sticks and balls on an enormous grass-and-dirt field, and if the group of men I like outplays the group of men I don’t like, I feel profound happiness. So, I try not to judge people for the things they use to pass the time.
But I will ABSOLUTELY judge anyone who preys upon someone based on those things. Because that’s what they’re doing here. They’re not saying: “you like this thing? we make this thing~” They’re saying, “we make this thing! it is DANGEROUS not to have this thing!!!” In other words, it’s taking something that should be a distraction from the chaos of daily life–which it totally could be, by the way: it’s cool looking; it lights up; it smells nice–and turning it into part of the chaos of daily life. And that’s messed up.
(Also, sorta tangential but still relevant, it’s problematic in a whole other way: What’s dangerous about technology is not that it’s pumping the air full of ions; it’s how intrusive it is. For example, did you know that if you say “Bloody Mary” three times into your smart phone, an ad for “great local brunch spots” will appear on your Facebook timeline? Our devices are definitely listening to us. We can all agree on that, right? Fine, maybe I’m just being paranoid. But you have to know that every Google search, every purchase, every photo you post is being mined for important data. And so making it a conversation about “ions” is pushing it in a direction that helps no one but those selling PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffusers.)
The Conclusion
If you want a thing that lights up and looks cool and smells nice, this is a good investment. If you’re thinking about buying this because you’re afraid to breath in all the electro-turds you released into the air while binging Sharp Objects, maybe open a window?"	0.05			2018-08-30T04:00:02.770Z	0.20794343938448737	0.93	60935

1.

I’m a lawyer, but right now, I’m not in the courtroom. Instead, it’s late at night and I’m in my office, wearing Ray-Ban glasses, poring over all the evidence of this grueling case, trying to find something to prove my client is innocent. All the older lawyers at this firm didn’t want to take my client on, and I’m starting to see why, but then again, I’m a young perky go-getter. Sometimes I worry that I’m too concerned with upholding justice, that I get too wrapped up in what’s right and wrong, that I fall in love with too many of my clients. But I can’t think about that now. I need to squint through my Ray-Bans at this piece of paper, then dig out another piece of paper and squint at that one, before realizing I’ve found it: a small but pretty obvious detail that proves my client wasn’t there that night. Thanks, Ray-Bans! I couldn’t have done it without you.

2.

I’m a bit of a nerd. You can tell because I’m always wearing these thick Ray-Ban frames. Also, I’m always doing nerdy things like taking notes in class or carrying a lot of books. Sometimes I drop them, to the delight of cheerleaders and jocks. My best friend is quirky and outgoing, but I am not. I have a figure that would require a nutritionist and hours of gym time each day to maintain, but you can’t see it under these bulky sweaters that I wear, while sitting in my bedroom listening to non-aggressive indie rock or reading an obscure book like Wuthering Heights or The Collected Plays of William Shakespeare. Perhaps someday, someone will move here from out of town and crack this high school’s social hierarchy wide open, but until then it’s just me, my one quirky friend, my books, my sweaters, and my Ray-Ban glasses.

3.

I’m what you might call a savant. I’m always doing things like solving unsolvable math equations, or going to the park and playing five games of chess at a time… and winning. The crisp lines of my Ray-Ban frames are definitely in stark contrast with my wildly disheveled hair! Can I tell you something? I wasn’t surprised to see the government suits show up at my house. What did surprise me was when they took me to the research facility and showed me what they found. I stared at it for a whole a minute. Then I dramatically took off my Ray-Ban glasses, wiped them on my shirt, and stared at it for a minute longer. I didn’t know what I was looking at. What I did know was that, despite being just a guy from Queens (with the IQ of a Nobel laureate), I might save the world. Strap in, Ray-Bans! This is going to be a long ride!

Dearest Meh Customers,
Apparently, our minds cannot be trusted, and for that we are sorry.
You see, in our previous attempt to sell these M Cushions, we misinterpreted a few things. By which we mean, we mistook several vague comments about the massager being applied to unnamed areas beyond the back to mean…
Hmmm…
How do we say it exactly?
Let’s try this: we thought you were implying that the M Cushion could be applied to places where the combination of friction and heat might bring about sensations not unrelated to relief, but a step beyond relief, a sort of deep relief that goes by many names, one of which it shares with a term from film and literature meaning the culmination of the story’s drama.
But, um… apparently we were a little off-base. As one quoted commenter noted:

I swear I didn’t mean it in a sexual way. I just meant after leg day you can lean back in bed and use it on your aching thighs rather comfortably.

Time to dive into our library of branded content romance novels, for a tale of secrecy, royalty, and grilling. Please enjoy these excerpts from Coals Aflame by Criminy Highlater.

Grilling with one tool? Mary had gotten used to that thanks to her Starfrit Tonglite. In many ways, she was a lot like the 6-in-1 bbq multi-tool: she was strong, she had many skills, could do many things, and, since Eric had run off with his secretary a year before, she relied only on herself.
Which was what she planned to do that Saturday afternoon. Her work at the non-profit, helping troubled youth gain acceptance to Ivy League schools, didn’t leave her much time for making friends, so she would do it on her own. She would take a cooler, her little grill, and her Starfrit, and she would go from her apartment in Soho to Central Park to have a little cookout for one. It would be simple… or so she thought.
“M’lady, if I may have a word,” came a voice soon after she’d set up. Mary ignored it, thinking it sounded so British and refined that it must be coming from someone’s radio. But when it persisted, she looked up.
An austere and very handsome man stood in front of her.
“There you are,” he said. “I couldn’t help but gain sight of your grill, and I wondered if I might bequeath you of a favor?”
Mary had gotten good at doing things alone since Eric left, but there was something interesting about this man, something that made her desire his company.

The man said his name was Collin, and he worked for the a mysterious member of the royal family, Prince Nigel. Mary remembered seeing on the news that Nigel was making his first visit to the United States. She hadn’t listened to the story, because she’d been distracted by the strange mask the prince seemed to wear everywhere.
“What kind of work do you do for him?” Mary asked.
“All sorts,” was all Collin said.
“And so what can I help you with?” Mary asked.
“Well, being among the prince’s central envoy, I am privy to many of the finest restaurants in the world, but I don’t always want to partake in such luxury. And I was hoping you might allow me to dine with you, to take in a true American meal!”
“That’s it?” Mary asked. “You want a burger and some hot dogs?”
“'Tis my heart’s desire,” Collin said with a winning smile. “And if it would please you, I’d be happy to help. For example, perhaps I will unpack the remainder of the tools you require for grilling?”
Mary smiled and held up the Starfrit. “I only need one!”

Mary flipped burgers with the spatula when the upper arm was drawn back and rotated hot dogs with the tongs when the upper arm was extended. She opened them each a bottle of beer with the opener. “A fine colonial ale!” Collin said. Mary laughed, using the Starfrit’s serrated edge to cut the buns.
While they ate, Mary asked, “So is Prince Nigel really as eccentric as he seems?”
“You’re asking about the mask, I presume?”
Mary blushed. ""Well, I–
Collin laughed. “It’s no issue. It’s what everyone wants to know: why is he always wearing that strange masquerade mask, the one behind which he has hidden since his youth? Is his face disfigured? Is he some sort of lunatic? But the truth is, he simply desires privacy. He doesn’t want to be followed everywhere he goes.”
Mary opened her mouth, ready to say that this made sense–that she could not imagine what it must be like–when suddenly the sky went dark.
Nearby people screamed. Collin grabbed her hand, fearfully. “My god, it’s some sort of unpredicted total solar eclipse! Not even my royal astronomer saw this coming!”
Mary switched on the Starfrit’s flashlight, which she usually only used for convenient nighttime cooking.
“What do you mean ‘your’ royal astronomer?” She asked. She pointed the flashlight towards him, then towards his arm, and down to wear his hand still held hers. She felt a rush of something she had not felt in some time, not since Eric.
But then, the sun came back. Mary turned the light off and set the Starfrit down. Collin quickly stood. “I’ve just realized something, something very important,” he said. “Blast, I have so much bloody work. I must be retreating, but perhaps we could meet later? For another ale?”
Mary nodded. Collin named a bar–a dingy sports bar on the East Side–and a time. With that, he was gone. When Mary went to pack up, she couldn’t find her Starfrit anywhere. Which was a shame, as its scraper feature certainly would’ve helped her to clean her grill.

Mary waited at the bar, nursing her beer. The televisions were all turned to the baseball game, with the sound way up. Occasionally, a promo for the evening news promised coverage of Prince Nigel’s visit as well as the strange lunar happening of the afternoon.
“Who cares,” Mary mumbled to herself. Collin was late. Of course he was! He probably wasn’t coming. Another near-miss with love, she thought.
Just then, the feed cut out from the baseball game. “We interrupt this broadcast to bring you, a statement from Prince Nigel the Third.”
There he stood, the man in the strange mask. Mary laughed. He looked so silly. Then he spoke.
“Good morrow, our friends from across the pond,” he said.
Mary felt herself go rigid. She recognized that voice! But no, it couldn’t be. Could it?
“Collin?” she said, as if he could answer her through the television.
“It has been lovely visiting your many museums and areas of historical importance,” the prince went on. “But it was none of them that taught me the most. It was a single person–a single woman–who showed me the true American character, one that is not afraid of multiplicity.” He held up the Starfrit; Mary’s breath caught. “I’ve learned that, like this tool, Americans can do great things, many different great things, and are not as easily categorizable as they seem. And like this tool, they can do wonders at a grill.”
The crowd broke out in laughter in applause. Cameras flashed.
“Now, I may have more to say on this later. But right now, I must be going. I need to return this to its rightful owner. I fear I may even be late!” Just as quickly as the address had begun, it was over. The baseball game returned.
“Anyone sitting here?” a woman said to Mary, indicating the seat next to her at a bar.
Mary smiled. “Yes,” she said. “Or I should say, he’s on his way here now.”"	0.07			2018-08-25T04:00:01.567Z	0.3806925754768836	0.9	53347	0.020357891736731745

When you see an 8-piece cookware set like this–which is really a 4-piece cookware set with a lid for each item–there’s likely an image that comes to mind.
You see yourself standing at the stove, each of the four burners occupied by one of the pots or pans. Perhaps a sauce simmers in one and water comes to a boil in another for pasta that you rolled yourself. You’re sautéing some garlic and onions in yet another, and not with a spatula; instead, with just a flick of your wrist you are cycling it through the air like they do in cooking shows. In the final pan, you brown your steaks before moving them to the oven, where they will cook to a perfect medium rare.
But this image is a fantasy. You can’t actually manage cooking four precise things at once. Honestly, if your stove had only one or two burners, it would work just fine. It might free up some counter space for dealing with the onions you forgot to mince until after your butter had already melted (and burned) in the frying pan.
Thus, purchasing four pots and pans all at once is not necessary, but it is aspirational. You need to keep the dream alive, of wowing your friends and family members with perfectly balanced 4-part meals that make use of descriptors like “deconstructed” or “molecular” or “done three ways.” To have only one pan or one pot would be to admit defeat, to shut the door on your glorious dreams.
In the meantime, great news: you can make your signature “pasta a la butter and a handful of shredded cheese” in one of these just fine! And if you want to make the same thing tomorrow, even more great news: you don’t even need to do the dishes because you’ve got three other cooking vessels just waiting for a turn!"	0.05			2018-08-24T04:00:01.907Z	0.23620242900706845	0.93	59918

In school, you only wore your backpack on one shoulder. When that shoulder started to feel sore from carrying your entire load of books, you shifted it to the other shoulder. This should’ve been all the proof you need: that the most efficient way to wear a backpack is by using both arm straps. So why didn’t you? Because it didn’t look as cool and nonchalant as the single strap technique.
There are more examples: pocket protectors are nerd-wear, despite serving what is actually a pretty useful function. And for all the work automobile manufactures put into building incredibly efficient engines, for a while it seemed like they couldn’t design a hybrid that didn’t look like some sort of weird robo-ladybug.

Whoa. Got a bit deep there.

Dearest Anthony,
It is with a heavy heart that I compose this letter. When you return from your stint with the touring company, you will find me gone, and while we will always be brothers, I will no longer be welcome in our family’s house.
As you might suspect, father discovered my designs. He left for the park to perform his troupe. It was a production of Twelfth Knight, and while he had mentioned that it had been adapted for sock puppets, he made no indication that such modifications involved a shortening of runtime. Thus, I thought I would have nearly three hours of uninterrupted work time. When he arrived home just forty-five minutes later, he found me hard at work on my makeshift drawing table.
Now, I know what you are thinking: why did I not simply lie? You instructed me to do just that when I first confided in you about the designs. But Anthony, I have been lying all my life. I attended L’Academie Royale De L’Art Textile to study sock puppeteering at the age of fifteen. The instructors told me I could emote more with my wrists and palms than most classically trained thespians could with the whole of their bodies. I graduated at the top of my class and received invitations from several of the most renowned touring companies. I traveled the globe. By the age of seventeen, I had performed for two kings and six queens. But it was never what I wanted. I didn’t want to be a sock puppeteer like father and like all of our uncles, like grandfather before them, like you.
And I told father so. When he found me at my drawing table and asked what it was I was scribbling, I confessed everything: that the pretense under which I had returned home–to found my own sock puppet theater–was untrue; that I wanted no longer to act with socks but make my own socks, socks that, in their design alone, possessed as much vibrant life as could be instilled by a skilled sock puppeteer.
Father did not appreciate this, of course. He scoffed at my plans. He told me that out there, beyond the cardboard walls of a sock puppet theater, socks were not lauded but ridiculed. He said there was no such thing as a vibrant life-affirming sock out there. He said they were simple and drab, a mere treaty between foot and shoe.
Moreover, he said I have two options: I must either cast my designs into the fireplace and resume my pursuit of sock puppetry, or forever be banished from his house. As the opening this letter has surely confirmed, I have chosen the latter. I will be traveling far away from here, all the way to the Americas.
So, fare thee well, brother. While it is unlikely that our paths will cross again, perhaps someday you will be in clothing store and you will see a brand of exciting colorful socks with my name upon them and know I have lived my dream.
Yours,
Ezekiel"	0.05			2018-08-22T04:00:07.337Z	0.3287164649283502	0.94	61717			0.03937749319454194	0.07019466178157474

Today’s Order/Hoarder product:
WWE TeenyMates!!!
What we’ve got here are some little mystery grab-bags containing cute-ified versions of your favorite (or least favorite) WWE wrestlers. As with each of these Order/Hoarder sales, we like to provide a little math breakdown: for $5, you can get 8 packs of them, which comes out to 63 cents each. On the other hand, you could get 64 packs for just $20. That’s 31 cents each, right? WRONG! Since you can only order 8 or 64, the first 8 cost $5, and the last 56 cost $15, which means those last 56 are costing you just about 27 cents each! That’s one quarter and two pennies! And when you consider that each pack contains 2… that’s less than 14 cents per wrestler!
And if you’re like, “why would I need 128 of these things?” here are a few helpful suggestions:


Put a bowl of them at the end of your desk at work, and if anyone asks you why, just say, in as condescending a voice as possible: “It’s healthier to hold a tiny wrestler than it is to eat candy.”


Give them away at your kids’ parties. Do you kids and their like wrestlers? Great! They’ll love these things. Do they not like wrestlers? That’s okay too. They won’t know who any of these people are and you can just call them L’il Fun Buddies or something.


Isn’t it about time your little Christmas village got some extreme new residents?


Glue them to your dashboard and let them intimidate you into being a better driver.


Carry them around with you and conduct a social experiment called: how many random people on the street will catch a little wrestler when you say to them: hey you, catch this little wrestler?


You do realize it’s only 71 days till Halloween, right?

Let’s just get right to the basic question here: what is so damn smart about these Smart Stands?
“Smart” has come to be synonymous with “online” or “connected to wifi.” But these Smart Stands are neither. They are an amalgamation of plastic and hinge. There is no voice control or app so you can manage it while you’re on vacation or built-in analytics to tell you how you might best use it in the future, based on your past trends. They just sit there and holds up your tablet or phone.
And maybe in that way they’re the smartest of “smart” products: because they’re smart enough to know what they do well, and also to know what they don’t need to do.
The past is a veritable web of failed innovations. Just like no one wanted pasta from Panera or personal pizzas from Subway, nobody’s pining for some bullshit half-functional beta-level technology to do something that was already extremely simple. Being “smart” is not just creating new complicated functions to prove you can; it’s pausing before you do all the work and asking, “Wait, why are we doing this? Is this actually necessary?”
But you know who didn’t skip that step? Smart Stands. They asked, “Why?” And they said, “Because sometimes you want your tablet to be up like this rather than down like that.” And then they asked, “Should we go further?” And they decided: “No, because the further we go, the more we risk losing our greatest asset, which is that our stands are universally compatible with all phones and tablets.”
See, sometimes intelligence is knowing when to stop and say, “Good enough for me.” Which is why these smart stands are good enough for you, no matter what kind of device you prefer."	0.07			2018-08-19T04:00:02.021Z	0.46941764127665553	0.94	53660			0.024072699552649

Yes, we mentioned the blender bottles sale from a couple Saturdays ago in yesterday’s write-up, but we were mostly talking about the bottles themselves. Today, we’d like to talk about the sale.
See, that sale was an experiment. We offered two choices: a rational number of bottles (the 4-pack) for a good price; or an irrational number of bottles (the 16-pack) for an even better price, with no middle ground. We wanted to know, could we bait you into making a totally ridiculous purchase just by making you feel like you’d gotten a ‘great deal’?
The answer, in a fair number of cases, was ‘yes!’ And so here we are again.
Now, before we get to the product, we need to name this as-of-today recurring sale type. Some ideas:
The Excess Express: Because like an express train, there are few stops between where you should go and the end of the line!
DTB: Does it stand for “Down to buy”? Nope! It’s “Direct to Basement.” Because you don’t need to pretend you’re actually going to use all this stuff! Take one out, deposit the rest downstairs with all the other stuff you thought was a good investment!
Any or Many: Pretty self-explanatory. Other option, along these lines: “More or Less.” Other other option, along these lines: “Deal or Mo’ Deal.”
Irrational Numbers: Are these deals really that much like the mathematical concept of irrational numbers? Yes–because the logic of either is hard to explain–but also no–because only one of them will make you feel smart.
(Also, hello nerds, who are right now gearing up to compose some long screed in the comments about how, well, actually, it’s not that difficult at all to explain irrational numbers!)
Anyway, you can vote on those on today’s poll (and give your own suggestions). Who knows! Maybe if this works, we’ll have a whole spin-off site where do only this kind of deal! Eh?!
As for today’s product, here’s some info: they’re power banks, so it’s not exactly as impractical to have a bunch of them as it was with the blender bottles. Also, we sold something that looks like these before, with the shoe sole pattern, but these are the 6000mAh version, whereas last time they were 9000mAh. On the plus side: that means they’re smaller. On the downside: that means they have less charging capacity (each one can carry enough power to charge the average phone about 3 full times, rather than 4 with the other version).
But really, what’s important is THE DEAL! Because think about: at 2 for $12, that’s $6 per power bank. Not a bad price at all. BUT if you opt for 10, and assume that the first 2 cost $6 each, that means the last 8 cost just $24, or a mere $3 each! And if you go deeper and consider that each of those 8 is rated at 6,000 milliamp hours, that means that you’re only paying $0.0005 per mAh! And $0.0005 is basically nothing, and a lot of nothing is still nothing, therefore, WE’RE PRETTY MUCH GIVING THESE THINGS AWAY!
Okay, maybe we kind of flubbed up the logic there. But the question remains: do you want a boring old 2-pack of Xsories 6000mAh Power Banks for $12 or an amazing 10 for $36?!"	0.07			2018-08-18T04:00:05.333Z	0.3572084668612603	0.93	53049			0.024494294870486415

You probably saw the word “blender” and the word “bottle” and thought, why do I need this thing when I just received my 4 or 16 pack of blender bottles? But the products are actually very different. For example, the blender bottles we sold before were both blenders and bottles, whereas this is a blender that comes with two vessels for blending that are themselves bottles.
Or, to put it differently:
The blender bottles are bottles that can blend things inside the bottle, whereas this is a blender that blend things inside one of the two bottles that come with it (or more than two, if you order more than one blender, in which case, you simply need to multiply the number of blenders you order by two to ascertain the number of bottles, which again, are not blender bottles, but bottles that work with this blender).
But here’s the thing: even if you ordered the blender bottles, you can still order this blender and bottles, because the blender and the blender bottles (not to be confused with the bottles that come with the blender) can be used together (although, obviously, the blender and the bottles it comes with can be used together too). See, blender bottles we sold a couple weeks ago, having only a small metal ball rather than a blade or a motor (like this blender has), aren’t really great at being blenders, but they are good at whisking things (so maybe they should be called ‘whisker bottles,’ although on second thought, maybe not, as that sounds like something altogether different and unappealing).
Point is, you could use the blender–this one, the one with a motor and a blade–for more intense blending jobs, like making a fruit smoothie. Then, you can pour the smoothie from the blender’s blending bottle into a blender bottle and take it with you wherever you’re going, so that you can whisk it back together if it settles.
What we’re saying is that what you should really do is buy this blender and two bottles and then pour the things you make in the blender’s bottles into one of your blender bottles, while using the bottles that come with the blender just for the initial blending.
Unless you didn’t buy the blender bottles. In which case, disregard the above."	0.05			2018-08-17T04:00:10.364Z	0.30912710887561573	0.94	60832

Well, this is a first from our branded content romance novel collection: a teenaged paranormal love story! Please enjoy these excerpts of The Heart Races Until It Rests by Annborny Hilledale.

Ellie met Henri while running.
She was not looking for love. When she’d quit the cheerleading squad to join cross-country, her boyfriend Brad, the quarterback of the school’s football team, dumped her because her running gear didn’t look “as hot.” She was relieved more than anything. She was a senior and she had decisions to make: did she want to go to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Oxford, or one of the other ivy league schools she’d gotten into?
Really, Ellie wanted to got to a small liberal arts school and study poetry, but it wasn’t up to her. Both her mother and her father were founders and CEOs of very powerful companies, and they’d both fought so much about whose company Ellie would eventually take over that they’d gotten a divorce. The only thing they could agree on anymore: Ellie had to study business.
Her Polar Heart Rate Monitor beeped helpfully to let her know her heart rate had risen above her optimal zone. Ellie often ran too fast when she got anxious about the future.
She slowed down, which was when the boy appeared at her side. ‘Appeared’ because Ellie hadn’t seen him approach. “Good day!” he said with a smile. He looked about her age but also–Ellie couldn’t exactly describe it–almost sepia-toned? He wore a strange antiquated cotton shirt and cotton shorts and his shoes appeared old-fashioned, with almost no support. “The name is Henri. I’ve just begun to undertake the task of what I’ve heard referred to as ‘cardiovascular activity’ and I was wondering if you might allow me to accompany you!”
Ellie looked at her Polar Heart Rate Monitor again. Its easy-to-read screen let her know that she’d reached her workout goal for the day. “Sorry. I’m actually just wrapping up.”
Henri looked at his shoes, disappointed. “I understand,” he said.
“But tomorrow,” Ellie heard herself say. She didn’t know why. There was something interesting about him. “I’ll pick you up at your house and we’ll go for a jog. Where do you live?”
“Just past 229 Healy Street.” Something seemed to occur to Henri. “But upon a secondary thought, t’wouldst it be possible to meet right here?”
Ellie agreed. The plan was set.

For all his grandstanding about not understanding ‘cardiovascular activity’ Henri never seemed to get tired. They talked the whole way about classic poetry. Henri was very familiar and spoke about the poets in a funny way. Like with his look, Ellie couldn’t exactly place the strangeness of his tone except to say it seemed that he often spoke as if he knew the poets personally. She chalked it up to an affect, of which Henri had plenty!
“What is that strange jewelry you wear?” he asked at one point.
“This? It’s my Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Its convenient display makes it easy to track my total calories burned per session as well as provide a weekly training summary.”
“Is it expressly designed for this very activity?”
“Nope! It’s great for biking, circuit training, or even just walking. Here do you want to try it on?”
“Oh, that’s not necessary–” Henri started to say, but Ellie had already stopped and slipped it off her wrist. Had this all been a ploy to take his exceedingly pale wrist into her hand? Did she have a growing desire to touch him? Perhaps, but Henri seemed uncomfortable, and they ran the rest of the way in silence.
Later, when she uploaded the data easily to her free profile at polarpersonaltrainer.com by way of her Polar Flowlink, she noticed something odd. The data for her run was there, but around the time she put the watch on Henri, all heart rate readings went blank.
“Huh,” she said. “Must be an issue with the monitor.” But her Polar Heart Rate Monitor had always worked flawlessly before…

It kept happening. Each day, the Polar would continuously display her own heart rate, and when Henri would wear it for the second half of their run–something Ellie insisted on, as a means of testing its functionality–there would be no reading.
But she didn’t know how to tell him something was wrong. Just as they managed to remain in the optimal zone for burning fat thanks to the Heart Rate Monitor, so too did it feel as if they were always in the optimal zone for conversation. She could tell Henri anything and he seemed to understand: about her parents, about her college decision, or about her day at school (from which he was conspicuously absent).
Finally, one day she couldn’t help it.
“Henri,” she said. “I need to tell you something. I’m in love with you.”
“And I need to tell you something,” Henri said. “Ellie, I’m a ghost. The ghost of Henri Olson, a long forgotten poet who died in his teens.”
Ellie should’ve been surprised, but somehow she wasn’t. “So that’s why your heart rate never showed up.”
“Alas!” he cried. “But if it could, it would read a number so high, as just the sight of you sets me aflutter! You see, I have unfinished business, Ellie. I have never felt love.”
“Never?”
“You must understand: it was a different time when I was born. We weren’t worried about heart rates. If we could have such a glorious device as that Polar when I was growing up, it would not measure calories but risk of scarlet fever. In such a dangerous time, can one ever feel true love? I say no, despite writing so many poems about it. But with you Ellie, well I’ve been trying to deny it. To admit so much would be to finish my unfinished business…”
“Just kiss me,” Ellie said. She leaned forward with her eyes closed and their lips met. She tasted no salty sweat on his lips, despite that the Polar Heart Rate Monitor said they’d really been pushing themselves. But of course she wouldn’t. Ghosts didn’t sweat, not even beautiful ones.
In the moment before she could open her eyes, Henri whispered: “Ellie, I love you.”
Ellie found herself alone on the road.

The dean of the English department at the small idyllic Halpern College ushered Ellie into his office. She didn’t wear her Polar Heart Rate Monitor because she was afraid her rapid nervous heartbeat would set off an alarm.
“It’s quite unusual,” the dean said, “for a freshman to win our annual award for gothic poetry, but the imagery you’ve presented–of the final kiss, of riding your bike past his supposed address and finding a graveyard, all of it–it’s just so lovely. Such a wonderful imagination.”
“You could call it that,” Ellie said.
“So I’m pleased to say, as your reward, we will purchase any book for the library in your name. Now, don’t be afraid to take some time to think it over–”
“The Collected Works of Henri Olson.”
The dean cocked his head to the side. “I don’t think I’ve heard of him?”
“He died very young,” Ellie said, pretending to rub her eye to wipe away a tear. “But he–I mean, his poems–they were really quite lovely.”"	0.05			2018-08-16T04:00:03.517Z	0.23418002803322968	0.94	61944

Friends, before reading further, lock your doors, turn on all of the lights, and gather your pets and loved ones tight, because the following is a horror story.
We begin with a young man. Let us give him a name. Let us call him Sean.
This all happened some years ago, when Sean was just a naive young man who believed, due to being brought up in the Northeast within proximity to a certain corporate food chain, that donut shops could be relied upon for iced coffee. It was this misunderstanding that will ultimately lead to our story’s tragic end. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Sean, walking the streets of Seattle on a hot summer afternoon, entered a donut shop–not one of the fancy ones you may have heard of; a small, out-of-the-way place that will remain nameless–and asked the man behind the counter, “Do you have iced coffee?”
The man replied, “Yes, we have iced coffee.” Or no, that’s not it. That’s not it at all. What he said was: “Yes, I can do iced coffee.”
This should’ve been the tell, the sign that something was amiss and Sean should flee that donut shop. But he ignored the portents. He removed a small bill and said, “Great, I’ll have an iced coffee then.”
What happened next is almost too gruesome to put into words.
Almost.
The man behind the counter took a large styrofoam cup, filled it with ice, and proceeded to pour hot coffee from the pot directly over it, handing Sean, to his horror, a lukewarm watery mess.
But do not grieve for Sean. Do not shed one single tear over his ruined attempt to seek cold caffeination. For Sean is a complex protagonist, and he is not without blame here.
Because why was he even seeking to purchase an iced coffee in the first place? Why was he not buying beans in bulk and then using this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Bundle to make his own deliciously smooth and delightfully cheap iced coffee at home? Perhaps, if he had, the day before, loaded up the 1.6 qt. cold brew carafe–or the bottle, which he could’ve carried with him–he might have avoided such a cruel fate.
As is the case with many stories of terror and woe, this is a cautionary tale. Do not, dear reader, make the same mistake Sean made. Buy this bundle and live forever in cold coffee bliss."	0.05			2018-08-15T04:00:09.341Z	0.31881841989687204	0.93	65238

It’s about halfway down the feature bullets to these Medical Forehead and Ear Digital Thermometers that you see this:

“JUST ONE BUTTON to press. No more fear of breaking a glass or swallowing mercury.”

And you’re reminded that there was a time when, in the name of health, we put a glass tube of an extremely dangerous chemical into the mouths of children.
Children.
Children who might heave their favorite toy across the room just to see if it can fly. Children who eat the erasers on the end of a #2 pencil because it looks like gum. They were given a tube made of glass–the most satisfying of all smashables–filled with a weird, perhaps even delicious-looking, red substance.
Kids these days have it easy.
Or do they?
My mom, a nurse, always had a cupboard in the bathroom stocked with the most up-to-date medical paraphernalia. Therefore, we had a digital thermometer from the beginning. It was nice. Like this one, no mercury. Like this one, an easy straightforward digital readout of your temperature. Unlike this one, it took what felt like a half-hour to give a final verdict on whether or not you’d reached that magical realm north of 98.6 and earned the day off from school. And so, it wasn’t uncommon for the temperature-taker to put the thermometer in the child’s mouth and then walk away to take care of something else, allowing the child freedom to manipulate, through a variety of means, the final result.
This is hypothetical, of course. I would never have done such a thing.
(Oh, and also, just an FYI: that whole 98.6 being the average human temperature thing is the result of tests conducted by one doctor using a crummy armpit thermometer in the 19th century and is mostly bullshit.)
These thermometers, meanwhile, can register a temperature in seconds from the mouth or the forehead, thus disallowing for any alteration of results.

On day one, we sold a Roomba. That was in July, 2014. In the last 5 months of that year–our first 5 months of operation–we sold 5 more Roombas. We sold one or two in 2015. Since then, nothing. No more Roombas…

What’s the best metaphor to capture the excitement of our reunification? Perhaps we could think of ourselves as a once famous rock band who amicably splintered to pursue our solo careers. We would certainly be the experimental-minded keyboardist, doing avant-guard work with help of speaker docks and vacuum sealers, whereas the Roomba would be the pop-forward frontman, producing hit after hit, each one more-or-less the same.
And now comes our glorious reunion tour!
(Although, now that I think about it, don’t bands usually reunite when the “well has run dry,” so to speak? As in: a last ditch effort to regain their former wealth or reputation?)
How about a different metaphor: in the 2015 we let the Roomba go off to clean, and now, after many years of service to the greater world, it’s made its circuitous way back to Meh, its noble charging port!
Nice pivot, eh?
Anyway, as we implied above, in the time since we last sold a Roomba, there have been, by our estimation, 6,000 new models released, all of which look almost exactly the same. So, if you’re wondering why you should buy this Roomba instead of a different Roomba, we are too.

But it does have a lot of the other things that make those models great, such as a big bin and an AeroForce High Efficiency Filter, meaning the air that passes through it comes out a lot cleaner (which could be a big deal for allergy sufferers).

When the employees arrived at their first day at the new NOTILUS headquarters, they noticed something strange.
“There is no roof,” one of them said.
“Exactly,” said one of the higher-ups. “It’s an open-roof open-office.”
“But we won’t be protected from the rain,” said another employee.
“Exactly,” the higher-up said again.
The building had tile floors and was equipped with a siren. It sounded whenever a storm approached, at which point, the employees took the tarps provided to them and covered their computers, their phones, anything that could succumb to water damage. Then, they stood. They closed their eyes. They waited for the rain to wash over them so that they could understand it, become one with it.
Thus, when they engineered their shower heads to have 6 settings including “Wide Rainfall” and “Power Rain,” they knew these to be the true to their names. And when they built dual-zone antimicrobial jets that did not clog, it was not only to provide their customers with consistently strong water pressure; it was to mimic the rain that, year after year, never ceased to lessen in its strength.

A lot of the stuff we sell can be categorized as zero-to-sale items. You come here thinking, “I don’t need anything,” and you leave with some headphones or a bunch of junky phone accessories or a veritable pile of blender bottles. Additionally, some of the stuff that ends up here requires some explanation: they’re light bulbs that are also bluetooth speakers? What do you mean, “LED Name-tags”? Hold up, how many audiobooks? That sort of thing.
But this ain’t either of those.
Given that it’s the most expensive product we’ve probably ever sold on Meh, it’s definitely not an impulse buy. Unless you’re, like, a billionaire. In which case, a) what exactly are you doing here? And b) can we get a cool 5 mil to launch our new app? Hear us out: It’s like Shazam, but for smells!
Likewise, the concept of it doesn’t need to be explained. “You know how you have eyes? And when you point them at things, you see the things? And how sometimes, there’s a certain angle from which the things look pretty cool? Well, this ingenious contraption allows you to capture those angles so that you can see the things, even when you’re not near the things.”
Seriously, trying to think of how you’d describe a camera to someone who’s never heard of cameras is actually making me more confused about cameras. So I’ll stop trying and just tell you exactly what we’re dealing with here:
This is a nudge buy.
If you’re someone who’s been thinking about getting a DSLR for a while, biding your time and doing the appropriate level of research required of such a significant purchase, you’re our ideal customer today. Because, we’re basically trying to push you that little bit towards finally saying, “you know what? Screw it. Today’s the day!” And in return, you get this really great DSLR camera and a bunch of lenses and accessories for $100 less than you can get it elsewhere.
And btw, if you’re thinking, nah, I’ll just wait until this price drops, or find somewhere selling it for cheaper, we’ve got some bad news for you. Canon stuff basically never goes down in price. We explain why in detail here. Seriously, go read that. It’s very informative, and one of our best write-ups (which I say with only jealousy, because ugh, I didn’t write it, okay?).
So what do you say, shopper teetering on the fence between Rebel T6i admirer and Rebel T6i owner? With this offer, have we given you a thorough enough poke?

The great philosopher Zaza Pachulia once said: “Nothing easy.” He was referring to the 8th seed Atlanta Hawks forcing a game seven against the 1st seed Boston Celtics, but his words are applicable to so many things in life. For us, there is “nothing easy” about balancing our standards for honest copy with our desire to offer a diverse range of products. Some days, it just seems untenable. And friends, today is one of those days. Because if I gave my 100% honest opinion of this ProCabello Straightener and Styler Kit it would be this:
IDK, it looks good to me, I guess.
See, I don’t actually know. I’ve never used a hair straightener, nor can I foresee a scenario arising in the future where I will either. Then again, this isn’t my first rodeo. There’ve been plenty of products I don’t particularly care about, and when they come up, there’s a simple solution: lean on the Amazon reviews.
Unfortunately this doesn’t help me much here, because the reviews, while positive (and that’s despite the significantly higher price point WITHOUT the “Shine and Hold Spray” we’re including), say very little.
For example, here is Diane Camargo’s review in full:

Love it!! The best flat iron I’ve used

And Karen Tucci writes:

Awesome flat iron. Heats up super fast. Has multiple heat settings. Very happy with my purchase.

And Adrian Blake Hammonds writes:

I love the way my hair feels.

Is it good to see such positive reviews of the item we’re selling? Sure. Do these reviews help me, as a copywriter, find an interesting angle for my write-up? No. Did I include three of them when one would suffice simply to push the write-up further down the page, thus making it appear longer? Of course. Unless it’s @Dave asking, in which case, no way! I did it for integrity!
Really the point is, it’s difficult to write about something without any personal attachment to even the concept of it. That’s why so much copy looks like… well… copy. But that’s not what we want. Likewise, we can’t just sell the stuff we know how to write about. We need to sell items that are outside of our comfort zone sometimes. Are they outside of the greater Meh community’s comfort zone, too? Maybe. Only time (and all of the graphs at the bottom of the page) will tell.
In the meantime, if you know a thing or two about hair straighteners, maybe help us out by leaving a few comments. And if you don’t, but you know someone who does, send this along to them.

We’ve got another weird item pedaling vague impossible-to-prove pseudo-science, so that means another installment of THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE: a feature wherein we lay out the product’s claims and explain why we’re not so sure we believe them. Here goes!
The Claim
The Pure Daily Care Diffuser is the “ultimate starter pack for essential oil enthusiasts.” The various botanical oils are “100% pure” and also “100% organic” with “no fillers or additives.” All of this is fairly simple. Where it gets more interesting is in laying out the benefits of each included oil:

Peppermint is a “mental stimulant” that “provides energy”;
Orange is a “respiratory stimulator, antiseptic, antidepressant, aphrodisiac, and neural stimulator”;
Tea Tree is a “powerful immune stimulator”;
Lemongrass is “neural stimulator” that “soothes aches and pains while also reducing anxiety”;
Lavender is another “neural stimulator” that “reduces stress and anxiety and promotes restful sleep”;
and Eucalyptus is a “respiratory booster” and is “great for relieving sinus congestions.”

The Skepticism
Perhaps I shouldn’t call myself skeptical here. I’m not skeptical. I think this is bullshit, and moreover, I think it’s pretty dangerous. Not the diffuser itself, but the language.
Because eucalyptus oil will not relieve sinus congestion in a meaningful way. And lemongrass oil isn’t going to help with your sore joints. And orange oil is as much an antidepressant as the two day old styrofoam tub that held raw chicken in the trash is a depressant. By which I mean: walking into a house that smells bad sucks, and therefore will make you feel unhappy; so, conversely, walking into a house that smells good doesn’t suck, thus making you happy by contrast.
This is all to say that if you have sinus issues, or joint pain, or depression, don’t just buy a diffuser. See a doctor.
But again, this is an issue of language, specifically language that makes empty promises. The actual truth is essential oil diffusers are great. They don’t smell as fake and chemical-y as plug-ins. They’re not smokey like incense. It’s kinda cool to watch the mist rise out of them. And this one has 7 neat ambient light settings.
That’s why my wife and I are buying one: not for any medical reasons, but because we just moved into a new house and we want it to smell okay. Even when I forget to take out the trash…
In Conclusion
Diffusers are actually pretty nice, as long as what you’re looking for is a good smell, and not a cure."	0.05			2018-08-08T04:00:06.259Z	0.21768616353254416	0.94	62973

It’s been a while since we’ve been able to dip into our library of branded content romance novels, but luckily, we found one that just happens to involve today’s product. Get ready for a tale of desire and medical emergencies in these excerpts from Gene Harmony’s Love Is A Medicine Best Served At The Appropriate Temperature(s).

People were always asking Dale to open jars because of his amazingly strong arms. And people were also always asking why, when he could so easily be a model, he chose to work at the front desk of a pharmaceuticals lab. “Not everyone wants to be on the runway,” he’d say with a smile of clean white teeth that reinforced his model-like qualities. The real answer, though, was that he’d always had the desire to save lives. Working here, where so many important medications were developed, was the closest he could get.
Dale wasn’t the only one in the lab whose good looks were surprising. Rumor had it that Dr. Liza modeled to pay her way through graduate school on the way to becoming the world’s foremost expert on life-saving drugs. Whether that was true or not, Dale had to admit: she was beautiful. Even now, as she rushed up to the desk in her lab coat, clearly flustered, she looked exquisite.
Dale thought maybe she was coming to flirt, something that happened often, though nothing ever came of it. She was a lauded scientist, after all, and he a lowly receptionist. But flirting was not on the agenda today.
“Can I ask a big favor?” she said. “No one else is available to help and there’s a patient in need of an experimental medication. We have to get to the hospital, so it can be safely administered. Could you give me a ride?”
“No problem,” Dale said, standing.
“But there is a problem,” Dr. Liza said. “It’s a complicated medication, comprised of three very volatile liquids that cannot be combined until the last possible minute before being administered. Also, each substance must be kept within a certain temperature range. If I leave them in their test-tubes, they’ll grow too warm or too cold on the ride over.”
“I have just the thing,” Dale said.

Dale and Dr. Liza carried the four Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs out to his car: three filled with temperature controlled substances, one extra, “Just in case,” Dr. Liza had said.
“We need to be careful with these,” she said now, but it was not an issue at all, given that the Primulas’ contemporary attractive twist-textured design allowed for a secure grip. Not to mention they were splash-resistant! “And you’re sure they’re not contaminated?”
“Absolutely,” said Dale. “It’s very easy to clean the mugs themselves. And I put the lids through my dishwasher at home, on the top rack, where it’s safe for them to go.”
Dale could tell that Dr. Liza, though still nervous, was happy to hear this. And she was even happier when she saw that all four mugs fit into the various front- and back-seat cup-holders of Dale’s modest hatchback. “Like a glove,” she murmured to herself. “Maybe I’ll be okay after all.”
“What’s that?” Dale said.
But Dr. Liza didn’t repeat herself.

They’d left the lab an hour ago. The hospital was only five miles away. Yet, they found themselves only halfway there, stuck in unmoving bumper-to-bumper traffic. The reprieve in Dr. Liza’s anxiety, brought on by the various positive aspects of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs, proved temporary. Out of the corner of his eye, Dale had watched her grow more and more upset–first sitting straight up, then tapping her fingers on the dash and sighing loudly.
When she finally spoke, her voice cracked with fear. “It’s no use. We’re getting nowhere. We need to administer the medication now.”
“But how are we going to do that?” Dale said. “The patient is at the hospital.”
“No, I said we need to go to the hospital so they can administer it safely. The patient isn’t there. Not yet. She’s here. Dale, it’s me.”
“What?!”
“Look at me, Dale,” Dr. Liza said. “You’re going to have to administer the drug that’ll save my life from the disease I’ve kept a secret all these months.”
“But, but…”
“There are no buts about it,” Dr. Liza said. She pointed to one of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs. “See that Primula 20oz Insulated Mug? You told me that–with its double walls, vacuum seal, and triple-layer Copper Cold Technology–it can keep liquids hot for up to 8 hours and cool for 24. It makes sense that you’d have such a mug, because you’re a lot like it. You want to save lives. I’ve seen it in your eyes, and like a giant beautiful man-shaped Primula 20oz Insulated Mug, you keep that desire at the appropriate temperature so that it never dies.”
Dale nodded. She was right. He’d waited his whole life for this. Without a word, he got the empty Primula and carefully mixed the contents from the others together in it. “Now, what do I do?”
“It needs to be applied to my lips,” Dr. Liza said. “But first, it requires vermilion stabilization, meaning it must be applied to a healthy pair of lips, and then transferred from those lips to the taker’s.”
Dale understood what he must do. He gravely opened the easy-open, easy-close lid. It was straw-compatible but he didn’t need one now. He let the liquid touch his lips, and then he leaned over the center console to Dr. Liza…

Dale paced. He held a Primula 20oz Insulated Mug. He had cleaned it and filled it with coffee from the hospital waiting room two hours ago when he arrived, and it was still hot.
Finally, the doctor appeared. “She’s recovering,” he said, “thanks to that experimental drug she made and thanks to your administering of it. Still, to be safe, we’ll give her regular doses of it every four hours.”
“And how will you give it to her?” Dale said, feeling strangely jealous. “Do you have a machine for vermilion stabilization?”
The doctor looked at him, confused.
“You know,” Dale said. “It needs to be applied from healthy lips to the lips of the diseased.”
“It’s taken orally, son,” the doctor said. Then a sly grin came across his face. “If I had to wager a guess, I’d say someone has a crush on you!”"	0.05			2018-08-07T04:00:06.333Z	0.5387061168679262	0.92	64187			0.11531935223472428

“Do not cast your pearls before swine.”
People spoke these words without thinking, for a moment, of how they would hurt me, a pig. But more than speak them, they lived by them. Every time I walked into a jewelry store, they quickly rushed to put away their finest pearls.
I told them, “But it is me. I am not a descendent of some clown like Porky. My grandfather built the first ever wolf-proof house. He patented his  special structurally-sound brick-laying technique, and it has been used in the constructions of homes the country over, including three governors’ mansions. He passed his business down to my father who passed it down to me, and now, my net worth is somewhere in the high nine-figures. So please, allow me to purchase the great jewels of the sea.”
Still, I received nothing.
Then, one day, I saw a New Yorker cartoon. One dog sat on the floor, listening to another, seated at a computer. The caption read: “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” For many, it was simply humorous. For me, it was instructive. I realized this was the easiest way to pearl ownership: the internet.
Since then, I’ve made a point to purchase all pearl and mother of pearl jewelry I see for sale online. Truthfully, I don’t even like pearls that much, but I buy them anyway, just to enjoy the warm feeling of a symbolic victory.

You get 2 pairs of Maroo ICE Headphones, but when you receive them, you might think you accidentally ordered 8. Because despite their “smaller fit for women’s ears,” these things come in an unnecessarily big and complicated box. User @Chakolate sums it up pretty nicely:

What is a problem is the amount of packaging. The unopened package is 223 grams, of which 11 grams are the actual headphones. They come in a jewelry-type velvet box, which is nestled in a lot of plastic, which is inside a thin cardboard box, which is wrapped in tissue paper. They also include a carry pouch, and a thick little book about how to use them. (Seriously? They’re kidding, right?) The end package is about 8x3x3"", which is absurd for headphones.

And in case you need some idea of how big that actually is, here’s a picture.

For context, the can next to it is 16 ounces. It’s also a delicious hazy New England style IPA as good as any I had back east from the best brewery in Des Moines! (In case anyone from Confluence is reading and wants to give me some swag.)
Now, you’re probably thinking: “All that stuff for some bedazzled earbuds? What a waste!” But you’re not looking at the big picture. All the various packaging materials are not simply for this product; they’re for a bunch of different things we’ve sold over the course of the last year. For example:


You can cut up the plastic casing and put them in your Ray Ban Eyeglasses when one of the lenses breaks.


You can use the jewelry case to hold your Diamond Encrusted Eternal Heart-Shaped Pearl earrings.


You can use the pouches for safe transport of your WWE TeenyMates.


And you can use the tissue paper when you move to wrap the little espresso cups you got to go along with your Nespresso Vertuo.

Four Blender Bottles probably seems like plenty of Blender Bottles. You have your Blender Bottle, your backup Blender Bottle, a Blender Bottle to try weird stuff in, and a Blender Bottle to give away when your friend is like, “Oh, I should get a Blender Bottle like that.”
Sixteen Blender Bottles is probably too many Blender Bottles. Even if you’re very clumsy with your Blender Bottles, or very experimental, or have a lot of friends who want Blender Bottles, you’re still probably going to end up with a few leftover Blender Bottles.
So why should you get sixteen Blender Bottles?
Because it’s possible that this is the best ever deal on Blender Bottles. You’re probably thinking: sixteen Blender Bottles for $49? That’s about $3 per Blender Bottle. Not bad, right? But it gets even better, because really, if four Blender Bottles costs $20, that means you’re really getting twelve Blender Bottles at $29. So you’re looking at a cost of less than $2.50 per Blender Bottle after the initial four Blender Bottles.
(Which, side note, makes for a great conversation starter. The next time you have some friends over just point to the pile of Blender Bottles in the corner–and there will be a pile of them in the corner; you have sixteen of them, after all–and say, “See that Blender Bottle? That Blender Bottle only cost me $2.42.” Just, make sure you point to one of the last twelve Blender Bottles, not one of the first four Blender Bottles, because as we’ve established, those Blender Bottles cost more.)
With savings like that, can you really pass up buying sixteen Blender Bottles?

The FoodSaver conference room was tense. Nobody knew why the emergency meeting had been called except that it involved “a failure in marketing.”
Finally, Richard, the sixty year old exec who’d sent out the invite, arrived.
“Folks, we’ve got problems,” he said. “Our prized product, the Vacuum Sealing System, is being used for things other than saving food. Which is bad, because that’s our name. One thing they’re using it for is something called ‘Sous vide,’ which I believe is a religion, so we’ll want to be very careful there. But the other thing is–” Richard looked around, and spoke in a hushed tone–“they’re using it for marijuana.”
“They smoke through the machine?” asked Terry, age fifty-two.
“That’s what I thought at first,” Richard said. “But it turns out it’s more for storage and keeping it fresh. Anyway, there’s a whole bunch of people doing it. I found a message board where everyone was snap-chatting about it. The Red Edit.”
“It’s called Reddit,” said the intern, age twenty-one. “It’s the ‘trees’ subreddit.”
“Nope, that’s not it,” said Richard. “It’s definitely not about trees. Your generation wouldn’t understand because your Woodstocks were different. Anyway, we need to cash in on this, and we need to cash in on this NOW. We need a marketing campaign. Something to appeal to the youth.”
“But you just said my generation–”
“Quiet, intern. The adults are talking. Now, let’s spitball a little. What do we got?”
“What if,” said Tony, age fifty-eight, “we do one of those internet pictures and then make it go viral?”
“I like that,” Richard said. “That’s a good plan: a viral internet picture.”
“I’ve seen one particular internet picture,” said Harry, age fifty-eight, “where there’s a man pointing at a butterfly. The man will be labeled, and the butterfly will be labeled, but the man will be saying, ‘Is this a something-other-than-butterfly?’”
“Because it’s labeled as something else,” Richard said.
“No,” said Harry. “I should’ve mentioned that too. He doesn’t call it what it’s labeled, either. He calls it something else. I believe that’s part of the joke.”
“Okay, so,” said Terry, “we label the butterfly ‘FoodSaver’ and the man as ‘consumer’ and he’s asking: ‘Is this a thing for storing my reefer?’”
“Ganja,” said Tony. “Let’s say ‘ganja.’”
“Good catch,” said Richard. “We need to use relevant terms.”
“Also, underneath the question,” said Harry, “it should say, ‘Yes, and you can has it!’”
“That’s with the cat, right?” Richard said.
“No,” Terry said. “Cat says, ‘hang in there.’”
“Well, this has been very productive,” said Richard. “Good work, team. I’ll send this along to the design department. I’ll tell them to redraw the image in case there’s a copyright issue and to get us twelve potential samples by this afternoon.”
“You want the design department to make twelve images in a few hours?” asked the intern.
“Yes,” said Richard.
“But how?”
“They have computers,” Richard said. “It’s easy. And anyway, I don’t tell them how to do their jobs. Until I do. Now, intern, didn’t I put you on a special office sustainability project? I thought you kids love that stuff.”
“You asked me to photocopy a blank piece of paper as a way of saving paper,” said the intern, “but that doesn’t actually make any sense.”
“Look, do you want the college credit or not?”

But already, we’ve messed up. All this talk of “you can get” and “if you want”? Are we crazy? If you’re buying heart pendants online in mid-November, you’re probably not thinking about yourself. You’re buying holiday gifts for others.
But who? Yes, there are plenty of people out there who love jewelry, but these days the gift-giving season (at least in our experience) seems to be less about personal affects and more about technological advancement. You don’t get your mom earrings anymore; you get her a tablet. And you don’t get your grandmother a bracelet; you order her a Roku and help set up Netflix so she can watch her shows on an infinite loop without commercial interruption. So who are you buying this jewelry for?
You might not be able to think of anyone… and that’s exactly the point!
You’re forgetting somebody. Or maybe you’re not. Maybe you didn’t even realize Aunt Gilma was coming this year, after what happened at the Easter Parade. Or maybe you didn’t know Cousin Nick was bringing his girlfriend from college, or that he had a girlfriend at all, or that he was in college, and actually the more you think about it, the less you remember even having a cousin Nick. But that doesn’t matter. She’ll be there for the holidays, and come Christmas morning you don’t want her to have to sit awkwardly on the floor among the landscape of shredded wrapping paper with a big pile of nothing to bring home.
And jewelry is the perfect gift in this situation: a nice, attractive, inoffensive, break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option for that special someone in your life… that you totally spaced on.
In other words, it wouldn’t hurt to just have some around this time of year.
And if you give the pendant to someone who doesn’t like it? Guess what: there’s probably another person coming around for their holiday celebration that they didn’t consider. You know what that is?

Yes, with each day there comes fewer hours of sunlight to warm things up. The numbers you saw on the right in the “low” column have begun their migration left, replacing the previously pleasant “high” temperatures. Thus, this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Maker and travel brewers might, you think, only be used a short time before they go into storage. Because brewing iced coffee in December is like the beverage equivalent of wearing shorts during a blizzard: something done, in states that experience a true winter, only by the extremest of die-hards and season deniers.
As one such person, I can confirm: we are a small, proud, devoted (if not somewhat delusional) group. But we also know a secret that few others seem to understand.
Before I get to that, though, let me clarify. The group I’m talking about is those who drink iced coffee year round. I claim not to know anything about the cold-legged shorts wearers. Although I do wear shorts in the winter months sometimes. For example, if I’m stuck inside and doing something active, like cooking or cleaning.
And this is exactly the secret I’m talking about: winter only happens outside!
Everywhere else, it remains warm enough to drink refreshing smooth cold brew. At home. At work. Even in the car. Actually, especially in the car, after you’ve given it some time to warm up, when it becomes basically a mobile sauna.
What’s funny is that this secret hides in plain sight. Think about it. Do you bake your salads in the winter? Do you pour a bottle of Coca Cola into the kettle and set it to boil? Do you say to the bartender, “I’ll have the IPA, but nuke it on high for 45 seconds”? Sure, a hot toddy, a nice soup, or a steaming mug of hot apple cider is nice. but even in February, these things aren’t as ubiquitous as a glass of cold water and a deli sandwich.
In other words, it’s totally easy to normal to drink cold brew coffee year round. The only tough part is when you walk from the warmth of your car to the warmth of your house or your office with your cold cup in hand.

This MOKCAO POWER+ Cordless Speaker is compatible with the 2nd Generation Amazon Echo Dot, which essentially means this is a vessel for Alexa. She’s called a “digital assistant” but it’s around now, in the fall, where she begins to feel entirely digital and of little assistance.
Alexa can’t rake leaves, and she’s terrible with a leaf blower. Ditto for scraping the frost from your car’s windshield.
You can ask her to help bring the potted plants in from the porch, and she’ll refuse each time, regardless of how polite you are. As if she doesn’t understand SHE works for YOU!
Alexa can tell you the Bolivian city Oruro’s population. She can tell you who serves at its mayor, or what kind of climate it experiences. She can probably tell you its exact coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. But she has no fucking clue where you put your damn sweaters after you moved this past summer.
With certain home systems, it’s likely possible that Alexa could adjust your house’s internal temperature and turn on certain lights at your request. But she is powerless to slow the gusts of wind that keep knocking off the dead branches from the trees in your backyard, or halt the encroaching darkness that aims to devour large swaths of your day.

They say variety is the spice of life, but switching up the spices themselves doesn’t make something entirely new. What’s better: trying an entirely new method of cooking. Take sous vide cooking, for example. Using a slow, rotating hot (but not boiling) water bath to cook your food (which itself is sealed inside a plastic bag) will allow for levels of tenderness heretofore unexperienced.
But as with all things culinary, you should know what you’re getting yourself into. So, instead of spending two-grand on some state-of-the-art sous vide oven that you may or may not enjoy using, try one of these. It will work with any pot and is small enough to be stored easily, while also giving you a taste of what sous vide cooking has to offer.
…is what you can say to whoever you give the second one of of your two Power Precision Sous Vide Cookers to. The real truth is: by giving away one of these to a friend or family member you’re actually giving yourself a gift.
Sous vide cooking is fun. It’s weird. It’s a lot different than most basic cooking methods. And because of that, there are tricks you’re bound to pick up along the way, little ways to improve your food’s flavor, or methods that maybe make it just that much easier.
Still, you’re bound to have some blind spots. Cooking is like having a problem to solve, the problem of how to get all these ingredients into a cohesive “meal.” As such, everyone’s going to come at it from a different angle. And knowing how another person approaches something might help you figure out the best way for you to do things. Thus, by giving your second Power Precision Sous Vide Cooker away to someone you know, you’re basically getting an assistant chef. Or maybe an IRL Youtube tutorial without the terrible five minute intro.
Then again, if you’re giving someone the gift of a sous vide cooker to receive the gift of advice for what you should use your sous vide cooker, you might involuntarily give them the gift of some advice about how they should use their sous vide cooker… which means, you’re only getting one gift while they get two.

Dearest Martha,
I wish I could say that I miss you. Alas, to suffer only a heavy heart would be a great relief! The truth is much worse than that. I write this letter because I am in grave danger, and I fear that I will suffer not death, but something much worse: a living death of sorts.
Yes, “fear”: a word you likely never thought you would see your husband write. For eight months, I cohabited with wild gorillas. For eleven, I roamed with a pack of wolves. For three, I swam with electric eels. I was buried a whole year among the bulldog ants of Australia in an attempt to understand their tunnel structure. Never once, in any of those cases, did I feel even remotely afraid. But none of them compare to this.
Though it may void my contract with the research firm, I will give you the full details of my current assignment: I was sent to integrate myself into a community of EarPod wearers, so that I might discern once and for all what makes them such incredible assholes.
I have, for the last month, been living among them somewhere in the Bay Area in what I believe is an apartment, but also seems to be a concert venue and startup. The startup is focused on an app of some kind but no one here actually programs. They all work as “organic social marketing disruptors” though many also dabble, I’m told, in graphic design. They wear their EarPods always. And so do I.
This is what I mean by a living death, Martha. Since putting the EarPods in, I have begun to have thoughts that seem not to belong to me. At first it was just, PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT on a constant loop. But as I acclimated, I began to think things like It’s too bad the world isn’t as present as me, or My podcast is better than this one, or What idiot called these EarPods instead of Lil’ Listenies? The other day, I thought once again about them falling out, but this time, it was, If these EarPods fall out, what’s going to keep my head from floating away?
Martha, I am losing it. Or: I am losing myself. So please, come quickly. Unfortunately, I am not sure my exact address, so you will have to fly to San Francisco and look for posters for a show we are hosting, featuring a performance by an artist named Transl8. He does electro-folk, as well as politically-conscious trip-hop.
Also, please bring a pair of Rowkin Bluetooth Earbuds. Just as I needed to take measures in order to avoid the bends when I resurfaced after spending those weeks with the angler fish, so must I do the same now. And those Rowkins are stylish, wireless, and way less obnoxious than EarPods. They should return me to myself in no time.
Make haste.

Think of your favorite Christmas mornings growing up: you woke up after barely sleeping, rushed to the tree, and tore open your presents. Then maybe came some reprieve–maybe you ate some pancakes and drank some hot cocoa–after which the real fun started: you spent the next several hours painstakingly assembling a tiny model from even tinier pieces so that it could sit atop your desk forevermore!
Okay, maybe that wasn’t exactly how it went. Probably, you played video games, or with some new action figures or dolls. Maybe you watched some movies on TV, maybe you ate more pancakes, drank some more cocoa, maybe you didn’t get out of your pajamas until four in the afternoon when it was time for Christmas dinner, and maybe you were ready for bed at seven, the calories and the sporadic sleep from the night before combining into a potent sleep aid.
And I wouldn’t blame you if that’s what you chose to do. Because those things are more enjoyable than building a model. But here’s something to think about: are they as satisfying?
Because there’s an important difference here. Yes, you might enjoy a candy bar more than taking a jog. Yes, you might enjoy bingeing ten seasons of some guilty-pleasure thriller on Netflix more than spending the afternoon preparing a five-course meal for your visiting relatives. And yes, you’re probably going to enjoy sitting around on the couch on Christmas overindulging in food, toys, and TV (or for adults: food, booze, and basketball) more than building the tiny model of the Eiffel Tower that you got in your stocking.
But you won’t be as satisfied.
Anyone who’s ever done anything requiring a modicum of will-power and ingenuity–even if only to solve a minor problem of their own making–knows that the accompanying frustration quickly gives way to a more lasting pride. Every deep breath you take all day will remind you of that jog. For weeks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment after making that meal. And while you might regret all of the pancakes and cocoa and movies and Christmas cookies well before December 26th, you will always be able to look at your model and think, with a smug sense of satisfaction, I did that.

Here’s how it works: we give you the claim the product makes, explain why we’re more than a little dubious, and then in the end, we come to some conclusion (if ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ can be considered a conclusion). Let’s get started!
The Claim
CBD is “a natural constituent of hemp” that “has been shown to have positive health benefits.” But since it contains no THC, it won’t get you high. Thus, it supposedly can help treat stuff like pain and anxiety with less risk of endless philosophizing or nachos.
The Skepticism
Here are pretty much all of the things we can definitively say about CBD:

It is short for cannabidiol.

Did we get all that? Does anyone need anything repeated? In the back? Can you all hear me?
Okay, that’s a simplification. There’s more. For example, we also know that, like Hansel, this CBD shit is just so hot right now. According to a New York Times article by Alex Williams, Willie Nelson is launching a line of CBD-infused coffee beans (two of his favorite things in one cup, he says), Mandy Moore is toying with it to see if it helps relieve the pain of walking in heels, and Glamour magazine ran a story with the headline “I Replaced My Entire Beauty Routine With Only CBD Products.” I am linking it here as proof. I refuse to actually read it, which I consider an act of self-care.
But what does it actually… do? Gabe Kennedy a twentysomething CBD start-up founder offers this:

Comparing it to the feeling after an intense meditation or yoga session, Mr. Kennedy added that the CBD glow has “synergistic downstream effects” in terms of social connections. “Around others, I find myself more present and attentive, more creative and open.”

To put my reaction in terms that Mr. Kennedy’s ilk would understand, I’d say the ROI on reading that paragraph was that I experienced an exciting disruption in the mouth sector, which, had I not cupped my hand over my lips, might just have gone viral all over my keyboard.
But while it’s fun to mock the eye-roll parade that the article provides, it also validates the claim made by Christie Aschwanden over at FiveThirtyEight: “the marketing has gotten way ahead of the science.”
Aschwanden is definitely more focused on the what than the why. Her article’s thesis is pretty well summed up by its headline: “Does CBD Really Do Anything?” There are definitely some serious WTF moments in here too. For example, when CBD-pedaling doctor Joe Cohen makes the claim that it has anti-cancer properties and might even help with Alzheimers, Aschwanden raises concern that these effects weren’t discussed in two of the most significant cannabis-focused reports out there. The good doctor’s reply: “I think you just have to Google search it.”
Moreover, though, she raises some important points, most notably that we don’t have mixed messages when it comes to CBD; we have almost no messages at all, because very few tests have looked at it on its own:

Animal models and a few human studies suggest that CBD can help with anxiety, but those are the only conditions with much research on CBD in isolation.

Otherwise, most studies focus on cannabinoids more generally, where they have actually found “‘conclusive or substantial evidence’ supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain in adults, multiple sclerosis-related spasticity (a kind of stiffness and muscle spasms), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”
Though, this assumes you’re getting a real dose, which also seems to be up in the air:

There are no guarantees that the label accurately reflects what’s in the product. For a 2015 study published in JAMA, researchers tested 75 products [cannabis] purchased in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle and found that only 17 percent were accurately labeled. More than half of the products contained significantly lower levels of cannabinoids than the label promised, and some of them contained only negligible amounts of the compounds.

The Conclusion
When we promise something here, we hold ourselves to it, so here comes: after reading about CBD, we can say, conclusively, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . But actually, it seems not to be super risky and to have some potentially great outcomes. So if you’re feeling anxious or a little achy, give it a try. Like most of this stuff, if you don’t think of it as a cure-all, you should be fine."	0.06			2018-11-02T04:00:05.893Z	0.42612956253890216	0.93	66292

It’s easy to come up with jokes about these things, and not just because they’re called “Lovesac Sactionals.” Like, imagine replacing all of a friend’s furniture with these one night, so they awake and believe they’ve grown. Or imagine a business man who uses them in his office as a power move, so that whenever someone comes to meet with him, they have to sit crouched to the ground feeling small.
But really, this hilarious world I’m describing, where everything is out of proportion is actually what young kids experience all the time, just inverted.
As @Superllama7 helpfully points out, “kids and pets can also use adult-sized furniture.” This is true, of course. Yet adult-sized furniture doesn’t really give kids a sense of ownership. Kids have toys and books. They have a bedroom they might share, and a bed to sleep in. But rarely are they given their own little space for quiet comfort in daytime, which is too bad, because it’s something they might like.
@2palms’s daughter did, at least: “with the double-wide seat she can get a leg up, then camp out in the corner with her books.” If that sounds super cute, I’ve got news for you: it is. @2palms includes two adorable pictures of “quiet morning reading time” on one of the 2 “chaise lounges” they put together. (@2palms elsewhere describes the Sactional furniture’s sturdiness, in case that’s a concern).
We should add that this time around, we’re selling them a bit differently than we did in September. Instead of doing it piece-by-piece, we’re offering a few different packages. You can get:
2 Seats, 4 Sides: Great for the kid who will occasionally keep the company of a couple action figures, perhaps a teddybear, but also enjoys a quiet night in with a good (pop-up) book.

That’s ridiculous, Lucy. It’s 2018; you need furniture for casual get-togethers.
8 seats, 10 sides: Basically everything you need to build a simple playpen, except one that’s softer and won’t raise the ire of your interior decorator friends.

Ladies and gentleman, friends and enemies, lovers and fighters, today we offer you something incredible: control of our most essential invisible resource, the very air we breath.
Birds? They are mere riders of the sky, nothing more than hangers-on. Airplanes? For all of their ingenuity, their undeniable feats of engineering, they still must heed the air’s wishes. When the air says, I shall have a massive storm here, in your flight path, does the plane puff out its chest and cry, Not today, air! Your storm can wait? No! The plane says, Ah, yes sir, yes sir, whatever you prefer, air! We shall find a new way to where we are going! And if the air says, The storm will be massive; there is nowhere to go, the plane replies with a nervous laugh, and says, Of course, sir! Totally understandable, sir! Take your time, sir! We will be right down here on the ground if you need us, sir!
In other words, birds are nihilists and planes are weak-willed.
You are neither.
The air might find its way through some unseen passageway into your house in the dead of night, at the height of winter. And it may say to you, Behold my dryness! It may say, Watch, as your knuckles fissure and grow red! Watch as your skin flakes! Watch as your lips chap, even in here, where you thought you were safe from my wrath! It will cackle with bitter delight as it watches you apply lotion and balm, knowing they are like cheap bandaids in the shadow of its vengeance.
Then the air will feel something itself, a chill. But more than that: it will feel the slow in-creep of moisture. It will say, Is there some glitch in your heating and cooling system? And you will point to your Pure Enrichment Cool Mist Humidifier, and you will say, “No, there is no glitch at all.” Then you will say, “Now dance, air!” And it will cry tears of humidity, but it will dance!

I, Clive Grunley, am not a mere athlete. Nor a biathlete. Nor a triathlete or anything so simple. No sir, I am a sexdecathlete, if you know what I mean!
What I mean is I compete in competitions comprising of sixteen distinct athletic feats. Why do you look so surprised? Did you think a sexdecathlete was something else?
A traditional sexdecathlon begins with a twenty mile run (1). Next, is a swim of at least 4 miles (2), but additional miles can be swum to earn tokens which can be used to hire additional bridge builders to help you build the bridge (3) back over the body of water you just swam across.
After that comes the javelin toss (4), followed by a short sprint (5), in order so that you can catch the same javelin you just tossed (6), and then, while holding it aloft, discuss with several gifted undergraduates how the javelin can serve, in literature, as a metaphor for one’s ascension and subsequent decline (7).
This is followed by a water break, which is not a break as in a moment of reprieve, but another event wherein each competitor builds a mold, pours water into it, freezes it, and then breaks the sculpture upon the shoulder of a competitor before they have one broken over theirs (8). Those who lose are disqualified, and given a strong handshake by those continuing on (9).
Next, you chop down a tree (10), then climb at least halfway up the tree (11), and carve some part of the three into a surfboard (12) while it is falling, so that you have something to ride when your tree eventually lands in the wave pool. You then ride a wave (13) to the artificial “shore” wherein a meeting ensues among remaining competitors as to how you might maintain the tree-related events while also promoting sustainability (14).
Which leaves nothing to do but cross the finish line (15) and exchange high fives (16). Yes, these count as events, as the finish line is a moat filled with poisonous snakes and we call them high fives because they must be completed atop a nearby mountain of you and your high-fiving partner’s choosing.
Anyway, the point being: after a long sexdecathlon, I’m beat. And I need at least three Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Packs to sooth my aches. I especially like that the texture provided by the ceramic beads allows for a nice massage. And let me tell you, us sexdecathletes might all be different, but every one of us likes a good rub!

If you’re shopping for yourself, you can get any food processor you want. You can take your parents’ old food processor. You can go to the thrift store, find one, search around for an outlet to make sure it spins, and take that one home. Or maybe you don’t need to go through all that trouble; maybe you just buy it as soon as you see it. If it doesn’t work, oh well! It was only a few bucks.
But if you’re getting someone a food processor as a gift, you need to do a little bit better than that. You don’t want to give your husband or wife or newly married friend something used that you’re pretty sure works. You need to give them something clean, something shiny, something new.
More than that: you need to give them a brand they’ve heard of.

Four truths and three lies about the artist Adam Koford:


Adam Koford, as a shirt designer often under the moniker of “Apelad”, has sold more than 260 designs on websites like Shirt.Woot, including several that this former Woot copywriter often still thinks of and laughs aloud.


Adam Koford’s art studio is in a house boat currently floating in international waters, the only place he can execute his diabolical pencil hold without being taken into police custody.


Adam Koford was, for a time, a jockey. He and his horse Maple Syrup were dominant, winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. On the track of the Belmont Stakes, though, disaster struck. Just feet from the finish line, Maple Syrup collapsed in a cloud of gray smoke, at which point it was discovered Maple Syrup was not a horse at all, but a robot powered, at its center, by a tiny car driving on a tiny treadmill.


Adam Koford is the creator of Laugh-Out-Loud Cats, a webcomic which can be viewed at HOBOTOPIA.com, as well as in a new book, One More For The Road, COMING SOON (stay tuned to Hobotopia for an official announcement in a couple weeks). A few months ago, he posted his 3000th Laugh-Out-Loud cats drawing. And since pictures are each worth a thousand words, that means Koford has produced the equivalent of 3 million words, the equivalent of somewhere between 30 and 50 novels. That’s impressive!


Adam Koford opens bananas by making several exacting surgical incisions with a scalpel. The peel-removal process can take up to two hours, but according to Koford, it’s worth it. “If you respect the fruit,” he says, “it will in turn respect you by unlocking heretofore hidden flavors.”


Adam Koford has worked as a senior writer and story artist on the video game versions of Bolt, Toy Story 3, and Cars 2. Which means he can say things like, “I wrote Toy Story 3,” and not technically be lying!

Many considered A Portal Among The Pages, published in 1978, to be the book that marked science fiction author Hal Pembry’s ascension from merely great into the canon. His previous seven novels to that point had been entertaining and thought-provoking, but few managed to evoke the magic that Portal  seemed to achieve so easily. As one reviewer wrote, “When Finley [the book’s protagonist] first finds the Encyclopedia of Time, he does not know that it functions essentially as a time machine, yet he senses something special between the covers. Readers might find this sensation quite relatable, as they sit in their favorite chair, holding Pembry’s masterwork aloft.”
His fans were eager to see what he would come up with next. And they were profoundly disappointed when the answer turned out to be: nothing. Pembry never wrote another book. In fact, he disappeared altogether. Many assumed he’d gone the way of other successful literary eccentrics–that the fame had been too much for him and so he’d retired somewhere quiet for a life of seclusion. Others posited that the terrible film adaptation had driven him to flee out of embarrassment. A small faction of particularly conspiracy-minded fans put forward a theory of murder at the hands of Kyle Tolliver, a rival author driven mad by jealousy because his own stellar novel’s release had been eclipsed by Portal (this being a pun many newspapers made while discussing the books’ relative sales, as Tolliver’s concerned a deadly solar eclipse).
None of these theories came close to the truth. In actuality, Pembry’s novel was a confession of what was to come: he’d discovered a way in which he could, through literature, bend time. I know because he told me when I spotted him last week outside of a used bookstore in Omaha. He did not look a day older than his author photo from forty years ago.
I asked what he thought of life in our current age and he said, “It’s okay. There are many things that science fiction foresaw, only different in minor ways. There are robots that work for you, but the one’s that move have no personality, and the ones with personality don’t move. They live in speakers and phones. And then there’s that.”
He pointed to the GOTRAX Hoverfly ECO Hover Board I had ridden up on.
“I’ve read all about those. About how their electrical safety is certified, about how they can go nearly 8 miles per hour and up to 12 miles distance before needing a charge. It’s truly a work of ingenuity. Only, when I and many of my contemporaries had imagined hover-vehicles, I thought they would truly hover. Again, it’s not that I’m unimpressed. Sometimes, I wish there was just a bit more whimsy. At any rate, I ought to be going.”
I asked him where and he corrected me. “It’s when,” he said, then told me to name a year. 1919 was what came to mind, and he took out a small unmarked book from his blazer pocket, opened it to a specific page somewhere in the middle. “Ah,” he said. “Interesting.” He pointed to a line written on the page. I tried to lean over and see but in that moment, there came a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew, Pembry was gone."	0.05			2018-10-26T04:00:03.801Z	0.24495605686952773	0.93	63926

We all have our preferences when it comes to luggage. Some of us prefer the hard-sided rolling bag. We like that what we see is what we get, that its shape remains steadfast always. We find comfort in knowing that our things will be safe inside. Perhaps we go on a vacation and buy a commemorative glass; with our hard-sided luggage we can be sure that it will be safe, as long as you don’t pack it too loosely. You don’t have to worry about some other bag in the cargo crushing it.
Others of us prefer the duffel. It’s casual but also classic. It can go down the street to the gym, or across the world to Shanghai. If you don’t have much to pack, it’ll take up less space. You can pack lightly or overpack a little bit. Its soft sides are forgiving. Also: they’re malleable. Pack one full of clothes, and you can squeeze it almost anywhere. It’s like a firmer pillow.
And yet…
There are times when we wish our hard-sided luggage had just a little bit more give to fit in the tight space behind the passenger seat of a fully packed car. And there are times when we’d like trust our duffel to hold its shape just a little bit more. For example, when we travel to wine country in Oregon, we want to bring back a bottle of wine, not a bag full of wet wine-scented clothing and some decorative shards of glass.
In other words: when it comes to bag-style our preference is not as firm as we might think. And facing this knowledge, it quickly becomes clear that the options aren’t hard-sided or duffel. They’re:

We can refuse to choose. We can eschew bags altogether. We can wear all of the clothes we want to bring on a given trip, layered over each other. The top layer can be pair of cargo pants and a hoodie with a big pouch. In the pockets: our toiletries, our travel knickknacks, our phones, etc.

Or…

We can choose both. As in, we can buy one of each: a U.S. Polo hard-sided bag, and a U.S. Polo rolling duffel. If we’re going for ten days at the vase expo, we can bring the hard-sided luggage. If we’re driving across the country and want something that’s easy to roll in and out of motels every night, we can take the duffel. But with both, we always have what you need.

Okay, fine. This is manipulative. If you really want to buy just one or the other, that’s fine too… But know this: some day, you might regret that choice–some day, you might need those hard sides or that soft top–and when that day comes, we won’t be able to help you. Because we’re a deal-a-day site. And we might not be selling luggage that day."	0.05			2018-10-25T04:00:09.038Z	0.19988858668938622	0.94	64860

What you get with other razors is pretty simple: a brand name and a shave. With these razors, we’re obligated to keep the company that makes them a secret. You might think that means you only get the shave, no name. But you actually get so much more! Such as:
A Smug Sense Of Superiority
These other people–nay, these other sheep–wander around, blindly trusting the messages pedaled by our corporate overlords, but not you. No, you’re enlightened. If you could sharpen kale stalks into rustic straight-blade razors, you would. But you can’t. You’ve tried. So you’re left with one other option: unnamed razors purchased on a cheap deal-a-day site. Are they corporately-made razors? Sure. But at least you get to say: “I may not be able to avoid you, but that doesn’t mean I have to like you!”
Potential Podcast Fame
Maybe buying a Gillette razor will give you some peace of mind. But you don’t build a podcast empire on peace of mind. You build it on unanswered questions. You build it information that seems forever on the periphery, always close, but never clear. What we’re saying is, if you buy these razors, it just lead you to launch a wildly popular serialized investigative podcast in order to search out the truth: who made the razors? Can Gillette give you that?
A Possible Connection To A Possibly Award Winning Movie
Will we say definitively that the razors we’re selling here are the same brand and style that Mr. Robot himself Rami Malek used to shave his other-worldly jawline, leaving only the iconic Freddie Mercury mustache for his performance in what just might be the film of the year, Bohemian Rhapsody? No. We won’t say that. But we also won’t definitively say that it’s NOT the same type of razor he used either. Eh?

There’s a double-standard here. If you buy a shirt that’s slimming and shave every day because your facial hair comes in patchy or comb your hair a certain way that looks best with your face-shape, it wouldn’t be considered inauthentic. If anything, it’s the opposite. It shows an intelligence, an understanding of what you have and what works best. Because none of those things are harmful or uncomfortable or particularly time-consuming. They’re just simple steps you take to look your best.
On the other hand, if you try to slow the thinning of your hair–or at least slow the appearance of your hair thinning–that’s considered inauthentic. It’s mocked. Men are told that going bald is embarrassing, but also that covering up baldness is embarrassing. Because it exhibits some denial of reality, a fight against what nature has intended for you.
To which, we reply: Yeah, no shit! And there’s nothing wrong with that!
Maybe at some point, we can all wear ponchos, choosing between three or four each morning based solely on thickness of material. Those who are not going bald will stop cutting their hair, and those who are going bald will allow their hair to recede without ridicule. We will all stop showering, and we will all stop brushing our teeth, and we will cease complaining about the natural odors of our bodies and breath. And if some lose their teeth because theirs are weak, they will drink only nutritional juice of a greenish-brown color, and no one will judge them for it.
Until then, we just gotta do what we gotta do to look whatever way feels best. And if that’s using a hair fiber and locking spray, so be it.
(And P.S., yes: given that we have out spoken against pseudo-science in the past, we did give a healthy amount of side-eye to the marketing copy that claims, “negatively charged Moroccan cotton fibers adhere to positively charged individual strands of natural human hair at the root for a noticeably fuller look.” But here’s the thing: there’s a difference in how harmful it is to say some fibers make your head look nice versus claiming an aligned chakra is the best arthritis medicine, so we’ll let it slide.)"	0.05			2018-10-23T04:00:01.475Z	0.3256555514094781	0.94	62467			0.10346348247905289

When the exorcist arrived, the toy seller was pacing the sidewalk in front of his shop.
“You called,” the exorcist said, “for some assistance?”
“Oh, it’s you,” the toy seller cried. “I was worried you might not arrive in time. Yes, yes. I am in desperate need of your help! Some of my toys, you see: they’ve been possessed!”
“Let me guess,” the exorcist said. “Tiny toy soldiers are mounting a microscopic war against you.”
“No,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s little knights, I’m sure,” the exorcist said. “They ride in upon plastic horses and jab you with their surprisingly sharp lances.”
“It’s not them either,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s certainly dolls and stuffed toys,” the exorcist proclaimed. “Raggedy Annes and Andys, sock monkeys, and teddy bears, all singing ironic songs of friendship while stalking your every move, each brandishing pencils sharpened into shivs.”
“Actually,” the toy seller said, “it’s fidget spinners.”
“Wait, what? Fidget spinners? Seriously?”
“I’m afraid it’s very serious,” the toy seller said. “They just won’t stop… spinning.”
“That’s it,” the exorcist said. “They’re just spinning? Like fidget spinners do? But on their own?”
“Exactly! And I have work to do! But I can’t anything done! Because I’m so distracted by their infernal noises! Some of them even glow!”
The exorcist nodded. “I understand. They glow brightly with the spirits of the dead.”
“Nope,” the toy seller said. “They’re just the LED kind. And they don’t all glow very brightly. They’re pretty hit-or-miss, to be honest. A lot of them are fine, but the lights on some are dim, or out entirely. That’s why we’re selling them for cheaper than the non-LED ones.”
“Okay,” the exorcist said. “I think I know what to do. But I’ll need absolute privacy while I carry out the… um… exorcism. And I’m sorry to say, I’ll need to take the fidget spinners with me. To… ensure they don’t get possessed again or whatever.”
The toy seller did not object. In fact, he hugged him and thanked him with tears and his eyes. The exorcist assured him it would all be okay. Then, leaving the man to pace again on the sidewalk, he stepped into the store. It was true: the fidget spinners were possessed. They spun and spun and spun, until the exorcist said a quick three-word incantation, returning them finally to stillness.

Welcome to everyone’s favorite day: Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, wherein we offer a new shirt or whatever every Sunday until, eventually, we get lazy or forget and it ends! Today’s shirt requires a little more explanation than the others. Basically, it’s the Casemates launch shirt, on royal blue… BUT you get a choice: the original sketchy version of the logo (and that’s sketchy as in sketch-like; not like, “it can’t be trusted”) or a new exciting more geometric-looking logo!
That leaves you with four potential purchase choices:
You Purchase The Classic Design
This the option for people who respect tradition. You want a shirt you can wear each night when you return to your victorian home and settle into your bergère chair to re-read Don Quixote. What’s that playing in the background? Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16, of course. And what’s that you’re drinking? Maybe a glass of 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir, or maybe a Boulevardier cocktail that you’ve been antiquing for a few days in a mason jar in the fridge. It all goes just smashingly with your new (or should we say old?) Casemates shirt!
You Purchase The New Design
Here, we have the modern choice. You’ll look right at home wearing this when you pull your electric car into the driveway of your house, a recent construction comprised, it appears, of only the most jagged of edges. Inside, you’ll ask your digital assistant to play the latest release from your favorite musician, a masked individual from a country far away who makes electronic music that is one step removed from the dial-up modem noise. Then you’ll settle in to read a collection of experimental prose poetry while sitting on a piece of brutalist furniture that might be a couch but also might be an end table; you can’t remember. What you are sure of: how comfortable you feel in your exciting new Casemates shirt!
You Purchase Both
This one goes out to all those who toe the line between classic and modern. You like mid-century modern furniture. You listen to blue-grass covers of new wave songs and new wave covers of blue-grass songs. In short, you appreciate all things: from the old and traditional to the new and innovative. If we may be so bold: this is definitely the best choice.
You Purchase Neither
This choice, on the other hand… well, it’s not really a choice at all. It’s the absence of one. You’ve essentially chosen not to choose. To put it bluntly, you are empty. You see stories about rescue dogs on Facebook and feel nothing. you stand directly in front of the elevator doors waiting for them to open, not because you’re in a rush, not because you think you’re better than other people, but because you haven’t thought at all. Often, you feel as though you’ve forgotten something. Your phone? No. It’s in your pocket. Your wallet? No. That’s there too. Your keys? No again. Really, you have forgotten nothing; instead, what you’re experiencing is the sensation of your being crying out to fill the hole where a soul should be.
Anyway, hope this helps you make your decision! Happy Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, and until next time (if there is a next time)…"	0.07			2018-10-21T04:00:03.298Z	0.49400280593593765	0.94	54240

This is a drone. It does what drones do. It flies around for nine minutes, hovers in the air, etc. @Moose tested it. He said it actually was one of the easiest to fly, and might be the most stable of the ones he’s tried for our site. They could’ve marketed it for that: its ease and stability.
Or maybe they could’ve called it a photo drone or a video drone, because it does have a camera that can take 1.3MP pictures and 720p videos. After all, drones are often used for photos or videos. My pretty basic wedding package featured a video done with a drone. Remember that shot at the end of 10 Things I Hate About You, of the band playing on the top of building while the credits rolled? That shot probably required licensed pilots, a helicopter, crew members, waivers, the works. Now, anyone could make something that looks like that, for, I’d estimate, 5 figures less thanks to drones. Like this one.
And no: a Remake-The-Last-Shot-Of-10-Things-I-Hate-About-You-Or-Something-Like-It Drone isn’t exactly going to move units here in 2018… but it would probably be better than Selfie Drone.
Like, are you fucking serious? The phrase “selfie drone” is verbal ipecac. It takes ingenuity and renders it into an overcomplicated way for millennials to engage in the act that has become synonymous with the self-absorption most other generations (wrongly) know them for.
Still, what annoys me isn’t the how clear it is that this product was definitely named by some old dude thinking he’d discovered a new way to “reach the youth.” It had to be, by the way, because, say what you will about millennials, they at least know what a selfie is, and a photo that you need a drone’s angle to capture is not a selfie; it’s a photo with you in it. There’s a difference.
What annoys me is how reductive it is. It’s a dumb marketing 101. It thinks it’s carved out some entirely new lane in the drone game by catering to the selfie-obsessed among us, without taking into account the large number of people that it would turn off. Like, there are probably folks who arrived at the site today, read the product name, and said, “oh, no way,” and navigated away without reading another word. Or even if they did get further, they might still be thinking, It could be cool… but cool enough to risk my friends seeing a box that says “Selfie Drone” on it in the week before the recycling gets picked up? I don’t know…
That’s what really annoys me. But it doesn’t annoy me that much, to be honest. I mean, there’s a reason we can sell this thing here for $20. And it’s not because it’s a bad drone."	0.07			2018-10-20T04:00:46.966Z	0.34139579152096994	0.94	51885

Dear iRobot,
You’ve done what many companies aspire to do, but few actually achieve. In this stratosphere of success, your company is elite: Xerox, Kleenex, Ping Pong. Your product’s name–the Roomba–is now synonymous with (or maybe even supersedes) the “robot vacuum cleaner.” Congratulations.
And many of us here at Meh have been along for the ride since nearly day one. Yet, there’s something that’s frustrated us over the years: every time we sell a Roomba, we realize the model is slightly different than the previous one, despite looking almost exactly the same. We then dive into hours of research, hoping to solve the mystery of what’s so different in order to help our customers make an informed purchasing decision–only to find, in the end,  something trivial, like the canister capacity being one tenth of a percent larger than before.
What we’re saying here, iRobot, is: help us. Or, help us help you. Why not give every  new Roomba a feature that really STANDS OUT, so that they can be easily differentiated?
For example:


You could make one that says “sorry” whenever it bumps into a wall. An another that cries out in pain whenever it bumps into a wall. And another that recites a poem by Robert Frost in a Mike Tyson accent whenever it bumps into a wall.


Or a model that kisses your ankles when it goes by so that you know it loves you.


How about a Roomba that can take all the crumbs from the kitchen floor and forms them into new snacks for you to serve at your next party?


Maybe one Roomba could feature “pie warmth and texture.” And then the ""Plus ""version of that model could also feature “pie flavor.” And it could just be a pie.


Or what about a Roomba that just came with one completely functional human finger? Is that too much to ask?


Look, iRobot: the sensors, the 3-Stage Cleaning System, the ability to automatically adjust to any floor and navigate around furniture–that stuff is cool and all, but it’s also what we expect. Why not give people something a bit more unique? It would certainly be great for us. And if it’s great for us, isn’t it great for you too?
Just something to think about.
Sincerely,

“Another lame Halloween,” Arthur said. “It’s like, what’s wrong with giving out candy? Everyone around here tries to get too creative. I got the worst stuff.”
“You got the worst? Wait until you see what I’ve got,” Lisa said.

Lisa leaned over and looked. “Are those malt balls floating in it?”

“How is it?”
“It’s okay. There are some point of telling issues. Like, if you’re going to use a retrospective POV, the narrator can’t be surprised by the events as they unfold. Also, some of the fantastical elements frustrate me. I keep thinking: what are the rules of this world?”
“Huh,” Arthur said. “I wouldn’t be much help. I’m a journalist, not a novelist. Or at least I am now that a woman on Church Street gave me this.” He handed a diploma over to Lisa.
“Wow, a journalism degree! From George Washington University! They could be really useful,” Lisa said, “for mopping up the soup!”

Probably, we should lie. We should say that this is practical. We should say something like: you can garden from inside! We should claim something about how, with the success of HBO’s Sharp Objects, wealthy families have a renewed interest in dollhouses, and some of them are even hiring full construction crews to break ground and build them; get the heavy duty equipment your crew needs to beat out the other bidders!
But we won’t. Instead, we’ll look both ways, we’ll lean forward, we’ll gesture for your to lean forward too, and then we’ll whisper into your ear…

Two-for-Tuesday? Where’s the ambition in that? Yes, it sounds nice. But we can’t let alliteration lower our standards. So today, it’s four-for-Tuesday or twenty-four-for-Tuesday (which, I guess is technically alliterative).
That’s right, a choice between four or twenty-four. You know that means, it’s…
ORDER/HOARDER!!!
In these semi-regular sales, we provide two options: one a fair number of things for a good price; the other is an unfair number of things for a GREAT price. So, without further ado, let’s get started.
Today’s product is…
FLEECE BLANKETS!
I don’t know about where you all live, but here, the weather has taken a dark turn. It even snowed yesterday! Which means: it’s time to make a nice cup of tea or cocoa and bundle up under a fleece blanket on the couch with one to twelve dogs and/or cats for the next five months.
THE MATH
The four-pack will run you $14. That’s $3.50 per blanket. Not bad, right? But wait! The twenty-four pack goes for $60. That’s $2.50 per blanket. But wait even more! If the first four cost $14, that means the last twenty cost just $46, which is $2.30 per blanket! Does it make sense to break it down like that? Probably not! But that’s how we do it here on Order/Hoarder days!
WHAT TO DO WITH FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
With four fleece blankets, you can put one on the couch, one on recliner, keep one in the office, and still have a backup to rotate in when one is being washed. Or, store them all in a closet and break them out for a late fall bonfire.
WHAT TO DO WITH TWENTY-FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
So! Much! For example:


You could give them out as gifts to twenty-four of your favorite people!


Or, if you don’t have twenty-four favorite people, give them as gifts to twelve of your favorite people! (You can use the remaining twelve fleece blankets as wrapping paper for the other twelve fleece blankets!)


Send one to each venue on your favorite band’s 24-stop winter tour to show you’re a true fan!


Or, give one to all but four members of the twenty-eight piece Swedish indie pop group, I’m From Barcelona, in case they have to play any cold weather outdoor festivals! If they complain about not everyone getting a blanket, just tell them you’re not the idiot who decided to start a twenty-eight person band!


Use them to build a winter-ready tent in the bank yard! Actually, hell, you’ve got 24 fleece blankets! Build a winter-ready tent mansion!


Interior decorators will tell you that the right lighting can give rooms a soft, warm feeling; we say, why stop at lights? Why not take that “soft, warm feeling” over the top by wallpapering your house with fleece blankets?


See? Maybe twenty-four fleece blankets isn’t so impractical after all.
So, what’s it going to be: are you going to place a boring old order, or are you going to take the exciting first steps to becoming a fleece blanket hoarder?"	0.05			2018-10-16T04:00:03.596Z	0.3410857897640822	0.93	63281

Let’s start off general and work our way into more specifics. Every laptop manufacturer calls their product something different, but a Chromebook isn’t just a cool name. It’s actually a different kind of computer. Laptop Magazine sums it up nicely:

Instead of Windows 10 or macOS, Chromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. These machines are designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with most applications and documents living in the cloud.

In other words, if you live in a cabin somewhere in the mountains, and you have to hike and ski many miles back to civilization to grab a solitary bar of wi-fi, this might not be your best bet. Nor would it be a good option if you’re looking for a machine that can support your career cutting movie trailers and playing the latest computer games. These things are pretty sparse, in terms of power.
But for the rest of us, who pretty much never stray far from the router and who mostly use our computers for checking email, keeping track of things, writing, and organizing: a Chromebook is actually a pretty great, pretty cheap option.
And this one is actually both of those things: we’re selling it for just under $150, and on Amazon it has four stars on over 1,000 reviews.
Yes, if you want to be cynical, you could say: but wait, Meh, this thing came back out who-knows-when, and many of those reviews were written a while ago. And that’s true. BUT 1) there were still five star reviews coming in as recently as August of 2018; and 2) never underestimate the online reviewer. Like, these people self-identify as arbiters of all that is good (and not good) to buy; do you really think they wouldn’t rush to update their review the minute anything goes wrong?
Besides, let’s be totally honest: as much as we like to talk about the forward march of tech, most of us are still using our computers for the exact same things as we did five years ago. New apps come and go, but we’ll always need to make spreadsheets and type up documents and check our email.
Who knows? Maybe it’s a blessing it’s a little older: it might mean it was unaffected by the Gmail redesign. That’d be worth the price alone, if you ask us!"	0.05			2018-10-15T04:00:05.520Z	0.2839675274780344	0.93	64996

Mr. Khool was the coolest teacher at Meh High. He taught an elective called The Mathematics of Skating, a class he only managed to get approved after bringing the principal to a skate park and catching phat air while explaining how each side of a halfpipe was essentially a graph of exponential growth. Now, he was on his way to teach his first session of it when, rounding a corner, he heard stifled sobs.
Narf, hunched next to the water fountain, tried to straighten up when he saw Mr. Khool approaching. “Oh, hey, Mr. Khool. I was just… uh… making sure the fountains weren’t leaking.”
“Sounds like the only thing leaking are your eyes, l’il guy,” said Mr. Khool, crouching next to him. “You want to talk about it?”
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Narf said. “It’s just… well… I feel like when all the other kids ask for stuff, they get it right away. Toothbrushes. Jerky. Fidget spinners. But I’ve been asking for the same thing for years, and nobody takes me seriously.”
“I know what you’re going through,” Mr. Khool said.
“You do?”
“Sure! Being a cool guy is great, but sometimes it’s hard to get people to take me seriously. They think it’s all kick flips and cliff jumps, when really that’s only like 60 to 70 percent of what I do. There’s also a lot of hard work that nobody gives me credit for. But you know what? Whenever I start to feel like maybe it’s time to trade my longboard in for a Prius, I remind myself: there’s a reason progress and persistence both start with p. A friend of mine told me that once. His name was Tony Hawke.”
Narf’s eyes went wide. “Tony Hawk the skateboarder?”
“No,” Mr. Khool said. “This is Hawke with an e. He was Ethan Hawke’s second cousin. We played in a band together in college. And actually he went by Anthony.”
“So do you just call him Tony Hawke so people think you’re talking about Tony Hawk?”
“It doesn’t matter why I do it,” Mr. Khool said. “The point is, it’s a decision I made to call him Tony. And we all have decisions to make in this life. So, are you going to give up, or are you going to decide to keep chasing your dreams?”
Narf stood up. “You’re right! It doesn’t matter that it’s taken this long! I can’t give up now, not for anything!”
“That’s right! So, what is it that you’ve been asking for?”
“A cat shirt,” Narf said.
“Wait, seriously?” Mr. Khool said, getting to his feet. “But you’re Narf. You’re wearing a cat shirt right now. And you wore one yesterday. And the day before that. And actually every other day too. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the same cat shirt twice, now that I think about it.”
Narf slung his backpack over his shoulder. “Sorry, Mr. Khool. I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve gotta get to chem. Thanks again! You really said exactly what I needed to hear!”
“That’s great,” Mr. Khool said. “Although, maybe we need some other designs?”
But Narf was already off and running to his next class.

Douglas, We’re glad you’re here. We can see you’re confused, but don’t worry: all will be explained. You see, when LeAnn said to come home so you two could “take a scenic flight over a pristine lake” together, she was lying. This is an intervention. We, your friends and family–we’re all worried about you, Douglas.
It all began when you bought that Odyssey Stellar NX Drone. You said it was a way to bond with your son. But you didn’t let Trevor use it much, did you, Douglas? Still, it was a fun hobby for you. You liked that it came with a VR headset, so you could see from the drone’s POV. You would fly it, recharge it, fly it, recharge it, all day.
Only after a few months did we start to see the warning signs. You walked into furniture, cursing your legs. You started standing on the dining table to watch television. You called this “a more natural prospective.”
Then there was the mini drone that came with your purchase of the original drone. You started calling it ‘l’il guy,’ then ‘son,’ then finally you named it. It would’ve seemed cute, if you didn’t choose, ‘Trevor,’ the same name as your real son.
Yes, Douglas, that’s right: only one of them is your real son. Because you are not a drone, Douglas! You are a man! You might spend days coming out of drone-prospective for only as long as it takes your Odyssey to charge. You might spend these times with your eyes closed tight, whispering, “it’s a dream, it’s just a dream,” so as not to face the fact that you are a human being, and as such, you are bound by gravity to remain on the ground.
But it’s not healthy, Douglas! You have a family! You have a job! You have obligations! You can’t just ignore them because you have “a new life in the sky” now. It can be a fun hobby, but you’ll never really be a drone, Douglas. You need to start seeing that. And moreover, you need to apologize to all of us for what you’ve put us through. Let’s start with Trevor.

User @alacrity wants one thing and one thing only: a margarita.
When we sold a Copper Cookware set, they wrote:

well, I guess I could serve margaritas in these…

On a two-pack of posture trainers:

it has to be said: these make really shitty margaritas.

For a 2-pack of cast aluminum skillets:

well, I guess I could drink a margarita out of em… but there’s still the salted rim thing.

A coffee maker:

this will make very hot margaritas.

Earrings:

these are absolutely useless for margaritas.

You might notice that these are not all sales from the last few months. No, @alacrity has lived with desire for years. But that will change today. Because today we are selling a Cuisinart Waring Pro Blade Blender.
And yet the story does not end here. What we want to know is: how does @alacrity feel about this?
Will they arrive at the site today relieved? Will they cry aloud, “For many years I have wished for nothing more than a sweet lime-rich tequila cocktail. And at long last, the great Meh has delivered to me a device that shall itself deliver me to my own personal paradise. Thank you, Meh! Thank you so much!”?
Or will they feel some resentment? Will they realize, all too late, that the real margarita was the friends they made along the way? Or, to put it differently: is there any margarita that’s as sweet on the lips as camaraderie is to the heart?
And yet, there remains a fact we have not reconciled: uhh, like, hello? We’ve sold blenders before!
So perhaps we’re misreading @alacrity. Perhaps, they do not hope for their own margaritas at all. Perhaps they seek only to be a sort of margarita-specific town-crier, to stand in the virtual park at the center of Meh and warn all those around them about the dangers of attempting margaritas in products not optimized for margaritas.
And then of course, there is the final possibility: maybe @alacrity prefers margaritas on the rocks.
So what is it? Only time will tell. And by time, we mean: hopefully @alacrity in the forums."	0.05			2018-10-12T04:00:20.860Z	0.34750686103289724	0.94	59130

Watches? I never wear watches. Why would I wear a watch in the age of cellphones? That’s what I say. Because I believe in efficiency. It guides my every waking move, from the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the time I lay down to sleep at night. (That’s the alarm on my phone, by the way. Why have an alarm clock when you have a cell phone?)
But it’s one thing to say you believe in efficiency, and it’s a whole other thing to live by it. I know because I do. To prove it, I’ll run through my average morning:
First thing’s first, I make breakfast. It’s the same every day: spaghetti and meatballs. I have it for lunch too. And dinner. Food is food, isn’t it? Why should I have different foods for different meals?
When I’m done eating, I floss and brush my teeth, then spit into the drain in my shower. Because why have a sink when you have a shower? Is not a shower a human-height sink? Think about that for a second. Anyway, when I’m done brushing my teeth, I wash my hands with shampoo. Soap-products are soap-products, after all! Then I shave, checking my reflection in the mirror–by which I mean, my phone, on selfie mode.
A little bit of leisure time is part of being efficient too. So, before heading out the door to work, I take twenty minutes to relax. I might watch a show (on my phone) or read a book (on my phone). But soon enough it’s time to check the weather (on my phone). To confirm the app, I look out the window–the single window I have in my whole house. Why do I need to see out my house from so many different sides? Outside is outside, no matter what way you’re looking at it. One window is plenty.
Using this information, I decide what I’m going to wear: pants or shorts. I should elaborate; it’s the one garment, but it’s got a zipper so I can unzip them at the knee when it gets warm. It’s the same pair I wear every day, because again, for me it’s all about efficiency. Not everyone is a fan of this. My sister, for example, once said she actually hated my zip-on pant-shorts. She said I should switch things up by wearing something else sometimes. She said that by wearing them I was ruining her wedding. Can you believe that?
She hasn’t spoken to me since then, but I don’t mind. I still have another sister, and honestly, at the time, I was in the middle of a painful decision of which sister I would keep. Two sisters? Are you crazy? Who needs all that in your life?
Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh, right: these watches. Yep, don’t need them. Although, they would go nicely with the one sweatshirt always I wear, especially on days when it’s hot enough that I have to roll up the sleeves. And if you’re wondering why I don’t just take it off, it’s simple: I’m not wearing anything underneath. Wearing a shirt under what is essentially another shirt?

Imagine for a moment you’re a secret agent. You’ve been called upon to infiltrate a very important party held by a tycoon with designs to take over the world. You need to take a video of the party, so key attendees can be identified, and hopefully sneak into the study where you’re told the plans for the doomsday device are kept. For this mission, you’ll be provided with a PogoCam. It’s smaller than a tube of lip balm, attaches magnetically to your favorite pair of glasses, and shoots 5 megapixel photos and 720p HD videos. You just need to go to Q to collect it.
FYI: in this imagined scenario, Q refers to the dumpster behind the Qwikmart convenience store down the block, not the genius gadgeteer from the movies. Because, boy oh boy, would that guy steer clear of this thing.
In fact, over on Amazon the PogoCam only has 2.5 stars. That’s some real ruh-roh territory, especially given most products fall into a 3 star rating just by being delivered. People who bought it without the Pogotrack sunglasses offered here griped about the safety loop required when using your own pair.  Others complain about the picture quality or that it only takes 30-second video clips.  One user goes even further: “while I have little proof,” LE says, “[I] believe PogoCam has been the cause of much of the world’s turmoil lately.”
Not great!
But here’s the thing: since it’s come out and been revealed to be of less than desirable quality, the PogoCam’s price has tanked. In fact, I’m told that at one point is retailed for as high as $150. That’s nuts. But even with all those price drops, it’s still just shy of 50 on the 'zon.
We’re selling it for $24. For that price, it can just be a fun little gimmicky impulse buy. Wear it once or twice and you’ve pretty much justified the purchase. If you get it to work better than a bunch of Amazon reviewers and find some real use for it, awesome! If not, at least you got some sweet magnetic sunglasses out of the deal.

“Well, sir,” the engineer said, “I like to think of it like this: by adding a number of attention-grabbing but ultimately unnecessary and overcomplicated ‘smart’ features, we’d only introduce the possibility for bugs and glitches. Not to mention we would have to put out different models for different phones and tablets. So, despite how it may seem, this is a ‘smart’ product, in that simplicity is smart, because it leads to ease of use and universal compatibility.”
The CEO pounded his fist on the table. “I like that! I like that a lot! Not smart is actually smart! That’s great! That’s gonna help me a lot, not just at work, but also in my personal life!”

We’re entering the time of year when everything freezes and dies and allergies are replaced by a sense of tired dryness. For some of you, this might be a relief. And yet, consider these two things: first, said dryness does nothing to dry up non-seasonal allergies, like those related to pets; and second, spring will be back sooner than you think with its pollen-thick air. And just like the smart shopper buys next year’s wrapping paper the day after Christmas when it’s marked down to nothing, so too does he or she purchase an allergen-optimized vacuum just as allergy season winds down.
And boy oh boy, does this thing suck up allergies. In fact, it “captures and traps 99.9% of dust and allergens down to 1 micron.” As a non-allergy-sufferer myself, I don’t know exactly what that means. I can tell you that, given the the word “micron” is pretty much just “micro” with an n, it sounds pretty small.
What I actually CANNOT understand is what the fuck “MultiFLEX Technology” is. I know that it “provides flexible reach for under furniture and freestanding, compact storage.” But what does that mean, exactly? Digging a little deeper, I found that the “MultiFLEX wand bends so you don’t have to, reaching under low lying furniture with ease.” So, apparently, it’s a kind of semi-flexible wand? That’s it? Seriously?
But friends, I’m not mad. No, not at all. In fact, I think it’s smart. Genius even! Every feature of every product, regardless of how mundane, should get the marketing-speak treatment. For example:

Yes, on one level, the design is simple: it’s the Meh face, or should we say, the many (meh-ny) Meh faces you see when you come to our site. It’s a button. You press it. You keep a streak going, if you want. Or else you don’t; you reserve the Meh button only to show your nonplussedness. It’s something that makes our site special, a little inside joke among you, the customer, and us.
But, on another level, the design means so much more. It’s a tribute. To us. And all we’ve done for the world of commerce. Before we came along, all was excitement, and much of it was false. Companies didn’t know that it was fine enough to be, well, fine enough. Everything had to be glorious and exuberant. But then we showed up, and we taught people that it doesn’t always have to be that way. You don’t have to worry about moving the proverbial needle. You don’t need to dial it up to a ten. You can hang out at a five if you want.

In this bundle, you get a power bank and a dual USB travel charger (meaning a wall charger with two USB ports). It’s pretty simple, except for one wrinkle, which is that you get to choose what capacity power bank you want: 4200, 6000, or 9000 mAh. Now, most modern phones can be fully charged with between 2000 and 3000 mAh, which means even the smallest power bank we’re offering can charge your phone somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times. By that standard, you could get 2.5 to 3 full charges with a 6000 mAh power bank, and 4.5 to 5 with the 9,000.
But look, we’re not going to spend the next few hundred words talking math. It’s too abstract. The most helpful thing to do would be to provide brief profiles for who might require each power capacity, so that you identify yourself among them. Here goes:

You’ve got a full day ahead of you, enacting archaic rituals and making shady transactions in a number of parks in and around Cincinnati. And let’s just say the Corrigans didn’t factor in any time for you to stop and juice up your phone. Which is a problem, because you need to be face-timing the entire time so they can be sure you don’t call the cops. In short: you’re gonna need some serious recharge power.

You find that you have an intense desire to work out. You go running and clock 18 miles easily. The next day you go further. And further after that.

You’re afraid that if it does, this will all come crashing down. And yet, you’re always setting off on some new adventure. You don’t get a chance to charge that often.

I said YES!!!” or “It’s a healthy baby girl, 7 lbs, 12 ounces!” And you’re responding, “k,” because even typing out a simple “congrats” would take about twenty minutes. And you don’t have that kind of time. Because you’re at a red light. And you’ve gotta look down at the directions you printed out from MapQuest.

Each year, representatives from all 50 European countries gather for the EuroSock Summit to discuss potential changes to the sock’s age-old design. Here is a summary of year’s Summit, which took place in Luxembourg in a chamber deep inside the Grand Ducal Palace:


The representative from Sweden proposed changing the design, so that the sock appeared strangely both modern yet antiquated, like a torture device, but also attractive and entirely comfortable. Motion failed to pass by a vote of 11 to 39.


The representative from Italy proposed making the next EuroSock as soft as the richest pillowy ball of burrata, as delicate to touch as the most sumptuous pluck-able leaves of basil, and yet as firm as tagliatelle cooked to a perfect al dente. Also: more garlic. Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 19 to 31.


The representative from France proposed making the sock from a distinct material that would grow delightfully crusty over night, so to it could be enjoyed the next day. There was some confusion over this, but eventually the representative from France admitted she was simply hungry, having been disappointed in her hotel’s bread options that morning at breakfast. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Norway proposed making the sock seven times thicker. When someone suggested he have multiple pairs of socks–some for summer, others for winter–he smiled and nodded, saying, “Yes, exactly! These would be for summer!” Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 3 to 47.


The representative from Ireland proposed making the socks out of a darker fabric, one “as pitch black as a Guinness.” The representative from Belgium chimed in to add that the fabric should be strong, “not unlike a delicious quadrupel.” The German representative also leaned forward to propose adding a pinch of sea salt, “one of the key ingredients in a traditional gose.” When they all three broke down laughing it became clear that they’d partaken in a few of the aforementioned beverages during the break for lunch. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Lithuania proposed shelving sock-talk for a bit. Instead, she suggested, maybe they should open some rakia, grappa, limoncello, champagne, or what have you and join their Irish, Belgian, and German compatriots, who were obviously having the best time of anybody. Motion passed by a vote of 50-0.

When I first saw that we were selling an air fryer, I was torn.
On the one hand, Wirecutter pretty emphatically stated that they don’t recommend these things for how expensive they are. If you’re not familiar with Wirecutter, they’re basically one of the best and most straightforward resources for when you’re buying kitchen appliances, electronics, and just about everything in between. They do a lot of research and provide simple, easy-to-understand articles replete with concrete purchasing recommendations. So, their opinion carries a lot of weight.
On the other hand, my dad has an air fryer and he likes it.
Two venerable sources. Two contradictory opinions. I didn’t know who to trust. So I began to dig deeper. Here’s what I found:


While working on his Wirecutter article, Michael Sullivan conducted more than 35 hours worth of air fryer tests. In the end, he was so unimpressed with them that he recommended buying a simple convection toaster oven to get a better bang for your buck.


Back when I was in high school, my dad used to change my car’s oil. Not just check it, mind you, but perform a full-blown change. He had a little pit in the garage, so you could pull your car right in and he’d take care of it every 3000 miles.


Given those two facts, I came to the following conclusion: it was possible that my dad had also used his air fryer for 35 total hours, yet it was very unlikely that Michael Sullivan had ever changed the oil in my car when I was in high school. This seemed like a pretty clear “checkmate” situation. But then I remembered that an air fryer’s greatest selling point is its oil-free frying. Thus, it only seemed fair that all oil-based arguments need be discarded. I found myself right back at square one.
Then it hit me: my dad is a Meh customer. He likely bought his air fryer right here on this very site. Meanwhile, Wirecutter suggests a model that retails at about $250, which is FIVE TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS ONE. Furthermore, they never say they’re outright bad; they just say they aren’t worth the money. Which makes sense: my dad would likely not be the satisfied air-frying customer he is today had he been required to fork over more than 200 bucks.
Therefore, Wirecutter, I know we’ve suggested this before, but if you’re reading this, consider an addendum to your initial verdict of “Not recommended”: something like, “unless it’s selling on Meh for almost a fifth of the cost, in which case, go to town.” I’d be happy to put you in touch with my dad if you need any more information."	0.05			2018-10-03T04:00:13.622Z	0.4058992852291472	0.92	65054		0.15524434813545068

In the grand scheme of things, I’m pretty smart about health stuff. No, not necessarily among other humans. I mean in the REAL grand scheme, as in: among all living creatures in the world. I sometimes eat too many donuts, or drink so much coffee that I give myself a headache. But I at least KNOW what I’ve done immediately after I’ve done it. And compared to my cats or my dog, I come out looking like a friggin’ genius!
For example, I won’t find my way into the trash and attempt to consume a giant wad of paper towels that were used to soak up frying oil, only to slink behind the couch and embarrassedly vomit it up. And if I found myself stuck in a bathroom, I would wait patiently until someone got home and ask them for some help. I would not, under any circumstances, try to EAT MY WAY OUT, causing enough damage so that both the door and the trim need to be replaced, and giving myself a pretty rough tummy ache along the way. Another point in my favor: I understand the utility of pills as well as the ease with which they can be taken. They don’t need to be hidden in cheese or loaded into a little plastic contraption to be shot deep into my throat in order to induce swallowing. I just take them!
And yet, even as I type these gloating words, I’m sitting in a rickety wooden chair, leaning awkwardly over my laptop. Unlike the damage of a few too many donuts or a bit too much coffee, I won’t feel the effects of my bad poor posture for many years. And yet, I know this, but I do nothing to correct it.
In a way, poor posture is like the human version of eating out of the garbage. We just can’t help it. Instead of taste-testing rotten meat or chewing on plastic bags, we hunch. And just as pets need help learning what they should and should not do, often for their own good, so do we.
That’s where this this Posture PT Confidence Corrector comes in. It can fit onto just about any chair–from office chairs to the driver’s seat of your car–and it improves posture, which in turn strengthens your core and reduces lower back and shoulder pain. Or, to put it differently, it’s not unlike a spray that makes bad posture smell like sour apples!
Okay, that’s going a little overboard with the pet metaphor thing. It’s not a spray. It’s a posture corrector. Sorry for the confusion. Now buy one, and straighten out your life. Got it?"	0.05			2018-10-02T04:00:03.835Z	0.31486252125742953	0.93	62431

Today’s sale leaves us conflicted. On the one hand, this would seem like an Order/Hoarder sale: you’re given options, some more reasonable than others. On the other, it’s not exactly the same as past Order/Hoarder sales we’ve offered. For example, there are more than two options. So, if you don’t mind, we thought we could work through this together, with a little Q&A:
How does the math break down?
This is a little more complicated than usual. You can get a 40 pack of basic fidget spinners for $14 ($0.35/spinner) or a 40 pack of LED fidget spinners for $16 ($0.40/spinner). But you could also get a 160 pack of both LED and basic fidget spinners (an 80 and 80 split) for $34. Which is about $0.21 per spinner… except, if you think about it: the first 40 basic spinners cost $14 and the first 40 LED spinners cost $16, which adds up to $30. So that’s a mere $4 for the last 80 fidget spinners, or a nickel per! CRAZY!
So then why wouldn’t this be an Order/Hoarder sale?
For three reasons:


As mentioned above, it’s not an either/or. There are three options.


40 fidget spinners will already have you well on your way to hoarding fidget spinners; but, more importantly…

Because fidget spinners are fun and will last longer. Also, this site is run by someone from Saint Louis where some people give out jokes instead of chocolate, so it’s kind of on brand for us to eschew the national standard for Halloween practices.
Wait, back up: what even ARE fidget spinners?
They’re goofy little spinny toys with no real purpose other then to be fidgeted with.
That’s sorta dumb, isn’t it?
You might think so, but in a world where people try to sell peppermint-scented oil as an alternative to physical therapy, I find it refreshing that there’s a product out there that’s explicitly for useless goofings-off.
Hey: fidget spinners. Halloween. Did I see that on the forum?! Is this the third day in a row that you’ve sold something someone suggested you sell, after making a big show about how you don’t take requests on Saturday??

Okay, so, we know how this looks: we go on a rant yesterday about how you can’t just post on the forums and get us to sell whatever you want… then the next day we sell exactly what you’ve been posting about on the forums. Doesn’t really help us reinforce our standing as definitely-not-pushovers.
But really, we’re trying to teach you a lesson. Because you may think that this is what you want, but are you sure? Like, are you REALLY sure?
You might think you want a shirt. And you might purchase one of these–showing the Meh or the Mediocre logo in glossy black ink on a black shirt, a “stealth” logo, if you will–and you might feel satisfied. You might feel a surge of something each time you put it on, a warmth rising in you that you will recognize as not just comfort… but comfort mixed with a sense victory.
You might wear the shirt proudly at first: to work, or out to grab drinks with friends, or when you’re on vacation, or when you’re visiting family. The people around you might ask, “Who made that shirt?” And you might respond: “Meh.” But really, you’ll want to say: “Me. I made it. Or I made it possible. Because had I not badgered them, had I not joined forces with @reclaimercube, the great bringer of the brush, there is a chance–nay, there is a certainty–that they never would have sold this or any shirt ever again.” And you might beam inwardly to yourself.
But many years from now–long after the shirt has got through the cycle: from wear-it-whenever-you-can, to wear-it-sometimes, to laundry-day-only, to pajama-top, to lawn-mowing-shirt, to rag, and finally to trash–you might be driving down a desolate midwestern highway, listening to a true-crime podcast, and you might suddenly remember: all the time you spent on a deal-a-day site’s forum rallying to spend ten dollars on some silly shirt. And you will wonder to yourself: was it really worth all that effort?
And knowing you people, you’ll be like: HELL YEAH! And that’s why we love you.

On September 13th, user @djslack offered up a list of potential things we could sell, including “some kind of interesting jerky type product.” And so here we are selling delicious Wicked Cutz jerky!
Now, we need to make two things clear:
First, this is some pretty classy jerky. Therefore, the price tag isn’t going to be exactly in line with the Slim Jim that you buy on a whim as you check out at the grocery store, only to open it in your car and for the noxious smell to make you regret your decision, although not enough to stop you from eating it. Hypothetically speaking. Point is: this is good jerky and good jerky costs money.
Second, and more importantly: we need to make something EXCEEDINGLY clear. We saw @djslack’s suggestion and considered it, but the decision to sell the jerky ultimately came down to us and us alone. In fact, there’s a chance that we subconsciously were thinking about selling jerky and so @djslack didn’t exactly give us the idea as much as surface it.
What we’re saying is: we’re not necessarily in the business of outsourcing our product selection. As in, we don’t do requests. As in, don’t get used to this, okay? Because this is it. The party ends here.
We say this because ever since we sold some toothbrushes as a joke–that’s right, it was a joke! A joke ON YOU!–we know there have been rumblings on the forums about something you’d like us to sell. That’s how obstinate we are, people: we won’t even name the item. We won’t even write the word. Because we are unmovable.
We’re like a brick wall. People always tell us that. They say, “Talking to you all is like talking to a brick wall.” Which we take as a compliment concerning our strength. And also our attractiveness, given that brick is a very beautiful building material. In certain cases, at least. Maybe not in some of the suburban architecture of the mid-fifties. But then again, those homes have a certain nostalgic beauty in a way. There’s a pure American warmth to them, isn’t there?
What were we talking about? Right: how we’re not a bunch of pushovers, and you can’t boss us around and tell us what to sell!

No, we’re talking about going even further towards singularity. Not just one deal each day. One entire new site selling only one thing per day.
Here’s how it would work if we were launching today. The site would no longer be called Meh. Instead, it would be called something like FLASH! Or, maybe, ILLUMINATR. We’d have a video about flashlights, perhaps a podcast interviewing flashlight experts on the ins-and-outs of responsible flashlight ownership, and then a lengthy write-up explaining the different scenarios in which you might use a telescoping light with a strong magnet, a small cree light with an adjustable beam, and a solar powered light.
There’d be a new logo each day, and more importantly a new URL.

As well as new hires.
Because we would essentially need to build an entirely new team, wouldn’t we? Otherwise, it’d just be a gimmick. And besides, I don’t want a flashlight expert telling me about trowels or copper pans or robot vacuum cleaners. No, we’d have to start from scratch every day. And in the event that something sells out, we’d probably have to have another site. A site of nothing. A sort of meditative anti-consumerism zen space with no purpose aside the absence of all shopping. Which would also need a whole new staff. That would need to be hired midday and let go by the next morning…

Dearest Professor Alba,
First off, a hearty congratulations on winning the Henning Prize. Your self-adhering bow-tie is certainly a masterwork, and the award is absolutely deserved. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the ceremony. As I am sure you are aware, since my expulsion, you are my sole correspondent from the Meyer Institute of Alchemic Fashion. But my choice not to attend is not due to some fear of seeing my former classmates and teachers again–or, more accurately, of experiencing their fear as they witness me. No, I cannot attend because I have fallen ill, and I fear this may be the last letter I ever write.
Although, perhaps ‘fallen ill’ is a simplification, as the illness under which I suffer has no name.
The trouble began in my makeshift lab late one night. I was working on a new stitch technique, making minor tweaks to it here and there over the course of several weeks. It was going nowhere, and after one particularly long day toiling in the haberdashery (with no Meyer Certification, I am forced to do such menial labor), I came home so exhausted and angry that I decided to throw it all away in favor of something entirely new.
I am sure you will be disappointed to hear this. During my expulsion hearings, you were the strongest voice in my favor. When the administration said that I “endangered” all those around me with the “diabolical recklessness” of my work, you told them it was just a phase. But Professor Alba, it was not. And while I am not proud to admit that, I am also not exactly not proud either.
For that evening, in my lab, I created something amazing: a stitch unlike any other stitch; a stitch that seemed to take time into it, that seemed to steal tiny slivers of the universe’s fabric and convert them into pure style. It was a stitch that resembled a stitch in only an ethereal way, like a word in another language whose definition we can on some level understand but for which there is no direct translation. I sewed up some pairs of socks with the stitch; despite using bland monochrome fabrics, each pair came out patterned with a bold unpredictable design.
I learned all too late that it was taking something from me as well, that it was essentially draining my life energy, weaving it among each sock’s seams. I fashioned a lead coat to wear while working, but it was too late. The damage has been done. I write this letter to you from bed, Professor Alba, a bed from which I fear I may never again rise. Indeed, just the act of writing has left me pale and exhausted.
But this is not a letter merely bidding farewell to you and this world. You will find, in the envelope, the detailed plans for the aforementioned stitch (as well as for the protective coat). I cannot say what I want for you to do with them. Some days I hope you will set them aflame and think of them no more; other days I hope you will use them to start a line of vibrant and delightful socks to sell around the world.
But, Professor Alba, promise me this: if you choose the latter, make sure to warn the people, to let them know the truth, that these are not simply stitched socks.
With Eternal Gratitude,

Step 3: Apply blanket to lap and/or legs.
Step 4: Apply purring cat to blanket at lap area. Pet cat occasionally.
Step 5: Apply hand to remote; locate a binge-worthy show on your television; press play.
Step 6: When your significant other or roommate enters the room and asks if you’re really going to spend all day just sitting there watching television, sigh and say, “You’re right,” then move (very slightly) to get up, stopping only to hiss with pain and grasp at the injury area where the first aid was administered. (Optional: parlay sympathy, if shown, into your significant other or roommate bringing you a hot beverage of your choice: coffee, tea, cocoa, or apple cider.)
Step 7: When your significant other or roommate leaves the room, replace purring cat (if riled by your attempt to get up), rewind show as needed, and resume viewing.

Overview: Very good, but not as good as Michael Keaton!!!
Before I get into my review, I want to give you a little bit of background: I’m a huge Michael Keaton fan and a software developer. Recently, I sold my start-up to a large tech conglomerate for several million dollars. I used that money to build a bunker inside an abandoned warehouse where I would live and wait for Michael Keaton to arrive so I can ask him a few continuity-related questions about his seminal 1996 comedy, Multiplicity, for my podcast: The Podkeast. I won’t list the questions here because I am certain they’ve never been asked and I want to be sure I’m the ones who asks them (more on this below, when I get into the complaints).
I need peace in my bunker to record episodes of The Podkeast and also to meditate and prepare myself for the eventual interview. Luckily, it’s soundproof. That brought up another issue, though: if I can’t hear anything, how will I know when Mike (that’s what I call him in my head sometimes) has arrived?
That’s where The Lynx 1080P Camera comes in! The quality’s great, they’re easy to set up, there’s free cloud storage, and most importantly, it has facial recognition. Using photos, I trained mine to only recognize one face: Michael Keaton’s. Thus, I’ll get a check-in notification whenever he arrives (fingers crossed, any day now!). Any other unfamiliar face alerts that come through I just ignore, because like I said, I don’t need the distractions.
I should say: I do have two complaints. One is that the Lynx recognizes faces really well, but not always the material said faces are made of. What I’m getting at is that my mom keeps showing up in a really realistic Michael Keaton mask (she probably bought it with the start-up money I gave her, ugh!). She always says the same thing: that she’s worried I might be losing my mind. It makes me want to scream. Like, of course I’m losing my mind! I got a check-in notification and thought Michael Friggin’ Keaton was here! And sometimes I do scream. Hey, it’s a sound-proof bunker, gotta get your money’s worth, right?
The other complaint I have is that Michael Keaton has not shown up to do the interview with me. This is probably more a don’t-have-Michael-Keaton’s-contact-info problem than a Lynx problem, but still: with that AND the mask issue, I didn’t feel right giving it five stars.
Overall, though, a very good camera!"	0.05			2018-09-24T04:00:11.601Z	0.2044531578210335	0.94	74861

When it comes to celebrating milestones, different people demand different amounts of ceremony. Some will require you to wear tuxedos and dinner gowns to the their wedding in a restored factory-turned-theater-space, wherein they will prepare a choreographed song and dance commemorating the various defining moments of their relationship. Others will go to the courthouse, sign a few documents, and send a text imploring you to meet them for beers later.
Whether it be a birthday, a successful defense of a PhD dissertation, or a housewarming party–everyone’s a little different. Not everyone wants gifts. But herein lies the one consistent rule, regardless of an event’s formality: if you’re bringing a gift, you have to put it in something festive. Because even the most casual soon-to-be mom isn’t going to stoked when you show up with a onesie still in the shipping box from VintageOnsiesRUs․com.
The problem? Wrapping is stressful. Wrap a gift poorly and you look like a degenerate. Wrap a gift too ornately and you seem like a bit of an over-achiever. Besides, not everything is easy to wrap. If you want to wrap an overstuffed plush starfish, you can either a) put it in a box and wrap that, or b) get your friend who’s an aerospace engineer to help you get the measurements and scissor placement just right so that it doesn’t come out looking like garbage.
Really, your best bet is to put that overstuffed plush starfish into a gift bag. Because the gift bag always looks good. It’s as fun-looking as wrapping paper and as easy as a shipping box. Plus, getting a gift in a gift bag rules. You’re basically getting two gifts, one of which you’re more than encouraged to regift later when you need to give someone else a gift.

For those are unfamiliar, Order/Hoarder is when we offer you two options: a normal number of things for a good price, or an abnormally large number of things for a GREAT price. Today’s product:
Cooling towels!!!
So, let’s break it down:
The Math
“You can’t put a price on cool.” That’s something someone said in a movie once. It doesn’t matter who or what movie or if I just made it up, because it’s not true. You can put a price on being cool.
For example, if you just want to be double-cool (as in, get two cooling towels) you have to pay $12. That comes down to the totally reasonable per towel price of $6 (especially considering they’re $10 over on Amazon).
Now, here’s where it gets a bit more complicated. As we like to point out on these sales, when figuring out the price per unit of the Hoarder order, it’s not as simple as dividing the overall price ($36) by the number of units (12). BECAUSE, your can choose either 2 or 12, no in-betweens. Therefore, if you think about it, you’re already paying $6 for each of the first 2 towels, which means the last 10 towels are only costing you $24, or a mere $2.40 per towel! How about that deal, huh?!
What you can do with a normal order
It’s pretty simple. Cooling towels are not exactly all that, well, cool, but they are functional. With just two of them, you can use one as your main post-workout cool-down towel, and give the other to your spouse or partner. Or you can cycle through both yourself so you don’t have to do laundry as often.
What can you do with a Hoarder order
So much more! Here are just a few suggestions:


Go a day early and leave a cooling towel at each mile marker of your upcoming 20K race, so you never have to worry about getting too hot.


Take all of them and fashion them into a suit or cocktail dress to wear to outdoor weddings. But would a suit or dress made out of cooling towels really be classy enough for something like that? you might ask. To which we would respond: Could it be any less classy than a suit or dress soaked with sweat?


Sure, you could spend a bunch of money on an air conditioner and then a bunch of more money each month to run it. Or, you could save some cash by sewing yourself a delightful cooling towel quilt!


They’d make a great napkin alternative at your 12-guest “super spicy food banquet”.


Are you a do-gooder teen? Do you often dream of fashioning rope ladders out of clothes and blankets to lower yourself out your 2nd story bedroom window so you can run around after bedtime with your new rebellious friends? Only, your palms get so sweaty that you can’t get a good grip? Gosh, if only you could make a rope ladder out of something cool and soothing to the touch!


See? Maybe we were wrong. Maybe 12 cooling towels isn’t an unreasonable amount of cooling towels at all. On the other hand, you still have the option of buying the (completely boring) 2-pack. The decision is yours!
So what’s it gonna be? Are you going to place an order? Or become a hoarder?"	0.06			2018-09-22T04:00:05.871Z	0.20048520789810637	0.96	62757

Generally, we don’t support the silencing of artists. Except here, where you can use Karaoke Creator to suppress the vocal frequencies of a song (and shift the key) so one of your friends can do a much shittier rendition of it.
Crossfader lets you transition seamlessly from one song to the next.
It also has something called “Party Thruster” which involves sliding a “throttle” that allows you to “hear the party build up until you hit maximum party at which time the system booms and the lights go crazy.”

We have no complaints about this LG Hi-Fi Entertainment & Karaoke System.
Honestly, it seems pretty cool. With 1000 watts, it’s got plenty of power. Plus, it’s got a wide range of features that’ll help you “pump up the party” as the youth say. For example, the Crossfader allows you to blend songs together seamlessly. And the Karaoke Creator can suppress the vocals of a given track and then shift the key to one that better suits the karaoke singer.
It also has something called “Party Thruster” which allows you to “hear the party build up until you hit maximum party at which time the system booms and the lights go crazy.” If you’re unsure of what that means, maybe this, from the instruction manual, will help paint a clear picture:

Sounds like a pretty quick party if you ask me, but I’m told it happens to a lot of guys.
So again, we have no complaints about this particular karaoke system. Our complaint is about karaoke in general, or, to be more specific, about the musical artists we so often choose NOT to sing. That’s right: I’m talking about birds. Despite being nature’s original songwriters, you rarely hear anyone at a karaoke night sing a song by the many great bird-fronted musical groups out there, such as:

Oriole Speedwagon,
Cardi(nal) B,
Chirp Trick,
The Coo-Coo Dolls,
David Crowie,
Squawking Heads,
The Beaksie Boys,
The Sparrowling Stones,
Nine Finch Nails,
Pengwen Stefani,
Red Hot Chili Pipers,
Macawl McCartney,
Fowrener,
Kendrake Lamar,
The Flamingo Lips,
Ibis Markie,
Kelly Larkson,
Kingphisher,
or The Killers (of Worms & Field Mice).

It’s ridiculous, really! These are some of the greatest musicians to ever roam the skies, and they get no recognition. But you can change that. All you need to do is buy this LG Hi-Fi Entertainment & Karaoke System. Then, come your next karaoke party, make it a rule: only bird bands.

Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a child. Let’s call him @Dave. Dave wore Sears-brand Toughskin jeans. They were, as their name implied, durable and long-lasting. But, like most economically practical things, corners needed to be cut to keep them affordable, and, unfortunately for Dave, the corner Toughskin jeans cut was the let’s-make-these-things-look-cool corner.
Or maybe not unfortunately. Because Dave rarely felt self-conscious in his Toughskin jeans. What did make him feel self-conscious was when, in the mid-80s, his grandparents splurged and got him a Generra sweatshirt. It was “in.” Very “in.” In fact, you could say that it was so deeply “in” that the brand couldn’t find its way out of the decade.
Suddenly, all the other kids at school were stopping Dave in the hallway to say, “Cool sweatshirt,” and, after years of remaining invisible behind the Toughskin curtain, he didn’t know how to react to such a compliment. It was uncomfortable.
Dave has come a long way since then… or has he? No, he doesn’t wear Toughskin jeans anymore, but he still has a Toughskin mindset. He’s not afraid of bright purple laptops or speakers that are loud in both function and design. This, in some ways, is his calling: espousing the virtues of things that don’t look exactly like you’d hope but work just fine.
But he doesn’t exactly know what to do with these slick-looking Rowkin Bluetooth Ear Buds.
Does he say: just because Meh sells some stuff that has substance but lacks style does NOT mean the stylish stuff we sell lacks substance in equal measure? Does he point out that many of the negative reviews on Amazon that have driven the average rating down to an unimpressive 3 stars can be put into 3 categories:

people complaining about the hefty (non-Meh) price tag;
people who struggled with a weird issue that was corrected easily by a factory reset; and
people hating on Bluetooth technology as a whole?

Does he mention that many reviews were impressed with both their size and sound quality (and again, that those people were reviewing after, presumably, paying some 50 bucks more the price they are offered at here)?
No. @Dave does none of these things. He has a copywriter do it, duh."	0.05			2018-09-20T04:00:02.850Z	0.2538143856831479	0.92	72743

As we’ve mentioned before, we recently won an auction for a storage locker that was filled entirely with branded content romance novels. Or so we thought. But, picking through the titles, we actually found many belonged to a branded content epic fantasy series by the author L.L.R. Holdien about a warrior named Tarklaw The Powerful. Luckily for us, there’s a chapter in book 19 about today’s product, the Keysmart (and Keysmart Pro).

Having successfully freed the shape-shifting wizard Vintel, son of Filor The Great, from the floating prison of Delkabana, narrowly escaping the light-spears of the Meschlen Guards by leaping through a portal leading somewhere that only a seer like Wise Crin might intuit–Tarklaw found himself deposited into murky waist-high water.
“Vintel?” Tarklaw called out, trying to locate the wizard whom he had just a moment ago saved, despite their families’ centuries-long acrimonious relations.
“I’m right here, Tarklaw,” Vintel seemed to whisper into his ear, buzzingly. “As a shape-shifting wizard, it is my custom to acclimate my shape to the environs, and so I have taken the form a mosquito because we, bitter-family-enemy-turned-savior, appear to be in a swamp.”
“Not just any swamp! The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors!” came a voice that belonged neither to Tarklaw or Vintel, but another in their vicinity. Tarklaw turned quickly, drawing his great sword with a shing sound common of sword-drawing. But he found only a small creature not unlike an unshelled tortoise, swimming towards them. “Forgive me for startling you! I am Rewn, peaceful leader of the Melorians, the primary inhabitants of this swamp at the edge of the Planet Glor at the far reaches of the Heplan Galaxy. Now, I imagine you’ve come here through some pesky portal or other, but fear not: your exit is easily made through one of the Eight Astounding Doors.”
“Doors?” Said Tarklaw. “I am from the planet Phentalon, a place without doors, due to our peoples’ openness with each other.”
“Very noble,” Rewn said. “Perhaps one day, The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors shall be like that. For now, you must choose one. They go to any number of worlds, from the euphorically beautiful mountain-scape of Relan to the hellish fire-deserts of Dumask. And we have all the keys right here…” Rewn dipped under the water for a moment, but re-emerged with a perplexed look upon his creaturely face. “Oh, dear! They were right there a moment ago.”
“You simply allow all keys to be strewn throughout a swamp?” buzzed Vintel.
“Not exactly,” Rewn said, explanatorily. “We keep them all together using an ingenious contraption known as a KeySmart. Made of aircraft aluminum, it can hold eight keys–or as many as fourteen, with an expansion pack! Additionally, it includes a loop for keys belonging to vehicles propelled by motors. Not to mention, its extended frame can hold long or foreign keys, which is especially important to us, as one of our oldest and most prized keys is made from the hollow bird-like finger bone of the fallen Hilderan Mage Lazlorn.”
“But,” Vintel buzzed, contrarily, “as ingenious and organizationally optimized as that all sounds, it seems at present not to be helping in your ability to locate them.”
“Ah, yes, that would be true if it were the base model, which is still good,” Rewn said. “Luckily for us, we opted for the Pro. Not only does it have a built-in LED flashlight and bottle opener; it can also show a map of your missing keys, and by way of the Tile app–which can be accessed via your smartphone or tablet–you can make your keys ring out loud! Of course, I should add at this juncture that the ‘water’ here in the The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors is different in elemental makeup to that of the water on other planets, such as Earth.”
“Are you saying,” Vintel buzzed, clarifyingly, “that just because we are discussing the KeySmart Pro being used in a water-based situation, it should not be taken as an endorsement of it being waterproof?”
“Exactly,” cried Rewn, disclaimingly.
“Much like doors, smartphones and tablets are concepts foreign to my home world,” Tarklaw said. “But that sounds like a great functional product nonetheless.”
“And I will show you just how functional it is!” Rewn cried with excitement. He brought forward a device and opened the Tile app. A moment later, a ding rang out, though it sounded muffled. The three of them turned… and stood facing a giant glowing snake-like beast. It emerged from the water, standing nearly forty Glorian theltans tall, or forty feet tall in Earth measurements, Glorian theltans being exactly equal to terrestrial feet. The ding sounded again, from somewhere deep inside of the monster’s abdomen.
“Oh no! A Mirelord! Run!” Rewn cried with fear. “Or, better yet, swim.” And with that, he disappeared under the water.
But Tarklaw did not swim away. He crouched into a combat ready position as best he could in the deep murky water. The Mirelord leaned closer to him, its eyes alight with evil.
“What are you doing?” buzzed Vintel into his ear, questioningly.
“We must get out of this swamp,” Tarklaw cried. “This is the only way. Though, it will be hard for just the two of us to defeat it…”
“Perhaps, I can help?” came a distinguished voice from Tarklaw’s side.
Tarklaw turned, and saw… no! He couldn’t believe it! “Hinton, son of Raquille, wielder of The Great Axe Of Orlagos, and best friend since birth of Tarklaw The Powerful? But I thought you were–”
“The immortal prisoner of the Inter-dimensional Pirate Lop, locked away in the his ship, The Pummeling Ewlok, for all of eternity?” Hinton laughed. “Not a chance in Dumask, my friend! Now, what do you say we free the aforementioned product from the belly of the beast? Just like old times?”
Tarklaw couldn’t help but smile. “Just like old times, indeed,” he said, and they raised their weapons to the approaching Mirelord."	0.05			2018-09-19T04:00:10.856Z	0.34612555704581827	0.93	72268

One time, I left without remembering to close the door.
I was living in a house somewhere so rural we didn’t need to lock up, and, in a rush to leave (I was going on a trip), I forgot to swing the door all the way closed, leaving only the screen door between my cat and freedom. He was fine. My mom checked on him the next day and, much to her surprise, he emerged from under the deck after spending what must’ve been, for an indoor cat, a terrifying night outside.
Just about every time I have left the house since then, even if just for an hour, I have wondered: “did I close the door? Did I lock the door? Do the pets have food? Do they have water? Did I leave the oven on? Did I unconsciously light seven candles and place them precariously close to window curtains that are, unbeknownst to me, highly flammable?” Many times, I have gone back to check. Never have I left the stove on. Never have I found candles flickering. The pets have always been fine. Only once or twice have I found the door unlocked.
Still, I never regret it, because it’s nicer to know everything’s fine than it is to hope everything’s fine.
And that’s really what these Zmodo MeShare cameras are for: making sure. You can call them “security cameras,” but that feels a little overstated. Maybe it would be better to rebrand them as “check-in cameras.” After all, the chances that you’re going to tune in as your home is being burglarized–thus allowing you to call the authorities while the burglary is in progress–is very low. I mean, hell, the actual likeliness of your home being burglarized at all is very low. And if your first thought upon reading that is, Nuh-uh, my home gets broken into all the time, we won’t argue with you. But we will say: you probably need more than a couple Zmodos.
Otherwise, these are a good option for the second-guessers out there to quell all the concerns that might flare up during your day at work: whether you just want to make sure everything’s fine, or to check that you didn’t forget to close the windows, or to monitor whether your dog is feeling okay after eating something stupid that he wasn’t supposed to…

Every time they sit down they’ll think, “Hey, you know what: I’m special!” And this confidence will push them to do great things.
Game Room

Checkers is simple and boring on a board… but what about in a room, with you and all of your friends as the pieces? To make it more exciting: institute a rule where it’s not as easy as just “jumping” another piece; instead, you have to battle for it. Whoever doesn’t get cast into one of the empty spaces (i.e. onto the floor) wins!

Think about it: you cover the floor of your kitchen, wall-to-wall, with Sactionals, and now, suddenly, you can drop a glass or a ceramic mug and it won’t shatter! Plus, they’re machine washable, in case there’s a spill. Best of all, if you need to keep an eye on something you’ve got baking, you can just lay down next to the oven and watch it!

Dear @reclaimercube,
On September 2nd, you posted the following comment on a knife sale:

Meh I have anxiously been awaiting for you to post a toothbrush for sale again. I will post this everyday until you finally sell another one again.

And, @reclaimercube, can we tell you something? We’re very proud of you. Because you kept your word. Since then, each day, you’ve put forward this same request.
Your fellow Meh customers began to notice. One post from Friday, September 7th sparked a discussion that involved more than 20 comments. In that conversation, someone pointed out a toothbrush for sale on a competitor’s site. You, ever strong, refused to take the bait:

not a bad deal… But not on meh so it doesn’t matter. You could link me to colgate’s website or crest’s website for a free toothbrush and I still wouldn’t want it unless it was on meh. I’m chaining myself to this statue. Ride or die mehbrother.

Your repeated request did not specify why you wanted a toothbrush, or what kind of toothbrush you wanted. Really, you haven’t even promised that you’d buy the toothbrush. You’ve only asked, repeatedly, for us to “post a toothbrush.”
Well, good news, @reclaimercube: when we launched Meh, we made a decision. Once, and only once, we would allow a Meh customer to dictate exactly what we’d sell. The only rule was they had to make the request for 13 consecutive days. They could ask for $1 MacBooks, or free puppies, or Cadillac Escalades filled with cash. It didn’t matter. There were no restrictions, aside from the 13 days. Some of us worried the financial hit would be too much, but others felt assured: we could trust our customers! They wouldn’t make unreasonable demands!
So thank you, @reclaimercube; you’ve shown us that our faith was not misplaced. Now, Meh community, let’s all come together and celebrate with this build-your-own-bundle of toothbrushes.

Hair: it is the ultimate example of disobedience.
You can train puppies to pee outside, to walk next to you, to sit, to shake, to do any number of fun and/or useful things. With cats, the job is much harder, but with some persistence (and a spray bottle) it is possible to enforce a few rules: you do not yowl in the middle of the night, you do not walk on the kitchen counter, you do not knock our decorative trinkets off the mantle as a game. Even a bonsai can be coaxed, over time, to grow a certain way.
But not hair. Nope, no matter how many times you comb, shave, style, epilate, and wax: it can just never take the fucking hint!
You know that person in your  your life who’s like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “hmm, maybe?” And you hope they’ll just drop it, but then a day later, they’re like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “I don’t know if that dumb thing is really a good idea.” Which should be clear as hell, but they don’t want to listen, so they keep prodding and prodding until you’re like, “Look,  I don’t want to do the dumb thing because it is dumb, and honestly, I’m worried you might be dumb for suggesting it, and I might be dumb for being the friend of such a dumb person.” And you feel terrible but they just smile and say, “C’mon! It’ll be great!”
That’s hair. No matter how many times you try to send the message that you don’t want it to come back there, it keeps coming back there. It is untrainable!
Or is that the wrong way to look at it? Could it be that we are the untrainable ones? That our hair is not being a stubborn learner but a tenacious teacher? That it wants to lead us to a better place? A place where we eschew the standards of beauty thrust upon us? Because isn’t it pretty arbitrary where we say there should be hair and where we say there should not? On the head is good, but not on the face? Except some faces capable of growing thick enough hair? On the chest is okay, but no, never on the back? Not on the legs, but okay on the arms, except in the armpits? Could it be that our hair’s persistence is its way of saying: you need to get the hell over it and just be who you are?

The three brothers had been cleaning out their grandfather’s basement for nearly two hours before they found the FoodSaver.
“What’s this?” said Kyle, holding it up.
“Looks old,” said Jake. “I’d guess circa second half of the 2010’s.”
Terry took it from Kyle and inspected it. “Wait, I know these things. It’s an early model weed-sealer. You know? The devices for vacuum-packing weed so it wouldn’t go bad.”
“All this talk of weed remind me, have you guys taken your three o’clock edibles yet?” Jake asked.
Kyle and Terry nodded.
“But wait,” Kyle said, “why does it say FoodSaver on it, if it’s for weed?”
“You have to understand, Kyle, this was before weed was legal everywhere,” Terry explained. “They didn’t even put it in the water back then!”
Kyle looked at the FoodSaver perplexed. “Really?”
“I’m serious,” Terry said. “So people weren’t as acclimated to it as we are now. They considered it a drug. Thus, when people took some, they got ‘high,’ which basically meant they thought without logic. So it’s likely that the inventor of the ‘FoodSaver’ only named it such because he was super high, and probably pretty hungry.”
“So strange to think that the same substance that keeps us calm and measured, used to have almost the opposite effect!” Kyle said.
Now Jake had the FoodSaver. “Are you sure this is a weed-sealer? To me, it looks like an early sous-vide-assistant. That would make more sense with the FoodSaver name.”
“Did they even sous vide back then?” Terry asked.
“Sure,” Jake said. “It was more of a luxury, though, given that it was before the Microwave And Oven Act of 2035.”
“When I read about those times, and all the negative-energy-pollution caused by those now illegal kitchen appliances, it just makes me sick,” Terry said.
“Guys, you’ve got me thinking…” Kyle paused to gather his thoughts. “Well, you know how when we put stuff in the freezer, it just freezes together and gets covered in weird ice?”
“They’re called water diamonds, Kyle,” Terry said.
“They mean the moisture has accepted the food, so we know it’s safe to eat,” Jake said.
“I’m well aware of them and what they mean. Don’t forget, I’m the one who studied health at Dove For Men Presents: College. But I was thinking, the food doesn’t always taste good after the water diamonds form.” Kyle took the FoodSaver from Jake. “And I know this is going to sound crazy, but if this thing could keep weed fresh, and be used with food products for sous-vide purposes, maybe we could combine the two functions. Like, we could use it to seal food before we freeze it so it stays fresher longer.”
“You mean, you want to eat food that’s been frozen but hasn’t emitted its proper water diamonds?” Terry said.
“Isn’t that illegal?” Jake added.
“Sure, on Earth. But not here,” Kyle said, “on Mars.”
Jake and Terry had to admit he had a point: they definitely had been on Mars this whole time."	0.05			2018-09-13T04:00:05.184Z	0.21097046413502127	0.92	62121

As someone who doesn’t brush his hair much, Wet Brushes look, to me, like normal brushes. But looks can be deceiving. Or, in this case, the looks are deceivingly simple. In truth, everything I’ve read about them states, quite simply, that they’re best brushes around. And today, we’re selling a pack of three: one pro, one pop fold, and one paddle.
They’re all designed specifically to brush out tangles without pain or tugging. They work especially well on wet hair, but can be used on dry hair too, even wigs and extensions. The paddle features “AquaVents” that help with ventilation and drying as you brush. In short, they sound great. But again, I don’t brush my hair really ever, so if you don’t want to take my word for it–or the word of the many happy customers over on Amazon–then maybe these totally real reviews from absolutely not-made-up hair professionals will help seal the deal:

“Great brushes,” says Hairrison Ford.
“I love mine,” says Braid Pitt.
“The best,” says Julia Stylist.
“Top shelf stuff,” says David Mulletterman.
“My favorite,” says Follicle․i․am.
“Excellent products,” says Scarlet Johansbun.
“The only name I trust,” says David Sprayed.
“Fantastic value,” says Gel-ly Clarkson.
“Just awesome,” says K.D. Bang(s).
“Use mine every day,” says Partin’ Lawrence.
“Why get the rest when you can have the best?” says Pompadoris Burke.
“Bloody good stuff,” says Hairy Styles.
“A triumph in brush-making,” says Kate Brush.
“One thumb up, because I’m using my other thumb to hold a Wet Brush,” says Ethan MoHawke.
“Hands down, the greatest,” says Mariah Hair-Carey.
“Hot take: they’re amazing,” says James Comby, former director of the FBI (Federal Bureau of Interesting-Hair-Styles).

The Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet is pretty simple: it’s a wallet that comes with a powerpack, which can be used to charge your phone or other devices.
In a way, to recharge something is to refill it, but unfortunately, while the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet does fill your wallet in the literal sense–like, there is a powerpack inside of it–it can’t refill your wallet in the figurative sense–as in, recharge your bank account.
Or can it?
Because think about this: what kind of phone is the most likely to have a short battery life? An old phone! And maybe you have an upgrade waiting for you, but you don’t want to dish out the money for one. Because maybe, with your provider, it’s not as simple as handing over $200 and getting a new iPhone. Now, you pay for the upgrade via a small increase in your monthly bill–a small increase that over time accumulates into a lot of money. And it’s very possible that this change was made because people like you: people who buy a phone and then ride it into the ground, thus spending a couple hundred bucks every six years, rather than evert two like your cell company–let’s call them Werizon–would prefer.
And so now you’ve got a geriatric phone that needs a pick-me-up every few hours to make it through the day, and you’re not always near an outlet, so one of these Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallets–‘wallets’ plural because you get a 2-pack–is just what you need. It’s your wallet, so it’s not like you’ll forget it. Thus, you’ll always have some charge on hand, which means you don’t need to upgrade, which means your phone bill won’t go up, which means you’ll save money, which, in conclusion, means the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet can, in fact, recharge both your phone and your wallet!

I remember being a kid, riding in my parents’ car at night, and dropping something. Maybe a toy or a quarter. It doesn’t matter what. What matters is I reached up and turned on the dome light to find the object in question. And it was then that my dad freaked the fuck out. You would’ve thought I’d tossed hot acid in his eyes. “Turn that off! I can’t see anything!” he claimed. He might’ve even swerved a little, for emphasis. As a dutiful child, I switched the light off as quickly as possible to avoid careening off the road into a ditch.
Flash forward some years: I have a license. I have a car. A friend is riding with me. He turns on the dome light for something and… everything is fine.
The same thing happened the first time I helped jumpstart a car. I’d been told so many times about everything that can go terribly wrong that I felt sure that it would end in a) an deadly storm of electricity and fire; or b) one or both of the cars being fried for good. Turns out, if you, ya know, just follow instructions, it works out fine.
If anything, the greatest risk of jumping a car–the one that no amount of how-to articles or Youtube videos can save you from–is the risk of wasting a favor. Because think about it: you spend all that time being a good friend and building up positive equity until you’ve almost got enough to cash in for pet care or help shlepping some furniture from your old apartment to your new one… Then your car battery farts out and now your buddy is driving over in the cold to help you get it started again.
That’s where this iJoy Jump Starter Kit comes in. Not only will it charge your phone and provide some you with some light; it’ll make it so that you don’t need to dip into the favor bank just to get your car running.

Roy laughed. Not at the man but at the theory the honk had charitably eradicated from his mind. Lorraine couldn’t be the Scarlet Savior. Sure, they both had striking red hair, but the Scarlet Savior always wore a matching Treasure Island jewelry set–one necklace, one bracelet, both made out of genuine gemstones and pearls–whereas Lorraine wore a single longer Treasure Island necklace, which was also made of genuine gemstones and pearls.
Well, that settles that! Roy thought. And just in time too! Because here she came, the Scarlet Savior, flying through the sky, blazing a red path through the sky that, strangely, looked like it originated on the roof of the Gazette’s offices.

For those keeping score at home: that’s now a $9 difference between the two.
In some ways, this isn’t simply a sale; it’s an experiment. We want to answer the question: what is a zipper truly worth?

There are three potential outcomes to buying this Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk:
Outcome 1
You buy the standing desk. You’re intrigued by its promises of a stronger core, healthier circulation, improved productivity, and better posture. But the truth is, you don’t care for it. You’ve spent your entire life believing that getting work done requires sitting down and shutting up. So how do you expect, as an adult, to change your working position? Maybe if you gave it more time… but you don’t want to. You just want to use it as a normal desk. And that’s fine! Because this thing didn’t cost north of $600 like some models out there; it cost less than $200. And look, that’s not nothing, but it was a worthwhile gamble.
Outcome 2
You love your new standing desk. But it’s not enough. Once you taste the thrill of working upright, you want more. You quickly replace your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk with a treadmill desk. You start out walking, but soon enough you’re outright sprinting while you manage your spreadsheets and respond to emails. You get a kiddy pool and set it up behind the treadmill, filling it with a medley of pirañas and water moccasins. Now, any slowdown and you’re in trouble. But even that’s not enough. You take out the water moccasins, extract their venom, and put it in an IV that runs directly into your arm. The anti-venom is in another IV that you’ve rigged to only administer as you meet your hourly sales goals. Your friends and family members are worried about you, but you’ve never felt more alive! And it all started with the Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk!
Outcome 3
You get your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk, and you like it. You crank it up to standing height for a few hours of the day; for the rest of the time, you use it as a normal desk. You’re neither disappointed, nor unsatisfied. It meets your needs, and you will use it for the foreseeable future.

Shaving is the blandest and yet most grueling task of every personal grooming regimen. It is a zero sum game: you can put it off, but that only means it’ll be a longer and more grueling process when eventually you do get around to it. It’s like mowing the lawn, except without the exercise, and the smell of fresh cut grass replaced by the noxious chemical odor of shave gel. In short, it’s miserable.
Or it was. Until now. Enter these “Famous Maker” razors. Famous Maker? you say. But who IS the famous maker? That’s just the thing, we can’t tell you. And now suddenly, shaving is an act of immeasurable mystery and excitement!
Could it be that these razors are the excess produced by an underground razor factory located far below Park City? Perhaps for the original purpose of being distributed, in secret, to the agents and publicists and personal assistants of actors in town for the Sundance Film Festival? So that these various agents and publicists and assistants could sneak into the actors’ hotel rooms at night and shave their faces clean while they slept? Because maybe the actors, having escaped the always-on environs of Los Angeles, wanted to let themselves go, but the various men and women whose livelihoods relied on their pristine image had other things in mind?
Or could it be that the razors are from a different hidden factory, a facility built into the side of one of the Alps? For a baron? A baron who volunteered to host the worldwide beard and mustache contest at his expansive villa? While harboring a secret hatred of all facial hair? And so the plan was not to celebrate these growers of elaborate beards and mustaches, but to trap them and then use the razors to, as the baron said in a private correspondence, “reveal their cheeks upper lips once again to the world”? Maybe he even wanted to shave the hair on their head too, just to prove a point? Only his scheme was discovered by the lowly helper-boy tasked with taking his correspondence to the post office? And so the baron had no choice but to sell off his stock of razors in an effort to cut (pun intended) his losses?
Or could it be a pretty basic story of a razor company having some leftover razors that they wanted to offload? Only they couldn’t do so under their own name? Because then people would be like, “but wait, I just spent this much on these at the store, but now you’re selling them for cheap online? That’s bullshit!”?
Okay, for purposes of whimsy, let’s just ignore that last scenario. Instead, focus on the first two, buy these razors, and shave with an entirely new sense of intrigue!"	0.05			2018-09-05T04:00:15.298Z	0.26119278036366067	0.93	62903

The actors threw up their hands. The camera man shook his head. The boom operator brought the boom mic booming to the ground in disgust.
“What,” the director said, “is that infernal noise?”
“Sorry,” said the PA. “It’s my light. It ran out of battery so I had to crank it.”
“Didn’t I tell you to crank this morning, to make sure it had enough charge to light the scene?”
“Yeah, you did,” said the PA, “But, sir, I gotta be honest, I don’t think this is the right light for a film set. I mean, I could see the utility of having one at your house.

Can I level with you here: I’m just not much a knife guy. I have a set of good kitchen knives and that’s about it. I open boxes with my keys cut through frustrating packaging with a pair of scissors. I don’t mean any judgment. I’m just being honest. The problem is, I have to write about this knife, and I can’t just say, “Uh, I don’t know? It’s fine, probably?”
Or so I thought…
Then I went to do some research on Amazon and saw a question about what material was used to make the pivot washers and how thick the blade is. The first answer reads as follows:

Sorry, this was a gift for someone in Arizona so I can’t answer your question. I can only say that the knife is substantial!

Wait, seriously? This is allowed? Admitting that you don’t know the answer… counts as an answer?! Well then friends, I’ve got some great news: I can answer all the questions you have about this 2-Pack of C.R.K.T. Ruger Go-N-Heavy Compact VEFF Serrated Knives! Let’s do it!
So, how thick is the blade?
Great question! I’d guess that it’s probably about the same as other knives like it, although it could be thicker. But even then, it wouldn’t be too much thicker, because that would be weird, right?
I’m reading that it has a “stonewashed drop-point blade.” That sounds intense. What kind of stuff can you use it for?
I bet it would be pretty good at cutting through most stuff you’d use a knife like this for, but I don’t feel comfortable naming specific stuff because I’ve never used one. I will say this, though: there’s a good chance it can cut through butter. And an even better chance if the butter has been left out of the fridge for a little while.
Was it designed by Bill Harsey?
Sure was! As to who Bill Haresay is, lol, idk! I would venture to guess he does something in the knife industry.
One reviewer says that it is 11.8"" long when it’s extended. Is that longer than other knives?
Not sure. It is definitely not as long as a foot, because a foot is 12"". With that being said, another reviewer posted a photo of it next to another knife and a tape measurer, if that helps. It is bigger than the other knife, but not the tape measurer (which is good, because those things can get really long).
Wow! This is so easy! It’s great to finally realize how much a knife expert I really am! Thanks Amazon question answerer, for showing me the way.

This Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble may seem simple enough. It’s 6 100% ceramic products with matching designs: a toothbrush holder, a tumbler, a soap dish, a lotion dispenser, a tissue box, and a trash bin. None of these things require much explanation. What does deserve some attention, though, is the multi-stage process that one goes through when deciding to buy one or all of them. We’ve laid it out below:
Stage 1: Intrigue
These are interesting. The various pieces look stylish, and they all match. It might be nice to have a motif that really brings the entire bathroom together.
Stage 2: Skepticism
But do I really need any of these? The old coffee mug we put the toothbrushes in works just fine, as does the little wicker basket we’ve got for trash. The sink already has a built-in soap dish. This one would be easier to clean, but do you really need to clean something when all it does is hold soap? Isn’t soap itself essentially the concept of cleanliness made solid? Lotion bottles already come with a pump top and tissue boxes are their own tissue dispensers, really. Am I supposed to re-package things? Isn’t that adding unnecessary steps?
Stage 3: Re-evaluation
Yes, I guess technically it is adding unnecessary steps, but all in the service of style. And maybe that’s worth it. Which would maybe mean the steps aren’t unnecessary?
*Stage 4: Introspection
And what does it say about me that I’m so put off by these objectively simple tasks? Like, it isn’t hard to empty some lotion from one thing into another thing. It isn’t hard to put a box of tissues inside another box. Or clean a soap dish. Just like it isn’t hard to put a new bag in the garbage after I take the trash out. But I never do, not right away at least. I always wait hours, sometimes even a whole day, leaving paper towels and granola bar wrappers on the kitchen counter, until finally my desire for a clean surface outweighs my laziness. At which point I put a new bag in the garbage can and am reminded that the laziness was all to avoid something that takes mere seconds. And yet, when next I need to take out the trash, this process will repeat. Making matters worse: someday it might not just be taking out the trash. Someday it might be dirty diapers I’m dealing with. It might be taking kids to the doctor. It might taking the medication I need to stay alive. And when that time comes will I just attempt to put it off? I want to say no, that I’ll be past all of this by then, that I’ll finally be a responsible organized adult… but an I’m adult now, damnit! I should already be better than this!
Stage 5: Ascension
That’s it! No more! I’m going to buy every item in this Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble, not just because it’s stylish and will tie my bathroom together nicely! No, that’s all secondary. Really, I’m doing it to prove to everyone–but especially myself–that I’m capable of taking the right steps and building good habits! New me, here we come!
Stage 6: Regression
Purchase made! Now, it’s time for bed. Shit, wait? It’s trash day tomorrow, isn’t it? I should take the bin to the curb. Although, there really are only a couple bags in there. I’m sure I’d be fine until next week…"	0.07			2018-09-01T04:00:01.758Z	0.3734081588603498	0.94	49783

There’s an old saying about innovation: “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.” It is derived from an Emerson quote that reads: “If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.” In this way, the saying is an example of itself; the ‘mousetrap’ variant is shorter, snappier, and conveys the exact same meaning, thus it is the one most often used.
The implication here is basically if you build it, they will come: you’ll have lines around the block, people from all over frantically waving their bills in the air demanding the latest in mouse-entrapment technology.
The truth, we know now, is a bit different.
The world, upon beating a path to your door, would say, “This mousetrap is smaller and more humane than the previous mousetrap, but now I’ve decided I want a mousetrap that is smaller and more humane.” Or, “I have no mice in my house, but many spiders, and this mousetrap did not catch a single spider, which is a bit of a disappointment.” Or, “Excuse me, I have some ideas for how you might make this better mousetrap–which is a good start–into an even greater mousetrap, despite the fact that I have never myself built any mousetrap.”
And so it goes with the Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Pack. You can put it in the microwave if you need heat, or you can put in the freezer if you want it to be cold. The ceramic beads heat and cool with the gel, providing a nice texture, which one Amazon reviewer says, “makes for an easy massage.” But the title of that review–“slightly different than the norm”–is telling. It implies that the incorporation of a heretofore never used component is something slight. Innovation, people seem to believe, requires a total redo.
Yes, some reviews expressed issues with durability. That’s understandable to call out. A few wished it would be more pliable when frozen. Again, fair.
But then there are the other “complaints.”
One says: “The only drawback I’ve seen so far to this item is its size. For the most part, I don’t think the size will be an issue because it’s probably rare to treat an area larger than 6x10”.""
Just so we’re clear: the only issue this reviewer could foresee would arise in a scenario that they couldn’t foresee arising.
Another–in a review titled “Does the job but not much better than competition”–claims: “the problem is just like every other reusable gel back I’ve ever used: they simply don’t remain truly hot or cold enough for long enough to do a good job. They’re more warm or cool than they are hot or cold for much longer.”
To put it differently: the biggest problem with this product, in this reviewer’s experience, is endemic to this entire product category, not just this product, and relies upon a universal tolerance of hot and cold temperatures.
The point of all this is to show that people will always find things to gripe about. And maybe they’re right. Still, it seems like the best case scenario is that you really love the texture of the ceramic beads inside the gel, and the worst case scenario is that you get three of totally passable hot/cold packs for $18.

Here we go again! The return of The Skeptics Choice, our occasional write-up segment wherein we read what a product claims to do and say, “hmm… I don’t know…” Today, we’re talking about a PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser. Follow along, won’t you?
The Claim
For all those who are thinking that we’ve been through this all before, fear not: this is a different kind of diffuser than the one we sold last time. This one is a “one-of-a-kind product combines the therapeutic properties of a pure Himalayan salt rock lamp with the soothing aromatherapy of an essential oil diffuser.” Apparently, it sets “the perfect mood for relaxation at home” and provides “all the benefits you would expect from this powerful combo.”
The Skepticism
That last part is a little presumptuous. All the benefits I would expect? I understand each word in the phrase “Himalayan Salt Lamp” on its own, but I know nothing about what they mean when they’re put together. But that’s no bother! It’s all laid out right there in the marketing copy:


The first benefit is that it will “help boost your mood.” And honestly, that sounds legit! When you’ve had your windows shut for almost 12 consecutive months because it took just a single day for the seasons transition from the bitter cold of winter to the brutal humidity of summer, something that makes the air smell pretty can be a nice little pick-me-up.


The second benefit is that it can “increase energy levels.” This seems a little more like bullshit than the first claim, but it’s vague enough that I’m willing to give it a pass.


The third benefit is that it will “neutralize the positively charged ions that emit from electronic devices like smartphones, televisions, radios, and more.”


Umm, what the fuck? That sure escalated quickly.
Seriously, the difference in hysteria levels from “it might boost your mood” to “it’ll protect you from killer ions” is about equal to the difference between a “hang in there, kitty” poster and one of those spam posts from MySpace that was like, “Post this on 10 of your friends’ profiles or else your eyes will fall out.”
And by the way, I’m not against a lot of this stuff. Crystals are fine. Astrology is fine. You could argue that it’s unscientific, but that’s missing the point. Life sucks sometimes. If getting some stones to put in your pocket makes you feel less like you’re flying a cloud of chaos towards an inevitably disappointing conclusion, more power to you! I watch groups of men in polyester play what is basically an IRL-board game involving sticks and balls on an enormous grass-and-dirt field, and if the group of men I like outplays the group of men I don’t like, I feel profound happiness. So, I try not to judge people for the things they use to pass the time.
But I will ABSOLUTELY judge anyone who preys upon someone based on those things. Because that’s what they’re doing here. They’re not saying: “you like this thing? we make this thing~” They’re saying, “we make this thing! it is DANGEROUS not to have this thing!!!” In other words, it’s taking something that should be a distraction from the chaos of daily life–which it totally could be, by the way: it’s cool looking; it lights up; it smells nice–and turning it into part of the chaos of daily life. And that’s messed up.
(Also, sorta tangential but still relevant, it’s problematic in a whole other way: What’s dangerous about technology is not that it’s pumping the air full of ions; it’s how intrusive it is. For example, did you know that if you say “Bloody Mary” three times into your smart phone, an ad for “great local brunch spots” will appear on your Facebook timeline? Our devices are definitely listening to us. We can all agree on that, right? Fine, maybe I’m just being paranoid. But you have to know that every Google search, every purchase, every photo you post is being mined for important data. And so making it a conversation about “ions” is pushing it in a direction that helps no one but those selling PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffusers.)
The Conclusion
If you want a thing that lights up and looks cool and smells nice, this is a good investment. If you’re thinking about buying this because you’re afraid to breath in all the electro-turds you released into the air while binging Sharp Objects, maybe open a window?"	0.05			2018-08-30T04:00:02.770Z	0.20794343938448737	0.93	60935

I’m a lawyer, but right now, I’m not in the courtroom. Instead, it’s late at night and I’m in my office, wearing Ray-Ban glasses, poring over all the evidence of this grueling case, trying to find something to prove my client is innocent. All the older lawyers at this firm didn’t want to take my client on, and I’m starting to see why, but then again, I’m a young perky go-getter. Sometimes I worry that I’m too concerned with upholding justice, that I get too wrapped up in what’s right and wrong, that I fall in love with too many of my clients. But I can’t think about that now. I need to squint through my Ray-Bans at this piece of paper, then dig out another piece of paper and squint at that one, before realizing I’ve found it: a small but pretty obvious detail that proves my client wasn’t there that night. Thanks, Ray-Bans! I couldn’t have done it without you.

I’m a bit of a nerd. You can tell because I’m always wearing these thick Ray-Ban frames. Also, I’m always doing nerdy things like taking notes in class or carrying a lot of books. Sometimes I drop them, to the delight of cheerleaders and jocks. My best friend is quirky and outgoing, but I am not. I have a figure that would require a nutritionist and hours of gym time each day to maintain, but you can’t see it under these bulky sweaters that I wear, while sitting in my bedroom listening to non-aggressive indie rock or reading an obscure book like Wuthering Heights or The Collected Plays of William Shakespeare. Perhaps someday, someone will move here from out of town and crack this high school’s social hierarchy wide open, but until then it’s just me, my one quirky friend, my books, my sweaters, and my Ray-Ban glasses.

3.

I’m what you might call a savant. I’m always doing things like solving unsolvable math equations, or going to the park and playing five games of chess at a time… and winning. The crisp lines of my Ray-Ban frames are definitely in stark contrast with my wildly disheveled hair! Can I tell you something? I wasn’t surprised to see the government suits show up at my house. What did surprise me was when they took me to the research facility and showed me what they found. I stared at it for a whole a minute. Then I dramatically took off my Ray-Ban glasses, wiped them on my shirt, and stared at it for a minute longer. I didn’t know what I was looking at. What I did know was that, despite being just a guy from Queens (with the IQ of a Nobel laureate), I might save the world. Strap in, Ray-Bans! This is going to be a long ride!

Dearest Meh Customers,
Apparently, our minds cannot be trusted, and for that we are sorry.
You see, in our previous attempt to sell these M Cushions, we misinterpreted a few things. By which we mean, we mistook several vague comments about the massager being applied to unnamed areas beyond the back to mean…
Hmmm…
How do we say it exactly?
Let’s try this: we thought you were implying that the M Cushion could be applied to places where the combination of friction and heat might bring about sensations not unrelated to relief, but a step beyond relief, a sort of deep relief that goes by many names, one of which it shares with a term from film and literature meaning the culmination of the story’s drama.
But, um… apparently we were a little off-base. As one quoted commenter noted:

I swear I didn’t mean it in a sexual way. I just meant after leg day you can lean back in bed and use it on your aching thighs rather comfortably.

So, we apologize to you, commenters who we misunderstood. And moreover, we apologize also to all out there who purchased the M Cushion hoping for that aforementioned special sense of relief and, instead, received what seems to be a pretty good, if not aggressive, massage pillow and little else.
Thus, we promise not to make the same mistake again. We will heretofore not only market the M Cushion 18"" Heated Shiatsu Massage Pillow in a straightforward manner; we also vow never to purposefully misinterpret anything said on our forums as sexual innuendo… unless it’s, like, really funny to do so.

Time to dive into our library of branded content romance novels, for a tale of secrecy, royalty, and grilling. Please enjoy these excerpts from Coals Aflame by Criminy Highlater.

Grilling with one tool? Mary had gotten used to that thanks to her Starfrit Tonglite. In many ways, she was a lot like the 6-in-1 bbq multi-tool: she was strong, she had many skills, could do many things, and, since Eric had run off with his secretary a year before, she relied only on herself.
Which was what she planned to do that Saturday afternoon. Her work at the non-profit, helping troubled youth gain acceptance to Ivy League schools, didn’t leave her much time for making friends, so she would do it on her own. She would take a cooler, her little grill, and her Starfrit, and she would go from her apartment in Soho to Central Park to have a little cookout for one. It would be simple… or so she thought.
“M’lady, if I may have a word,” came a voice soon after she’d set up. Mary ignored it, thinking it sounded so British and refined that it must be coming from someone’s radio. But when it persisted, she looked up.
An austere and very handsome man stood in front of her.
“There you are,” he said. “I couldn’t help but gain sight of your grill, and I wondered if I might bequeath you of a favor?”
Mary had gotten good at doing things alone since Eric left, but there was something interesting about this man, something that made her desire his company.

The man said his name was Collin, and he worked for the a mysterious member of the royal family, Prince Nigel. Mary remembered seeing on the news that Nigel was making his first visit to the United States. She hadn’t listened to the story, because she’d been distracted by the strange mask the prince seemed to wear everywhere.
“What kind of work do you do for him?” Mary asked.
“All sorts,” was all Collin said.
“And so what can I help you with?” Mary asked.
“Well, being among the prince’s central envoy, I am privy to many of the finest restaurants in the world, but I don’t always want to partake in such luxury. And I was hoping you might allow me to dine with you, to take in a true American meal!”
“That’s it?” Mary asked. “You want a burger and some hot dogs?”
“'Tis my heart’s desire,” Collin said with a winning smile. “And if it would please you, I’d be happy to help. For example, perhaps I will unpack the remainder of the tools you require for grilling?”
Mary smiled and held up the Starfrit. “I only need one!”

Mary flipped burgers with the spatula when the upper arm was drawn back and rotated hot dogs with the tongs when the upper arm was extended. She opened them each a bottle of beer with the opener. “A fine colonial ale!” Collin said. Mary laughed, using the Starfrit’s serrated edge to cut the buns.
While they ate, Mary asked, “So is Prince Nigel really as eccentric as he seems?”
“You’re asking about the mask, I presume?”
Mary blushed. ""Well, I–
Collin laughed. “It’s no issue. It’s what everyone wants to know: why is he always wearing that strange masquerade mask, the one behind which he has hidden since his youth? Is his face disfigured? Is he some sort of lunatic? But the truth is, he simply desires privacy. He doesn’t want to be followed everywhere he goes.”
Mary opened her mouth, ready to say that this made sense–that she could not imagine what it must be like–when suddenly the sky went dark.
Nearby people screamed. Collin grabbed her hand, fearfully. “My god, it’s some sort of unpredicted total solar eclipse! Not even my royal astronomer saw this coming!”
Mary switched on the Starfrit’s flashlight, which she usually only used for convenient nighttime cooking.
“What do you mean ‘your’ royal astronomer?” She asked. She pointed the flashlight towards him, then towards his arm, and down to wear his hand still held hers. She felt a rush of something she had not felt in some time, not since Eric.
But then, the sun came back. Mary turned the light off and set the Starfrit down. Collin quickly stood. “I’ve just realized something, something very important,” he said. “Blast, I have so much bloody work. I must be retreating, but perhaps we could meet later? For another ale?”
Mary nodded. Collin named a bar–a dingy sports bar on the East Side–and a time. With that, he was gone. When Mary went to pack up, she couldn’t find her Starfrit anywhere. Which was a shame, as its scraper feature certainly would’ve helped her to clean her grill.

Mary waited at the bar, nursing her beer. The televisions were all turned to the baseball game, with the sound way up. Occasionally, a promo for the evening news promised coverage of Prince Nigel’s visit as well as the strange lunar happening of the afternoon.
“Who cares,” Mary mumbled to herself. Collin was late. Of course he was! He probably wasn’t coming. Another near-miss with love, she thought.
Just then, the feed cut out from the baseball game. “We interrupt this broadcast to bring you, a statement from Prince Nigel the Third.”
There he stood, the man in the strange mask. Mary laughed. He looked so silly. Then he spoke.
“Good morrow, our friends from across the pond,” he said.
Mary felt herself go rigid. She recognized that voice! But no, it couldn’t be. Could it?
“Collin?” she said, as if he could answer her through the television.
“It has been lovely visiting your many museums and areas of historical importance,” the prince went on. “But it was none of them that taught me the most. It was a single person–a single woman–who showed me the true American character, one that is not afraid of multiplicity.” He held up the Starfrit; Mary’s breath caught. “I’ve learned that, like this tool, Americans can do great things, many different great things, and are not as easily categorizable as they seem. And like this tool, they can do wonders at a grill.”
The crowd broke out in laughter in applause. Cameras flashed.
“Now, I may have more to say on this later. But right now, I must be going. I need to return this to its rightful owner. I fear I may even be late!” Just as quickly as the address had begun, it was over. The baseball game returned.
“Anyone sitting here?” a woman said to Mary, indicating the seat next to her at a bar.
Mary smiled. “Yes,” she said. “Or I should say, he’s on his way here now.”"	0.07			2018-08-25T04:00:01.567Z	0.3806925754768836	0.9	53347	0.020357891736731745

When you see an 8-piece cookware set like this–which is really a 4-piece cookware set with a lid for each item–there’s likely an image that comes to mind.
You see yourself standing at the stove, each of the four burners occupied by one of the pots or pans. Perhaps a sauce simmers in one and water comes to a boil in another for pasta that you rolled yourself. You’re sautéing some garlic and onions in yet another, and not with a spatula; instead, with just a flick of your wrist you are cycling it through the air like they do in cooking shows. In the final pan, you brown your steaks before moving them to the oven, where they will cook to a perfect medium rare.
But this image is a fantasy. You can’t actually manage cooking four precise things at once. Honestly, if your stove had only one or two burners, it would work just fine. It might free up some counter space for dealing with the onions you forgot to mince until after your butter had already melted (and burned) in the frying pan.
Thus, purchasing four pots and pans all at once is not necessary, but it is aspirational. You need to keep the dream alive, of wowing your friends and family members with perfectly balanced 4-part meals that make use of descriptors like “deconstructed” or “molecular” or “done three ways.” To have only one pan or one pot would be to admit defeat, to shut the door on your glorious dreams.
In the meantime, great news: you can make your signature “pasta a la butter and a handful of shredded cheese” in one of these just fine!

Dearest Anthony,
It is with a heavy heart that I compose this letter. When you return from your stint with the touring company, you will find me gone, and while we will always be brothers, I will no longer be welcome in our family’s house.
As you might suspect, father discovered my designs. He left for the park to perform his troupe. It was a production of Twelfth Knight, and while he had mentioned that it had been adapted for sock puppets, he made no indication that such modifications involved a shortening of runtime. Thus, I thought I would have nearly three hours of uninterrupted work time. When he arrived home just forty-five minutes later, he found me hard at work on my makeshift drawing table.
Now, I know what you are thinking: why did I not simply lie? You instructed me to do just that when I first confided in you about the designs. But Anthony, I have been lying all my life. I attended L’Academie Royale De L’Art Textile to study sock puppeteering at the age of fifteen. The instructors told me I could emote more with my wrists and palms than most classically trained thespians could with the whole of their bodies. I graduated at the top of my class and received invitations from several of the most renowned touring companies. I traveled the globe. By the age of seventeen, I had performed for two kings and six queens. But it was never what I wanted. I didn’t want to be a sock puppeteer like father and like all of our uncles, like grandfather before them, like you.
And I told father so. When he found me at my drawing table and asked what it was I was scribbling, I confessed everything: that the pretense under which I had returned home–to found my own sock puppet theater–was untrue; that I wanted no longer to act with socks but make my own socks, socks that, in their design alone, possessed as much vibrant life as could be instilled by a skilled sock puppeteer.
Father did not appreciate this, of course. He scoffed at my plans. He told me that out there, beyond the cardboard walls of a sock puppet theater, socks were not lauded but ridiculed. He said there was no such thing as a vibrant life-affirming sock out there. He said they were simple and drab, a mere treaty between foot and shoe.
Moreover, he said I have two options: I must either cast my designs into the fireplace and resume my pursuit of sock puppetry, or forever be banished from his house. As the opening this letter has surely confirmed, I have chosen the latter. I will be traveling far away from here, all the way to the Americas.
So, fare thee well, brother. While it is unlikely that our paths will cross again, perhaps someday you will be in clothing store and you will see a brand of exciting colorful socks with my name upon them and know I have lived my dream.
Yours,
Ezekiel"	0.05			2018-08-22T04:00:07.337Z	0.3287164649283502	0.94	61717			0.03937749319454194	0.07019466178157474

What we’ve got here are some little mystery grab-bags containing cute-ified versions of your favorite (or least favorite) WWE wrestlers. As with each of these Order/Hoarder sales, we like to provide a little math breakdown: for $5, you can get 8 packs of them, which comes out to 63 cents each. On the other hand, you could get 64 packs for just $20. That’s 31 cents each, right? WRONG! Since you can only order 8 or 64, the first 8 cost $5, and the last 56 cost $15, which means those last 56 are costing you just about 27 cents each! That’s one quarter and two pennies! And when you consider that each pack contains 2… that’s less than 14 cents per wrestler!
And if you’re like, “why would I need 128 of these things?” here are a few helpful suggestions:


Put a bowl of them at the end of your desk at work, and if anyone asks you why, just say, in as condescending a voice as possible: “It’s healthier to hold a tiny wrestler than it is to eat candy.”


Give them away at your kids’ parties. Do you kids and their like wrestlers? Great! They’ll love these things. Do they not like wrestlers? That’s okay too. They won’t know who any of these people are and you can just call them L’il Fun Buddies or something.


Isn’t it about time your little Christmas village got some extreme new residents?


Glue them to your dashboard and let them intimidate you into being a better driver.


Carry them around with you and conduct a social experiment called: how many random people on the street will catch a little wrestler when you say to them: hey you, catch this little wrestler?


You do realize it’s only 71 days till Halloween, right?

At $49, this has got to be the most expensive backpack we’ve ever sold. And for that reason it’s not going to be for everyone.
And we don’t just mean if you’re not into GoPro stuff. Because, yes: it has a Go-Pro mount, as well as a padded crushproof compartment to hold 3 GoPros and a bunch of GoPro related gear. But even if you’re not into capturing your various thrill-seeking adventures on video, there’s still plenty of use here. It’s sturdy, lightweight, and features a variety of useful compartments, such as built-in fanny-pack pockets on the waist-belt in which you can stash your phone or anything else you need close at hand.
But yeah: if you just need a backpack that does only what its name implies–a pack to put on your back–then you probably don’t want to spend $49. Not even for one that has mostly 5-star reviews (and nothing lower than a 4) on Amazon…
On Amazon. On… Amazon…
Why does that seem relevant?
Oh, we know: it’s because, while we’re selling it for $49, it actually retails for just north of $100 over there. And so all these people who are saying “Awesome bag” or “I LOVE THIS PACK” or “Bag is amazing” or simply “Perfect”–they’re happy to have spent three-figures on these thing!
They could’ve put that money towards two week’s worth of groceries or a few gas tank’s worth of gas or a few months of internet or a vending machine snack every Monday through Friday for a third of the year, but instead they spent it on a bag. And not only did they not regret it; they LOVED it.
Our point is: it must be a pretty good bag. Our other point is: at least we’re selling it for half as cheap as elsewhere."	0.05			2018-08-20T04:00:03.040Z	0.345231304974333	0.92	70757

Let’s just get right to the basic question here: what is so damn smart about these Smart Stands?
“Smart” has come to be synonymous with “online” or “connected to wifi.” But these Smart Stands are neither. They are an amalgamation of plastic and hinge. There is no voice control or app so you can manage it while you’re on vacation or built-in analytics to tell you how you might best use it in the future, based on your past trends. They just sit there and holds up your tablet or phone.
And maybe in that way they’re the smartest of “smart” products: because they’re smart enough to know what they do well, and also to know what they don’t need to do.
The past is a veritable web of failed innovations. Just like no one wanted pasta from Panera or personal pizzas from Subway, nobody’s pining for some bullshit half-functional beta-level technology to do something that was already extremely simple. Being “smart” is not just creating new complicated functions to prove you can; it’s pausing before you do all the work and asking, “Wait, why are we doing this? Is this actually necessary?”
But you know who didn’t skip that step? Smart Stands. They asked, “Why?” And they said, “Because sometimes you want your tablet to be up like this rather than down like that.” And then they asked, “Should we go further?” And they decided: “No, because the further we go, the more we risk losing our greatest asset, which is that our stands are universally compatible with all phones and tablets.”
See, sometimes intelligence is knowing when to stop and say, “Good enough for me.” Which is why these smart stands are good enough for you, no matter what kind of device you prefer."	0.07			2018-08-19T04:00:02.021Z	0.46941764127665553	0.94	53660			0.024072699552649

Yes, we mentioned the blender bottles sale from a couple Saturdays ago in yesterday’s write-up, but we were mostly talking about the bottles themselves. Today, we’d like to talk about the sale.
See, that sale was an experiment. We offered two choices: a rational number of bottles (the 4-pack) for a good price; or an irrational number of bottles (the 16-pack) for an even better price, with no middle ground. We wanted to know, could we bait you into making a totally ridiculous purchase just by making you feel like you’d gotten a ‘great deal’?
The answer, in a fair number of cases, was ‘yes!’ And so here we are again.
Now, before we get to the product, we need to name this as-of-today recurring sale type. Some ideas:
The Excess Express: Because like an express train, there are few stops between where you should go and the end of the line!
DTB: Does it stand for “Down to buy”? Nope! It’s “Direct to Basement.” Because you don’t need to pretend you’re actually going to use all this stuff! Take one out, deposit the rest downstairs with all the other stuff you thought was a good investment!
Any or Many: Pretty self-explanatory. Other option, along these lines: “More or Less.” Other other option, along these lines: “Deal or Mo’ Deal.”
Irrational Numbers: Are these deals really that much like the mathematical concept of irrational numbers? Yes–because the logic of either is hard to explain–but also no–because only one of them will make you feel smart.
(Also, hello nerds, who are right now gearing up to compose some long screed in the comments about how, well, actually, it’s not that difficult at all to explain irrational numbers!)
Anyway, you can vote on those on today’s poll (and give your own suggestions). Who knows! Maybe if this works, we’ll have a whole spin-off site where do only this kind of deal! Eh?!
As for today’s product, here’s some info: they’re power banks, so it’s not exactly as impractical to have a bunch of them as it was with the blender bottles. Also, we sold something that looks like these before, with the shoe sole pattern, but these are the 6000mAh version, whereas last time they were 9000mAh. On the plus side: that means they’re smaller. On the downside: that means they have less charging capacity (each one can carry enough power to charge the average phone about 3 full times, rather than 4 with the other version).
But really, what’s important is THE DEAL! Because think about: at 2 for $12, that’s $6 per power bank. Not a bad price at all. BUT if you opt for 10, and assume that the first 2 cost $6 each, that means the last 8 cost just $24, or a mere $3 each! And if you go deeper and consider that each of those 8 is rated at 6,000 milliamp hours, that means that you’re only paying $0.0005 per mAh! And $0.0005 is basically nothing, and a lot of nothing is still nothing, therefore, WE’RE PRETTY MUCH GIVING THESE THINGS AWAY!
Okay, maybe we kind of flubbed up the logic there. But the question remains: do you want a boring old 2-pack of Xsories 6000mAh Power Banks for $12 or an amazing 10 for $36?!"	0.07			2018-08-18T04:00:05.333Z	0.3572084668612603	0.93	53049			0.024494294870486415

You probably saw the word “blender” and the word “bottle” and thought, why do I need this thing when I just received my 4 or 16 pack of blender bottles? But the products are actually very different. For example, the blender bottles we sold before were both blenders and bottles, whereas this is a blender that comes with two vessels for blending that are themselves bottles.
Or, to put it differently:
The blender bottles are bottles that can blend things inside the bottle, whereas this is a blender that blend things inside one of the two bottles that come with it (or more than two, if you order more than one blender, in which case, you simply need to multiply the number of blenders you order by two to ascertain the number of bottles, which again, are not blender bottles, but bottles that work with this blender).
But here’s the thing: even if you ordered the blender bottles, you can still order this blender and bottles, because the blender and the blender bottles (not to be confused with the bottles that come with the blender) can be used together (although, obviously, the blender and the bottles it comes with can be used together too). See, blender bottles we sold a couple weeks ago, having only a small metal ball rather than a blade or a motor (like this blender has), aren’t really great at being blenders, but they are good at whisking things (so maybe they should be called ‘whisker bottles,’ although on second thought, maybe not, as that sounds like something altogether different and unappealing).
Point is, you could use the blender–this one, the one with a motor and a blade–for more intense blending jobs, like making a fruit smoothie. Then, you can pour the smoothie from the blender’s blending bottle into a blender bottle and take it with you wherever you’re going, so that you can whisk it back together if it settles.
What we’re saying is that what you should really do is buy this blender and two bottles and then pour the things you make in the blender’s bottles into one of your blender bottles, while using the bottles that come with the blender just for the initial blending.
Unless you didn’t buy the blender bottles. In which case, disregard the above."	0.05			2018-08-17T04:00:10.364Z	0.30912710887561573	0.94	60832

Well, this is a first from our branded content romance novel collection: a teenaged paranormal love story! Please enjoy these excerpts of The Heart Races Until It Rests by Annborny Hilledale.

Ellie met Henri while running.
She was not looking for love. When she’d quit the cheerleading squad to join cross-country, her boyfriend Brad, the quarterback of the school’s football team, dumped her because her running gear didn’t look “as hot.” She was relieved more than anything. She was a senior and she had decisions to make: did she want to go to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Oxford, or one of the other ivy league schools she’d gotten into?
Really, Ellie wanted to got to a small liberal arts school and study poetry, but it wasn’t up to her. Both her mother and her father were founders and CEOs of very powerful companies, and they’d both fought so much about whose company Ellie would eventually take over that they’d gotten a divorce. The only thing they could agree on anymore: Ellie had to study business.
Her Polar Heart Rate Monitor beeped helpfully to let her know her heart rate had risen above her optimal zone. Ellie often ran too fast when she got anxious about the future.
She slowed down, which was when the boy appeared at her side. ‘Appeared’ because Ellie hadn’t seen him approach. “Good day!” he said with a smile. He looked about her age but also–Ellie couldn’t exactly describe it–almost sepia-toned? He wore a strange antiquated cotton shirt and cotton shorts and his shoes appeared old-fashioned, with almost no support. “The name is Henri. I’ve just begun to undertake the task of what I’ve heard referred to as ‘cardiovascular activity’ and I was wondering if you might allow me to accompany you!”
Ellie looked at her Polar Heart Rate Monitor again. Its easy-to-read screen let her know that she’d reached her workout goal for the day. “Sorry. I’m actually just wrapping up.”
Henri looked at his shoes, disappointed. “I understand,” he said.
“But tomorrow,” Ellie heard herself say. She didn’t know why. There was something interesting about him. “I’ll pick you up at your house and we’ll go for a jog. Where do you live?”
“Just past 229 Healy Street.” Something seemed to occur to Henri. “But upon a secondary thought, t’wouldst it be possible to meet right here?”
Ellie agreed. The plan was set.

For all his grandstanding about not understanding ‘cardiovascular activity’ Henri never seemed to get tired. They talked the whole way about classic poetry. Henri was very familiar and spoke about the poets in a funny way. Like with his look, Ellie couldn’t exactly place the strangeness of his tone except to say it seemed that he often spoke as if he knew the poets personally. She chalked it up to an affect, of which Henri had plenty!
“What is that strange jewelry you wear?” he asked at one point.
“This? It’s my Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Its convenient display makes it easy to track my total calories burned per session as well as provide a weekly training summary.”
“Is it expressly designed for this very activity?”
“Nope! It’s great for biking, circuit training, or even just walking. Here do you want to try it on?”
“Oh, that’s not necessary–” Henri started to say, but Ellie had already stopped and slipped it off her wrist. Had this all been a ploy to take his exceedingly pale wrist into her hand? Did she have a growing desire to touch him? Perhaps, but Henri seemed uncomfortable, and they ran the rest of the way in silence.
Later, when she uploaded the data easily to her free profile at polarpersonaltrainer.com by way of her Polar Flowlink, she noticed something odd. The data for her run was there, but around the time she put the watch on Henri, all heart rate readings went blank.
“Huh,” she said. “Must be an issue with the monitor.” But her Polar Heart Rate Monitor had always worked flawlessly before…

It kept happening. Each day, the Polar would continuously display her own heart rate, and when Henri would wear it for the second half of their run–something Ellie insisted on, as a means of testing its functionality–there would be no reading.
But she didn’t know how to tell him something was wrong. Just as they managed to remain in the optimal zone for burning fat thanks to the Heart Rate Monitor, so too did it feel as if they were always in the optimal zone for conversation. She could tell Henri anything and he seemed to understand: about her parents, about her college decision, or about her day at school (from which he was conspicuously absent).
Finally, one day she couldn’t help it.
“Henri,” she said. “I need to tell you something. I’m in love with you.”
“And I need to tell you something,” Henri said. “Ellie, I’m a ghost. The ghost of Henri Olson, a long forgotten poet who died in his teens.”
Ellie should’ve been surprised, but somehow she wasn’t. “So that’s why your heart rate never showed up.”
“Alas!” he cried. “But if it could, it would read a number so high, as just the sight of you sets me aflutter! You see, I have unfinished business, Ellie. I have never felt love.”
“Never?”
“You must understand: it was a different time when I was born. We weren’t worried about heart rates. If we could have such a glorious device as that Polar when I was growing up, it would not measure calories but risk of scarlet fever. In such a dangerous time, can one ever feel true love? I say no, despite writing so many poems about it. But with you Ellie, well I’ve been trying to deny it. To admit so much would be to finish my unfinished business…”
“Just kiss me,” Ellie said. She leaned forward with her eyes closed and their lips met. She tasted no salty sweat on his lips, despite that the Polar Heart Rate Monitor said they’d really been pushing themselves. But of course she wouldn’t. Ghosts didn’t sweat, not even beautiful ones.
In the moment before she could open her eyes, Henri whispered: “Ellie, I love you.”
Ellie found herself alone on the road.

The dean of the English department at the small idyllic Halpern College ushered Ellie into his office. She didn’t wear her Polar Heart Rate Monitor because she was afraid her rapid nervous heartbeat would set off an alarm.
“It’s quite unusual,” the dean said, “for a freshman to win our annual award for gothic poetry, but the imagery you’ve presented–of the final kiss, of riding your bike past his supposed address and finding a graveyard, all of it–it’s just so lovely. Such a wonderful imagination.”
“You could call it that,” Ellie said.
“So I’m pleased to say, as your reward, we will purchase any book for the library in your name. Now, don’t be afraid to take some time to think it over–”
“The Collected Works of Henri Olson.”
The dean cocked his head to the side. “I don’t think I’ve heard of him?”
“He died very young,” Ellie said, pretending to rub her eye to wipe away a tear. “But he–I mean, his poems–they were really quite lovely.”"	0.05			2018-08-16T04:00:03.517Z	0.23418002803322968	0.94	61944

Friends, before reading further, lock your doors, turn on all of the lights, and gather your pets and loved ones tight, because the following is a horror story.
We begin with a young man. Let us give him a name. Let us call him Sean.
This all happened some years ago, when Sean was just a naive young man who believed, due to being brought up in the Northeast within proximity to a certain corporate food chain, that donut shops could be relied upon for iced coffee. It was this misunderstanding that will ultimately lead to our story’s tragic end. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Sean, walking the streets of Seattle on a hot summer afternoon, entered a donut shop–not one of the fancy ones you may have heard of; a small, out-of-the-way place that will remain nameless–and asked the man behind the counter, “Do you have iced coffee?”
The man replied, “Yes, we have iced coffee.” Or no, that’s not it. That’s not it at all. What he said was: “Yes, I can do iced coffee.”
This should’ve been the tell, the sign that something was amiss and Sean should flee that donut shop. But he ignored the portents. He removed a small bill and said, “Great, I’ll have an iced coffee then.”
What happened next is almost too gruesome to put into words.
Almost.
The man behind the counter took a large styrofoam cup, filled it with ice, and proceeded to pour hot coffee from the pot directly over it, handing Sean, to his horror, a lukewarm watery mess.
But do not grieve for Sean. Do not shed one single tear over his ruined attempt to seek cold caffeination. For Sean is a complex protagonist, and he is not without blame here.
Because why was he even seeking to purchase an iced coffee in the first place? Why was he not buying beans in bulk and then using this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Bundle to make his own deliciously smooth and delightfully cheap iced coffee at home? Perhaps, if he had, the day before, loaded up the 1.6 qt. cold brew carafe–or the bottle, which he could’ve carried with him–he might have avoided such a cruel fate.
As is the case with many stories of terror and woe, this is a cautionary tale. Do not, dear reader, make the same mistake Sean made. Buy this bundle and live forever in cold coffee bliss."	0.05			2018-08-15T04:00:09.341Z	0.31881841989687204	0.93	65238

Children.

They were given a tube made of glass–the most satisfying of all smashables–filled with a weird, perhaps even delicious-looking, red substance.
Kids these days have it easy.
Or do they?
My mom, a nurse, always had a cupboard in the bathroom stocked with the most up-to-date medical paraphernalia. Therefore, we had a digital thermometer from the beginning. It was nice. Like this one, no mercury. Like this one, an easy straightforward digital readout of your temperature. Unlike this one, it took what felt like a half-hour to give a final verdict on whether or not you’d reached that magical realm north of 98.6 and earned the day off from school. And so, it wasn’t uncommon for the temperature-taker to put the thermometer in the child’s mouth and then walk away to take care of something else, allowing the child freedom to manipulate, through a variety of means, the final result.
This is hypothetical, of course. I would never have done such a thing.
(Oh, and also, just an FYI: that whole 98.6 being the average human temperature thing is the result of tests conducted by one doctor using a crummy armpit thermometer in the 19th century and is mostly bullshit.)

On day one, we sold a Roomba. That was in July, 2014. In the last 5 months of that year–our first 5 months of operation–we sold 5 more Roombas. We sold one or two in 2015. Since then, nothing. No more Roombas…
UNTIL TODAY!
What’s the best metaphor to capture the excitement of our reunification? Perhaps we could think of ourselves as a once famous rock band who amicably splintered to pursue our solo careers. We would certainly be the experimental-minded keyboardist, doing avant-guard work with help of speaker docks and vacuum sealers, whereas the Roomba would be the pop-forward frontman, producing hit after hit, each one more-or-less the same.
And now comes our glorious reunion tour!
(Although, now that I think about it, don’t bands usually reunite when the “well has run dry,” so to speak? As in: a last ditch effort to regain their former wealth or reputation?)
How about a different metaphor: in the 2015 we let the Roomba go off to clean, and now, after many years of service to the greater world, it’s made its circuitous way back to Meh, its noble charging port!
Nice pivot, eh?
Anyway, as we implied above, in the time since we last sold a Roomba, there have been, by our estimation, 6,000 new models released, all of which look almost exactly the same. So, if you’re wondering why you should buy this Roomba instead of a different Roomba, we are too.
But here’s what we gathered from these helpful breakdowns over at Vacuum Fanatics: the 805 is basically the base model of iRobot’s higher-end (though not highest end) 800 series of vacuum cleaners. It doesn’t have wi-fi like the 890, so it doesn’t work with Alexa or Google Assistant. Nor does it have the improved sensor capabilities of the 860. But it does have a lot of the other things that make those models great, such as a big bin and an AeroForce High Efficiency Filter, meaning the air that passes through it comes out a lot cleaner (which could be a big deal for allergy sufferers).

When the employees arrived at their first day at the new NOTILUS headquarters, they noticed something strange.
“There is no roof,” one of them said.
“Exactly,” said one of the higher-ups. “It’s an open-roof open-office.”
“But we won’t be protected from the rain,” said another employee.
“Exactly,” the higher-up said again.
The building had tile floors and was equipped with a siren. It sounded whenever a storm approached, at which point, the employees took the tarps provided to them and covered their computers, their phones, anything that could succumb to water damage. Then, they stood. They closed their eyes. They waited for the rain to wash over them so that they could understand it, become one with it.
Thus, when they engineered their shower heads to have 6 settings including “Wide Rainfall” and “Power Rain,” they knew these to be the true to their names. And when they built dual-zone antimicrobial jets that did not clog, it was not only to provide their customers with consistently strong water pressure; it was to mimic the rain that, year after year, never ceased to lessen in its strength.

The great philosopher Zaza Pachulia once said: “Nothing easy.” He was referring to the 8th seed Atlanta Hawks forcing a game seven against the 1st seed Boston Celtics, but his words are applicable to so many things in life. For us, there is “nothing easy” about balancing our standards for honest copy with our desire to offer a diverse range of products. Some days, it just seems untenable. And friends, today is one of those days. Because if I gave my 100% honest opinion of this ProCabello Straightener and Styler Kit it would be this:
IDK, it looks good to me, I guess.
See, I don’t actually know. I’ve never used a hair straightener, nor can I foresee a scenario arising in the future where I will either. Then again, this isn’t my first rodeo. There’ve been plenty of products I don’t particularly care about, and when they come up, there’s a simple solution: lean on the Amazon reviews.
Unfortunately this doesn’t help me much here, because the reviews, while positive (and that’s despite the significantly higher price point WITHOUT the “Shine and Hold Spray” we’re including), say very little.
For example, here is Diane Camargo’s review in full:

Love it!! The best flat iron I’ve used

And Karen Tucci writes:

Awesome flat iron. Heats up super fast. Has multiple heat settings. Very happy with my purchase.

And Adrian Blake Hammonds writes:

I love the way my hair feels.

Is it good to see such positive reviews of the item we’re selling? Sure. Do these reviews help me, as a copywriter, find an interesting angle for my write-up? No. Did I include three of them when one would suffice simply to push the write-up further down the page, thus making it appear longer? Of course. Unless it’s @Dave asking, in which case, no way! I did it for integrity!
Really the point is, it’s difficult to write about something without any personal attachment to even the concept of it. That’s why so much copy looks like… well… copy. But that’s not what we want. Likewise, we can’t just sell the stuff we know how to write about. We need to sell items that are outside of our comfort zone sometimes. Are they outside of the greater Meh community’s comfort zone, too? Maybe. Only time (and all of the graphs at the bottom of the page) will tell.

We’ve got another weird item pedaling vague impossible-to-prove pseudo-science, so that means another installment of THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE: a feature wherein we lay out the product’s claims and explain why we’re not so sure we believe them. Here goes!
The Claim
The Pure Daily Care Diffuser is the “ultimate starter pack for essential oil enthusiasts.” The various botanical oils are “100% pure” and also “100% organic” with “no fillers or additives.” All of this is fairly simple. Where it gets more interesting is in laying out the benefits of each included oil:

Peppermint is a “mental stimulant” that “provides energy”;
Orange is a “respiratory stimulator, antiseptic, antidepressant, aphrodisiac, and neural stimulator”;
Tea Tree is a “powerful immune stimulator”;
Lemongrass is “neural stimulator” that “soothes aches and pains while also reducing anxiety”;
Lavender is another “neural stimulator” that “reduces stress and anxiety and promotes restful sleep”;
and Eucalyptus is a “respiratory booster” and is “great for relieving sinus congestions.”

The Skepticism
Perhaps I shouldn’t call myself skeptical here. I’m not skeptical. I think this is bullshit, and moreover, I think it’s pretty dangerous. Not the diffuser itself, but the language.
Because eucalyptus oil will not relieve sinus congestion in a meaningful way. And lemongrass oil isn’t going to help with your sore joints. And orange oil is as much an antidepressant as the two day old styrofoam tub that held raw chicken in the trash is a depressant. By which I mean: walking into a house that smells bad sucks, and therefore will make you feel unhappy; so, conversely, walking into a house that smells good doesn’t suck, thus making you happy by contrast.
This is all to say that if you have sinus issues, or joint pain, or depression, don’t just buy a diffuser. See a doctor.
But again, this is an issue of language, specifically language that makes empty promises. The actual truth is essential oil diffusers are great. They don’t smell as fake and chemical-y as plug-ins. They’re not smokey like incense. It’s kinda cool to watch the mist rise out of them. And this one has 7 neat ambient light settings.
That’s why my wife and I are buying one: not for any medical reasons, but because we just moved into a new house and we want it to smell okay. Even when I forget to take out the trash…
In Conclusion
Diffusers are actually pretty nice, as long as what you’re looking for is a good smell, and not a cure."	0.05			2018-08-08T04:00:06.259Z	0.21768616353254416	0.94	62973

It’s been a while since we’ve been able to dip into our library of branded content romance novels, but luckily, we found one that just happens to involve today’s product. Get ready for a tale of desire and medical emergencies in these excerpts from Gene Harmony’s Love Is A Medicine Best Served At The Appropriate Temperature(s).

People were always asking Dale to open jars because of his amazingly strong arms. And people were also always asking why, when he could so easily be a model, he chose to work at the front desk of a pharmaceuticals lab. “Not everyone wants to be on the runway,” he’d say with a smile of clean white teeth that reinforced his model-like qualities. The real answer, though, was that he’d always had the desire to save lives. Working here, where so many important medications were developed, was the closest he could get.
Dale wasn’t the only one in the lab whose good looks were surprising. Rumor had it that Dr. Liza modeled to pay her way through graduate school on the way to becoming the world’s foremost expert on life-saving drugs. Whether that was true or not, Dale had to admit: she was beautiful. Even now, as she rushed up to the desk in her lab coat, clearly flustered, she looked exquisite.
Dale thought maybe she was coming to flirt, something that happened often, though nothing ever came of it. She was a lauded scientist, after all, and he a lowly receptionist. But flirting was not on the agenda today.
“Can I ask a big favor?” she said. “No one else is available to help and there’s a patient in need of an experimental medication. We have to get to the hospital, so it can be safely administered. Could you give me a ride?”
“No problem,” Dale said, standing.
“But there is a problem,” Dr. Liza said. “It’s a complicated medication, comprised of three very volatile liquids that cannot be combined until the last possible minute before being administered. Also, each substance must be kept within a certain temperature range. If I leave them in their test-tubes, they’ll grow too warm or too cold on the ride over.”
“I have just the thing,” Dale said.

Dale and Dr. Liza carried the four Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs out to his car: three filled with temperature controlled substances, one extra, “Just in case,” Dr. Liza had said.
“We need to be careful with these,” she said now, but it was not an issue at all, given that the Primulas’ contemporary attractive twist-textured design allowed for a secure grip. Not to mention they were splash-resistant! “And you’re sure they’re not contaminated?”
“Absolutely,” said Dale. “It’s very easy to clean the mugs themselves. And I put the lids through my dishwasher at home, on the top rack, where it’s safe for them to go.”
Dale could tell that Dr. Liza, though still nervous, was happy to hear this. And she was even happier when she saw that all four mugs fit into the various front- and back-seat cup-holders of Dale’s modest hatchback. “Like a glove,” she murmured to herself. “Maybe I’ll be okay after all.”
“What’s that?” Dale said.
But Dr. Liza didn’t repeat herself.

They’d left the lab an hour ago. The hospital was only five miles away. Yet, they found themselves only halfway there, stuck in unmoving bumper-to-bumper traffic. The reprieve in Dr. Liza’s anxiety, brought on by the various positive aspects of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs, proved temporary. Out of the corner of his eye, Dale had watched her grow more and more upset–first sitting straight up, then tapping her fingers on the dash and sighing loudly.
When she finally spoke, her voice cracked with fear. “It’s no use. We’re getting nowhere. We need to administer the medication now.”
“But how are we going to do that?” Dale said. “The patient is at the hospital.”
“No, I said we need to go to the hospital so they can administer it safely. The patient isn’t there. Not yet. She’s here. Dale, it’s me.”
“What?!”
“Look at me, Dale,” Dr. Liza said. “You’re going to have to administer the drug that’ll save my life from the disease I’ve kept a secret all these months.”
“But, but…”
“There are no buts about it,” Dr. Liza said. She pointed to one of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs. “See that Primula 20oz Insulated Mug? You told me that–with its double walls, vacuum seal, and triple-layer Copper Cold Technology–it can keep liquids hot for up to 8 hours and cool for 24. It makes sense that you’d have such a mug, because you’re a lot like it. You want to save lives. I’ve seen it in your eyes, and like a giant beautiful man-shaped Primula 20oz Insulated Mug, you keep that desire at the appropriate temperature so that it never dies.”
Dale nodded. She was right. He’d waited his whole life for this. Without a word, he got the empty Primula and carefully mixed the contents from the others together in it. “Now, what do I do?”
“It needs to be applied to my lips,” Dr. Liza said. “But first, it requires vermilion stabilization, meaning it must be applied to a healthy pair of lips, and then transferred from those lips to the taker’s.”
Dale understood what he must do. He gravely opened the easy-open, easy-close lid. It was straw-compatible but he didn’t need one now. He let the liquid touch his lips, and then he leaned over the center console to Dr. Liza…

Dale paced. He held a Primula 20oz Insulated Mug. He had cleaned it and filled it with coffee from the hospital waiting room two hours ago when he arrived, and it was still hot.
Finally, the doctor appeared. “She’s recovering,” he said, “thanks to that experimental drug she made and thanks to your administering of it. Still, to be safe, we’ll give her regular doses of it every four hours.”
“And how will you give it to her?” Dale said, feeling strangely jealous. “Do you have a machine for vermilion stabilization?”
The doctor looked at him, confused.
“You know,” Dale said. “It needs to be applied from healthy lips to the lips of the diseased.”
“It’s taken orally, son,” the doctor said. Then a sly grin came across his face. “If I had to wager a guess, I’d say someone has a crush on you!”"	0.05			2018-08-07T04:00:06.333Z	0.5387061168679262	0.92	64187			0.11531935223472428

“Do not cast your pearls before swine.”
People spoke these words without thinking, for a moment, of how they would hurt me, a pig. But more than speak them, they lived by them. Every time I walked into a jewelry store, they quickly rushed to put away their finest pearls.
I told them, “But it is me. I am not a descendent of some clown like Porky. My grandfather built the first ever wolf-proof house. He patented his  special structurally-sound brick-laying technique, and it has been used in the constructions of homes the country over, including three governors’ mansions. He passed his business down to my father who passed it down to me, and now, my net worth is somewhere in the high nine-figures. So please, allow me to purchase the great jewels of the sea.”
Still, I received nothing.
Then, one day, I saw a New Yorker cartoon. One dog sat on the floor, listening to another, seated at a computer.

The jewels look pretty much like a silver band from any further than a foot away, which is maybe a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preference.
They make a big deal about how they are designed for the minuscule ears of women, which I thought was just goofy marketing. But I’ll be honest, none of the 5 tip sizes really worked for my brutish masculine ears.
I was, however, able to get some tips from a previous pair onto them (with a little coaxing).
All-in-all, a very solid buy. If I didn’t already have 2 pairs, I’d buy some more as backup.

You get 2 pairs of Maroo ICE Headphones, but when you receive them, you might think you accidentally ordered 8. Because despite their “smaller fit for women’s ears,” these things come in an unnecessarily big and complicated box. User @Chakolate sums it up pretty nicely:

What is a problem is the amount of packaging. The unopened package is 223 grams, of which 11 grams are the actual headphones. They come in a jewelry-type velvet box, which is nestled in a lot of plastic, which is inside a thin cardboard box, which is wrapped in tissue paper. They also include a carry pouch, and a thick little book about how to use them. (Seriously? They’re kidding, right?) The end package is about 8x3x3"", which is absurd for headphones.

And in case you need some idea of how big that actually is, here’s a picture.

For context, the can next to it is 16 ounces. It’s also a delicious hazy New England style IPA as good as any I had back east from the best brewery in Des Moines! (In case anyone from Confluence is reading and wants to give me some swag.)
Now, you’re probably thinking: “All that stuff for some bedazzled earbuds? What a waste!” But you’re not looking at the big picture. All the various packaging materials are not simply for this product; they’re for a bunch of different things we’ve sold over the course of the last year. For example:


You can cut up the plastic casing and put them in your Ray Ban Eyeglasses when one of the lenses breaks.


You can use the jewelry case to hold your Diamond Encrusted Eternal Heart-Shaped Pearl earrings.


You can use the pouches for safe transport of your WWE TeenyMates.


And you can use the tissue paper when you move to wrap the little espresso cups you got to go along with your Nespresso Vertuo.


Because everyone buys every product we sell, right? That’s how this is supposed to work. We put up an item each day, and you, in turn, buy at least one of that item each day, but preferably two or three.
Wait… really? You only buy some things we sell?! So we can’t rely on every user buying every single product?!?!

Four Blender Bottles probably seems like plenty of Blender Bottles. You have your Blender Bottle, your backup Blender Bottle, a Blender Bottle to try weird stuff in, and a Blender Bottle to give away when your friend is like, “Oh, I should get a Blender Bottle like that.”
Sixteen Blender Bottles is probably too many Blender Bottles. Even if you’re very clumsy with your Blender Bottles, or very experimental, or have a lot of friends who want Blender Bottles, you’re still probably going to end up with a few leftover Blender Bottles.
So why should you get sixteen Blender Bottles?
Because it’s possible that this is the best ever deal on Blender Bottles. You’re probably thinking: sixteen Blender Bottles for $49? That’s about $3 per Blender Bottle. Not bad, right? But it gets even better, because really, if four Blender Bottles costs $20, that means you’re really getting twelve Blender Bottles at $29. So you’re looking at a cost of less than $2.50 per Blender Bottle after the initial four Blender Bottles.
(Which, side note, makes for a great conversation starter. The next time you have some friends over just point to the pile of Blender Bottles in the corner–and there will be a pile of them in the corner; you have sixteen of them, after all–and say, “See that Blender Bottle? That Blender Bottle only cost me $2.42.” Just, make sure you point to one of the last twelve Blender Bottles, not one of the first four Blender Bottles, because as we’ve established, those Blender Bottles cost more.)
With savings like that, can you really pass up buying sixteen Blender Bottles?
You can?

The FoodSaver conference room was tense. Nobody knew why the emergency meeting had been called except that it involved “a failure in marketing.”
Finally, Richard, the sixty year old exec who’d sent out the invite, arrived.
“Folks, we’ve got problems,” he said. “Our prized product, the Vacuum Sealing System, is being used for things other than saving food. Which is bad, because that’s our name. One thing they’re using it for is something called ‘Sous vide,’ which I believe is a religion, so we’ll want to be very careful there. But the other thing is–” Richard looked around, and spoke in a hushed tone–“they’re using it for marijuana.”
“They smoke through the machine?” asked Terry, age fifty-two.
“That’s what I thought at first,” Richard said. “But it turns out it’s more for storage and keeping it fresh. Anyway, there’s a whole bunch of people doing it. I found a message board where everyone was snap-chatting about it. The Red Edit.”
“It’s called Reddit,” said the intern, age twenty-one. “It’s the ‘trees’ subreddit.”
“Nope, that’s not it,” said Richard. “It’s definitely not about trees. Your generation wouldn’t understand because your Woodstocks were different. Anyway, we need to cash in on this, and we need to cash in on this NOW. We need a marketing campaign. Something to appeal to the youth.”
“But you just said my generation–”
“Quiet, intern. The adults are talking. Now, let’s spitball a little. What do we got?”
“What if,” said Tony, age fifty-eight, “we do one of those internet pictures and then make it go viral?”
“I like that,” Richard said. “That’s a good plan: a viral internet picture.”
“I’ve seen one particular internet picture,” said Harry, age fifty-eight, “where there’s a man pointing at a butterfly. The man will be labeled, and the butterfly will be labeled, but the man will be saying, ‘Is this a something-other-than-butterfly?’”
“Because it’s labeled as something else,” Richard said.
“No,” said Harry. “I should’ve mentioned that too. He doesn’t call it what it’s labeled, either. He calls it something else. I believe that’s part of the joke.”
“Okay, so,” said Terry, “we label the butterfly ‘FoodSaver’ and the man as ‘consumer’ and he’s asking: ‘Is this a thing for storing my reefer?’”
“Ganja,” said Tony. “Let’s say ‘ganja.’”
“Good catch,” said Richard. “We need to use relevant terms.”
“Also, underneath the question,” said Harry, “it should say, ‘Yes, and you can has it!’”
“That’s with the cat, right?” Richard said.
“No,” Terry said. “Cat says, ‘hang in there.’”
“Well, this has been very productive,” said Richard. “Good work, team. I’ll send this along to the design department. I’ll tell them to redraw the image in case there’s a copyright issue and to get us twelve potential samples by this afternoon.”
“You want the design department to make twelve images in a few hours?” asked the intern.
“Yes,” said Richard.
“But how?”
“They have computers,” Richard said. “It’s easy. And anyway, I don’t tell them how to do their jobs. Until I do. Now, intern, didn’t I put you on a special office sustainability project? I thought you kids love that stuff.”

But who? Yes, there are plenty of people out there who love jewelry, but these days the gift-giving season (at least in our experience) seems to be less about personal affects and more about technological advancement. You don’t get your mom earrings anymore; you get her a tablet. And you don’t get your grandmother a bracelet; you order her a Roku and help set up Netflix so she can watch her shows on an infinite loop without commercial interruption. So who are you buying this jewelry for?
You might not be able to think of anyone… and that’s exactly the point!
You’re forgetting somebody. Or maybe you’re not. Maybe you didn’t even realize Aunt Gilma was coming this year, after what happened at the Easter Parade. Or maybe you didn’t know Cousin Nick was bringing his girlfriend from college, or that he had a girlfriend at all, or that he was in college, and actually the more you think about it, the less you remember even having a cousin Nick. But that doesn’t matter. She’ll be there for the holidays, and come Christmas morning you don’t want her to have to sit awkwardly on the floor among the landscape of shredded wrapping paper with a big pile of nothing to bring home.
And jewelry is the perfect gift in this situation: a nice, attractive, inoffensive, break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option for that special someone in your life… that you totally spaced on.
In other words, it wouldn’t hurt to just have some around this time of year.

Yes, with each day there comes fewer hours of sunlight to warm things up. The numbers you saw on the right in the “low” column have begun their migration left, replacing the previously pleasant “high” temperatures. Thus, this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Maker and travel brewers might, you think, only be used a short time before they go into storage. Because brewing iced coffee in December is like the beverage equivalent of wearing shorts during a blizzard: something done, in states that experience a true winter, only by the extremest of die-hards and season deniers.
As one such person, I can confirm: we are a small, proud, devoted (if not somewhat delusional) group. But we also know a secret that few others seem to understand.
Before I get to that, though, let me clarify. The group I’m talking about is those who drink iced coffee year round. I claim not to know anything about the cold-legged shorts wearers. Although I do wear shorts in the winter months sometimes. For example, if I’m stuck inside and doing something active, like cooking or cleaning.
And this is exactly the secret I’m talking about: winter only happens outside!
Everywhere else, it remains warm enough to drink refreshing smooth cold brew. At home. At work. Even in the car. Actually, especially in the car, after you’ve given it some time to warm up, when it becomes basically a mobile sauna.
What’s funny is that this secret hides in plain sight. Think about it. Do you bake your salads in the winter? Do you pour a bottle of Coca Cola into the kettle and set it to boil? Do you say to the bartender, “I’ll have the IPA, but nuke it on high for 45 seconds”? Sure, a hot toddy, a nice soup, or a steaming mug of hot apple cider is nice. but even in February, these things aren’t as ubiquitous as a glass of cold water and a deli sandwich.
In other words, it’s totally easy to normal to drink cold brew coffee year round. The only tough part is when you walk from the warmth of your car to the warmth of your house or your office with your cold cup in hand.

Alexa can’t rake leaves, and she’s terrible with a leaf blower. Ditto for scraping the frost from your car’s windshield.
You can ask her to help bring the potted plants in from the porch, and she’ll refuse each time, regardless of how polite you are. As if she doesn’t understand SHE works for YOU!
Alexa can tell you the Bolivian city Oruro’s population. She can tell you who serves at its mayor, or what kind of climate it experiences. She can probably tell you its exact coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. But she has no fucking clue where you put your damn sweaters after you moved this past summer.

Sous vide cooking is fun. It’s weird. It’s a lot different than most basic cooking methods. And because of that, there are tricks you’re bound to pick up along the way, little ways to improve your food’s flavor, or methods that maybe make it just that much easier.
Still, you’re bound to have some blind spots. Cooking is like having a problem to solve, the problem of how to get all these ingredients into a cohesive “meal.” As such, everyone’s going to come at it from a different angle. And knowing how another person approaches something might help you figure out the best way for you to do things.

Dearest Martha,
I wish I could say that I miss you. Alas, to suffer only a heavy heart would be a great relief! The truth is much worse than that. I write this letter because I am in grave danger, and I fear that I will suffer not death, but something much worse: a living death of sorts.
Yes, “fear”: a word you likely never thought you would see your husband write. For eight months, I cohabited with wild gorillas. For eleven, I roamed with a pack of wolves. For three, I swam with electric eels. I was buried a whole year among the bulldog ants of Australia in an attempt to understand their tunnel structure. Never once, in any of those cases, did I feel even remotely afraid. But none of them compare to this.
Though it may void my contract with the research firm, I will give you the full details of my current assignment: I was sent to integrate myself into a community of EarPod wearers, so that I might discern once and for all what makes them such incredible assholes.
I have, for the last month, been living among them somewhere in the Bay Area in what I believe is an apartment, but also seems to be a concert venue and startup. The startup is focused on an app of some kind but no one here actually programs. They all work as “organic social marketing disruptors” though many also dabble, I’m told, in graphic design. They wear their EarPods always. And so do I.
This is what I mean by a living death, Martha. Since putting the EarPods in, I have begun to have thoughts that seem not to belong to me. At first it was just, PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT on a constant loop. But as I acclimated, I began to think things like It’s too bad the world isn’t as present as me, or My podcast is better than this one, or What idiot called these EarPods instead of Lil’ Listenies? The other day, I thought once again about them falling out, but this time, it was, If these EarPods fall out, what’s going to keep my head from floating away?

Unfortunately, I am not sure my exact address, so you will have to fly to San Francisco and look for posters for a show we are hosting, featuring a performance by an artist named Transl8. He does electro-folk, as well as politically-conscious trip-hop.
Also, please bring a pair of Rowkin Bluetooth Earbuds. Just as I needed to take measures in order to avoid the bends when I resurfaced after spending those weeks with the angler fish, so must I do the same now. And those Rowkins are stylish, wireless, and way less obnoxious than EarPods. They should return me to myself in no time.

Screenprint Sunday is back… or is it? Because we’re giving you an option this week: to logo or not to logo. That’s right, you can choose a 6-pack of fleece blankets with the Meh logo, or a 6-pack of fleece blankets with no logo at all.
So, on the one hand, this seems like a smart move for us. Not everyone wants a blanket printed with something, especially not a logo for a deal-a-day site. It can feel like you’re basically an advertisement.
On the other hand, it would be pretty insulting if you chose blank blankets over Meh-printed blankets. It’s the same price, so you’re basically saying, “I’d prefer not to be associated with you.”
On the other other hand, you’re saying you’d prefer not to associate with us every day you choose not to buy something.
On the other other other hand, maybe buying the blank blankets is more insulting, because you’re coming here, seeing what we’re selling, and saying, “We’re willing to take your blankets, but we don’t want to help you out with some free advertising.”
On the other other other other hand, you are paying us, which does help.
On the other other other other other hand, it’s not all about you. Or us. It’s also about what your friends and family members might want. Like, maybe they don’t prefer to use a blanket with a giant Meh logo on it.
On the other other other other other other hand, that leaves more blankets for you!
On the other other other other other other other hand, this is short term thinking. You might enjoy hoarding blankets now, but eventually the thrill will be gone, and you’ll be left with only blankets and no love. And besides, weren’t you just saying how lonely you were?
On the other other other other other other other other hand, no: it was not you who was lonely. It was me, the man with eight hands, six blankets, and no friends.
I hope this helps you decide which blankets to buy!"	0.07			2018-11-04T04:00:05.099Z	0.3967801951626992	0.94	56100

Think of your favorite Christmas mornings growing up: you woke up after barely sleeping, rushed to the tree, and tore open your presents. Then maybe came some reprieve–maybe you ate some pancakes and drank some hot cocoa–after which the real fun started: you spent the next several hours painstakingly assembling a tiny model from even tinier pieces so that it could sit atop your desk forevermore!
Okay, maybe that wasn’t exactly how it went. Probably, you played video games, or with some new action figures or dolls. Maybe you watched some movies on TV, maybe you ate more pancakes, drank some more cocoa, maybe you didn’t get out of your pajamas until four in the afternoon when it was time for Christmas dinner, and maybe you were ready for bed at seven, the calories and the sporadic sleep from the night before combining into a potent sleep aid.
And I wouldn’t blame you if that’s what you chose to do. Because those things are more enjoyable than building a model. But here’s something to think about: are they as satisfying?
Because there’s an important difference here. Yes, you might enjoy a candy bar more than taking a jog. Yes, you might enjoy bingeing ten seasons of some guilty-pleasure thriller on Netflix more than spending the afternoon preparing a five-course meal for your visiting relatives. And yes, you’re probably going to enjoy sitting around on the couch on Christmas overindulging in food, toys, and TV (or for adults: food, booze, and basketball) more than building the tiny model of the Eiffel Tower that you got in your stocking.
But you won’t be as satisfied.
Anyone who’s ever done anything requiring a modicum of will-power and ingenuity–even if only to solve a minor problem of their own making–knows that the accompanying frustration quickly gives way to a more lasting pride. Every deep breath you take all day will remind you of that jog. For weeks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment after making that meal. And while you might regret all of the pancakes and cocoa and movies and Christmas cookies well before December 26th, you will always be able to look at your model and think, with a smug sense of satisfaction, I did that.
And that is the greatest gift of all.

Ah yes, another gummy purporting to have some vague healing properties. Sounds like the perfect starting point for a rousing round of…
THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE
Here’s how it works: we give you the claim the product makes, explain why we’re more than a little dubious, and then in the end, we come to some conclusion (if ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ can be considered a conclusion). Let’s get started!
The Claim
CBD is “a natural constituent of hemp” that “has been shown to have positive health benefits.” But since it contains no THC, it won’t get you high. Thus, it supposedly can help treat stuff like pain and anxiety with less risk of endless philosophizing or nachos.
The Skepticism
Here are pretty much all of the things we can definitively say about CBD:

It is short for cannabidiol.

Did we get all that? Does anyone need anything repeated? In the back? Can you all hear me?
Okay, that’s a simplification. There’s more. For example, we also know that, like Hansel, this CBD shit is just so hot right now. According to a New York Times article by Alex Williams, Willie Nelson is launching a line of CBD-infused coffee beans (two of his favorite things in one cup, he says), Mandy Moore is toying with it to see if it helps relieve the pain of walking in heels, and Glamour magazine ran a story with the headline “I Replaced My Entire Beauty Routine With Only CBD Products.” I am linking it here as proof. I refuse to actually read it, which I consider an act of self-care.
But what does it actually… do? Gabe Kennedy a twentysomething CBD start-up founder offers this:

Comparing it to the feeling after an intense meditation or yoga session, Mr. Kennedy added that the CBD glow has “synergistic downstream effects” in terms of social connections. “Around others, I find myself more present and attentive, more creative and open.”

To put my reaction in terms that Mr. Kennedy’s ilk would understand, I’d say the ROI on reading that paragraph was that I experienced an exciting disruption in the mouth sector, which, had I not cupped my hand over my lips, might just have gone viral all over my keyboard.
But while it’s fun to mock the eye-roll parade that the article provides, it also validates the claim made by Christie Aschwanden over at FiveThirtyEight: “the marketing has gotten way ahead of the science.”
Aschwanden is definitely more focused on the what than the why. Her article’s thesis is pretty well summed up by its headline: “Does CBD Really Do Anything?” There are definitely some serious WTF moments in here too. For example, when CBD-pedaling doctor Joe Cohen makes the claim that it has anti-cancer properties and might even help with Alzheimers, Aschwanden raises concern that these effects weren’t discussed in two of the most significant cannabis-focused reports out there. The good doctor’s reply: “I think you just have to Google search it.”
Moreover, though, she raises some important points, most notably that we don’t have mixed messages when it comes to CBD; we have almost no messages at all, because very few tests have looked at it on its own:

Animal models and a few human studies suggest that CBD can help with anxiety, but those are the only conditions with much research on CBD in isolation.

Otherwise, most studies focus on cannabinoids more generally, where they have actually found “‘conclusive or substantial evidence’ supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain in adults, multiple sclerosis-related spasticity (a kind of stiffness and muscle spasms), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”
Though, this assumes you’re getting a real dose, which also seems to be up in the air:

There are no guarantees that the label accurately reflects what’s in the product. For a 2015 study published in JAMA, researchers tested 75 products [cannabis] purchased in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle and found that only 17 percent were accurately labeled. More than half of the products contained significantly lower levels of cannabinoids than the label promised, and some of them contained only negligible amounts of the compounds.

The Conclusion
When we promise something here, we hold ourselves to it, so here comes: after reading about CBD, we can say, conclusively, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . But actually, it seems not to be super risky and to have some potentially great outcomes. So if you’re feeling anxious or a little achy, give it a try. Like most of this stuff, if you don’t think of it as a cure-all, you should be fine."	0.06			2018-11-02T04:00:05.893Z	0.42612956253890216	0.93	66292

It’s easy to come up with jokes about these things, and not just because they’re called “Lovesac Sactionals.” Like, imagine replacing all of a friend’s furniture with these one night, so they awake and believe they’ve grown. Or imagine a business man who uses them in his office as a power move, so that whenever someone comes to meet with him, they have to sit crouched to the ground feeling small.
But really, this hilarious world I’m describing, where everything is out of proportion is actually what young kids experience all the time, just inverted.
As @Superllama7 helpfully points out, “kids and pets can also use adult-sized furniture.” This is true, of course. Yet adult-sized furniture doesn’t really give kids a sense of ownership. Kids have toys and books. They have a bedroom they might share, and a bed to sleep in. But rarely are they given their own little space for quiet comfort in daytime, which is too bad, because it’s something they might like.
@2palms’s daughter did, at least: “with the double-wide seat she can get a leg up, then camp out in the corner with her books.” If that sounds super cute, I’ve got news for you: it is. @2palms includes two adorable pictures of “quiet morning reading time” on one of the 2 “chaise lounges” they put together. (@2palms elsewhere describes the Sactional furniture’s sturdiness, in case that’s a concern).
We should add that this time around, we’re selling them a bit differently than we did in September. Instead of doing it piece-by-piece, we’re offering a few different packages. You can get:
2 Seats, 4 Sides: Great for the kid who will occasionally keep the company of a couple action figures, perhaps a teddybear, but also enjoys a quiet night in with a good (pop-up) book.

That’s ridiculous, Lucy. It’s 2018; you need furniture for casual get-togethers.
8 seats, 10 sides: Basically everything you need to build a simple playpen, except one that’s softer and won’t raise the ire of your interior decorator friends.
Are they incredibly practical? Probably not. But they’re nice, and who knows, maybe your kids have been jonesing for a little quiet, relaxing space to call their own."	0.05			2018-11-01T04:00:05.247Z	0.27079811590159353	0.91	64234

Ladies and gentleman, friends and enemies, lovers and fighters, today we offer you something incredible: control of our most essential invisible resource, the very air we breath.
Birds? They are mere riders of the sky, nothing more than hangers-on. Airplanes? For all of their ingenuity, their undeniable feats of engineering, they still must heed the air’s wishes. When the air says, I shall have a massive storm here, in your flight path, does the plane puff out its chest and cry, Not today, air! Your storm can wait? No! The plane says, Ah, yes sir, yes sir, whatever you prefer, air! We shall find a new way to where we are going! And if the air says, The storm will be massive; there is nowhere to go, the plane replies with a nervous laugh, and says, Of course, sir! Totally understandable, sir! Take your time, sir! We will be right down here on the ground if you need us, sir!
In other words, birds are nihilists and planes are weak-willed.
You are neither.
The air might find its way through some unseen passageway into your house in the dead of night, at the height of winter. And it may say to you, Behold my dryness! It may say, Watch, as your knuckles fissure and grow red! Watch as your skin flakes! Watch as your lips chap, even in here, where you thought you were safe from my wrath! It will cackle with bitter delight as it watches you apply lotion and balm, knowing they are like cheap bandaids in the shadow of its vengeance.
Then the air will feel something itself, a chill. But more than that: it will feel the slow in-creep of moisture. It will say, Is there some glitch in your heating and cooling system? And you will point to your Pure Enrichment Cool Mist Humidifier, and you will say, “No, there is no glitch at all.” Then you will say, “Now dance, air!” And it will cry tears of humidity, but it will dance!

I, Clive Grunley, am not a mere athlete. Nor a biathlete. Nor a triathlete or anything so simple. No sir, I am a sexdecathlete, if you know what I mean!
What I mean is I compete in competitions comprising of sixteen distinct athletic feats. Why do you look so surprised? Did you think a sexdecathlete was something else?
A traditional sexdecathlon begins with a twenty mile run (1). Next, is a swim of at least 4 miles (2), but additional miles can be swum to earn tokens which can be used to hire additional bridge builders to help you build the bridge (3) back over the body of water you just swam across.
After that comes the javelin toss (4), followed by a short sprint (5), in order so that you can catch the same javelin you just tossed (6), and then, while holding it aloft, discuss with several gifted undergraduates how the javelin can serve, in literature, as a metaphor for one’s ascension and subsequent decline (7).
This is followed by a water break, which is not a break as in a moment of reprieve, but another event wherein each competitor builds a mold, pours water into it, freezes it, and then breaks the sculpture upon the shoulder of a competitor before they have one broken over theirs (8). Those who lose are disqualified, and given a strong handshake by those continuing on (9).
Next, you chop down a tree (10), then climb at least halfway up the tree (11), and carve some part of the three into a surfboard (12) while it is falling, so that you have something to ride when your tree eventually lands in the wave pool. You then ride a wave (13) to the artificial “shore” wherein a meeting ensues among remaining competitors as to how you might maintain the tree-related events while also promoting sustainability (14).
Which leaves nothing to do but cross the finish line (15) and exchange high fives (16). Yes, these count as events, as the finish line is a moat filled with poisonous snakes and we call them high fives because they must be completed atop a nearby mountain of you and your high-fiving partner’s choosing.
Anyway, the point being: after a long sexdecathlon, I’m beat. And I need at least three Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Packs to sooth my aches. I especially like that the texture provided by the ceramic beads allows for a nice massage. And let me tell you, us sexdecathletes might all be different, but every one of us likes a good rub!

Four truths and three lies about the artist Adam Koford:


Adam Koford, as a shirt designer often under the moniker of “Apelad”, has sold more than 260 designs on websites like Shirt.Woot, including several that this former Woot copywriter often still thinks of and laughs aloud.


Adam Koford’s art studio is in a house boat currently floating in international waters, the only place he can execute his diabolical pencil hold without being taken into police custody.


Adam Koford was, for a time, a jockey. He and his horse Maple Syrup were dominant, winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. On the track of the Belmont Stakes, though, disaster struck. Just feet from the finish line, Maple Syrup collapsed in a cloud of gray smoke, at which point it was discovered Maple Syrup was not a horse at all, but a robot powered, at its center, by a tiny car driving on a tiny treadmill.


Adam Koford is the creator of Laugh-Out-Loud Cats, a webcomic which can be viewed at HOBOTOPIA.com, as well as in a new book, One More For The Road, COMING SOON (stay tuned to Hobotopia for an official announcement in a couple weeks). A few months ago, he posted his 3000th Laugh-Out-Loud cats drawing. And since pictures are each worth a thousand words, that means Koford has produced the equivalent of 3 million words, the equivalent of somewhere between 30 and 50 novels. That’s impressive!


Adam Koford opens bananas by making several exacting surgical incisions with a scalpel. The peel-removal process can take up to two hours, but according to Koford, it’s worth it. “If you respect the fruit,” he says, “it will in turn respect you by unlocking heretofore hidden flavors.”


Adam Koford has worked as a senior writer and story artist on the video game versions of Bolt, Toy Story 3, and Cars 2. Which means he can say things like, “I wrote Toy Story 3,” and not technically be lying!


Adam Koford designed today’s shirt.

There’s basic relief. And then there’s the relief of finding that perfect something you’ve been looking for: that hair gel that works just right with your hair; that pair of running shoes that seems to be custom-built for your unique foot shape; that cut of jeans that fits like a dream.

That little operation in your brain that you’ve been forever running in the background, looking for that special something, can be discontinued, the energy rerouted.

Many considered A Portal Among The Pages, published in 1978, to be the book that marked science fiction author Hal Pembry’s ascension from merely great into the canon. His previous seven novels to that point had been entertaining and thought-provoking, but few managed to evoke the magic that Portal  seemed to achieve so easily. As one reviewer wrote, “When Finley [the book’s protagonist] first finds the Encyclopedia of Time, he does not know that it functions essentially as a time machine, yet he senses something special between the covers. Readers might find this sensation quite relatable, as they sit in their favorite chair, holding Pembry’s masterwork aloft.”
His fans were eager to see what he would come up with next. And they were profoundly disappointed when the answer turned out to be: nothing. Pembry never wrote another book. In fact, he disappeared altogether. Many assumed he’d gone the way of other successful literary eccentrics–that the fame had been too much for him and so he’d retired somewhere quiet for a life of seclusion. Others posited that the terrible film adaptation had driven him to flee out of embarrassment. A small faction of particularly conspiracy-minded fans put forward a theory of murder at the hands of Kyle Tolliver, a rival author driven mad by jealousy because his own stellar novel’s release had been eclipsed by Portal (this being a pun many newspapers made while discussing the books’ relative sales, as Tolliver’s concerned a deadly solar eclipse).
None of these theories came close to the truth. In actuality, Pembry’s novel was a confession of what was to come: he’d discovered a way in which he could, through literature, bend time. I know because he told me when I spotted him last week outside of a used bookstore in Omaha. He did not look a day older than his author photo from forty years ago.
I asked what he thought of life in our current age and he said, “It’s okay. There are many things that science fiction foresaw, only different in minor ways. There are robots that work for you, but the one’s that move have no personality, and the ones with personality don’t move. They live in speakers and phones. And then there’s that.”
He pointed to the GOTRAX Hoverfly ECO Hover Board I had ridden up on.
“I’ve read all about those. About how their electrical safety is certified, about how they can go nearly 8 miles per hour and up to 12 miles distance before needing a charge. It’s truly a work of ingenuity. Only, when I and many of my contemporaries had imagined hover-vehicles, I thought they would truly hover. Again, it’s not that I’m unimpressed. Sometimes, I wish there was just a bit more whimsy. At any rate, I ought to be going.”
I asked him where and he corrected me. “It’s when,” he said, then told me to name a year. 1919 was what came to mind, and he took out a small unmarked book from his blazer pocket, opened it to a specific page somewhere in the middle. “Ah,” he said. “Interesting.” He pointed to a line written on the page. I tried to lean over and see but in that moment, there came a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew, Pembry was gone."	0.05			2018-10-26T04:00:03.801Z	0.24495605686952773	0.93	63926

We all have our preferences when it comes to luggage. Some of us prefer the hard-sided rolling bag. We like that what we see is what we get, that its shape remains steadfast always. We find comfort in knowing that our things will be safe inside. Perhaps we go on a vacation and buy a commemorative glass; with our hard-sided luggage we can be sure that it will be safe, as long as you don’t pack it too loosely. You don’t have to worry about some other bag in the cargo crushing it.
Others of us prefer the duffel. It’s casual but also classic. It can go down the street to the gym, or across the world to Shanghai. If you don’t have much to pack, it’ll take up less space. You can pack lightly or overpack a little bit. Its soft sides are forgiving. Also: they’re malleable. Pack one full of clothes, and you can squeeze it almost anywhere. It’s like a firmer pillow.
And yet…
There are times when we wish our hard-sided luggage had just a little bit more give to fit in the tight space behind the passenger seat of a fully packed car. And there are times when we’d like trust our duffel to hold its shape just a little bit more. For example, when we travel to wine country in Oregon, we want to bring back a bottle of wine, not a bag full of wet wine-scented clothing and some decorative shards of glass.
In other words: when it comes to bag-style our preference is not as firm as we might think. And facing this knowledge, it quickly becomes clear that the options aren’t hard-sided or duffel. They’re:

We can refuse to choose. We can eschew bags altogether. We can wear all of the clothes we want to bring on a given trip, layered over each other. The top layer can be pair of cargo pants and a hoodie with a big pouch. In the pockets: our toiletries, our travel knickknacks, our phones, etc.

Or…

We can choose both. As in, we can buy one of each: a U.S. Polo hard-sided bag, and a U.S. Polo rolling duffel. If we’re going for ten days at the vase expo, we can bring the hard-sided luggage. If we’re driving across the country and want something that’s easy to roll in and out of motels every night, we can take the duffel. But with both, we always have what you need.

Okay, fine. This is manipulative. If you really want to buy just one or the other, that’s fine too… But know this: some day, you might regret that choice–some day, you might need those hard sides or that soft top–and when that day comes, we won’t be able to help you.

There’s a double-standard here. If you buy a shirt that’s slimming and shave every day because your facial hair comes in patchy or comb your hair a certain way that looks best with your face-shape, it wouldn’t be considered inauthentic. If anything, it’s the opposite. It shows an intelligence, an understanding of what you have and what works best. Because none of those things are harmful or uncomfortable or particularly time-consuming. They’re just simple steps you take to look your best.
On the other hand, if you try to slow the thinning of your hair–or at least slow the appearance of your hair thinning–that’s considered inauthentic. It’s mocked. Men are told that going bald is embarrassing, but also that covering up baldness is embarrassing. Because it exhibits some denial of reality, a fight against what nature has intended for you.
To which, we reply: Yeah, no shit! And there’s nothing wrong with that!
Maybe at some point, we can all wear ponchos, choosing between three or four each morning based solely on thickness of material. Those who are not going bald will stop cutting their hair, and those who are going bald will allow their hair to recede without ridicule. We will all stop showering, and we will all stop brushing our teeth, and we will cease complaining about the natural odors of our bodies and breath. And if some lose their teeth because theirs are weak, they will drink only nutritional juice of a greenish-brown color, and no one will judge them for it.
Until then, we just gotta do what we gotta do to look whatever way feels best. And if that’s using a hair fiber and locking spray, so be it.
(And P.S., yes: given that we have out spoken against pseudo-science in the past, we did give a healthy amount of side-eye to the marketing copy that claims, “negatively charged Moroccan cotton fibers adhere to positively charged individual strands of natural human hair at the root for a noticeably fuller look.” But here’s the thing: there’s a difference in how harmful it is to say some fibers make your head look nice versus claiming an aligned chakra is the best arthritis medicine, so we’ll let it slide.)"	0.05			2018-10-23T04:00:01.475Z	0.3256555514094781	0.94	62467			0.10346348247905289

“No,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s little knights, I’m sure,” the exorcist said. “They ride in upon plastic horses and jab you with their surprisingly sharp lances.”
“It’s not them either,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s certainly dolls and stuffed toys,” the exorcist proclaimed. “Raggedy Annes and Andys, sock monkeys, and teddy bears, all singing ironic songs of friendship while stalking your every move, each brandishing pencils sharpened into shivs.”
“Actually,” the toy seller said, “it’s fidget spinners.”
“Wait, what? Fidget spinners? Seriously?”
“I’m afraid it’s very serious,” the toy seller said. “They just won’t stop… spinning.”
“That’s it,” the exorcist said. “They’re just spinning? Like fidget spinners do? But on their own?”
“Exactly! And I have work to do! But I can’t anything done! Because I’m so distracted by their infernal noises! Some of them even glow!”
The exorcist nodded. “I understand. They glow brightly with the spirits of the dead.”
“Nope,” the toy seller said. “They’re just the LED kind. And they don’t all glow very brightly. They’re pretty hit-or-miss, to be honest. A lot of them are fine, but the lights on some are dim, or out entirely. That’s why we’re selling them for cheaper than the non-LED ones.”
“Okay,” the exorcist said. “I think I know what to do. But I’ll need absolute privacy while I carry out the… um… exorcism. And I’m sorry to say, I’ll need to take the fidget spinners with me. To… ensure they don’t get possessed again or whatever.”
The toy seller did not object. In fact, he hugged him and thanked him with tears and his eyes. The exorcist assured him it would all be okay.

Welcome to everyone’s favorite day: Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, wherein we offer a new shirt or whatever every Sunday until, eventually, we get lazy or forget and it ends! Today’s shirt requires a little more explanation than the others. Basically, it’s the Casemates launch shirt, on royal blue… BUT you get a choice: the original sketchy version of the logo (and that’s sketchy as in sketch-like; not like, “it can’t be trusted”) or a new exciting more geometric-looking logo!
That leaves you with four potential purchase choices:
You Purchase The Classic Design
This the option for people who respect tradition. You want a shirt you can wear each night when you return to your victorian home and settle into your bergère chair to re-read Don Quixote. What’s that playing in the background? Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16, of course. And what’s that you’re drinking? Maybe a glass of 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir, or maybe a Boulevardier cocktail that you’ve been antiquing for a few days in a mason jar in the fridge. It all goes just smashingly with your new (or should we say old?) Casemates shirt!
You Purchase The New Design
Here, we have the modern choice. You’ll look right at home wearing this when you pull your electric car into the driveway of your house, a recent construction comprised, it appears, of only the most jagged of edges. Inside, you’ll ask your digital assistant to play the latest release from your favorite musician, a masked individual from a country far away who makes electronic music that is one step removed from the dial-up modem noise. Then you’ll settle in to read a collection of experimental prose poetry while sitting on a piece of brutalist furniture that might be a couch but also might be an end table; you can’t remember. What you are sure of: how comfortable you feel in your exciting new Casemates shirt!
You Purchase Both
This one goes out to all those who toe the line between classic and modern. You like mid-century modern furniture. You listen to blue-grass covers of new wave songs and new wave covers of blue-grass songs. In short, you appreciate all things: from the old and traditional to the new and innovative. If we may be so bold: this is definitely the best choice.
You Purchase Neither
This choice, on the other hand… well, it’s not really a choice at all. It’s the absence of one. You’ve essentially chosen not to choose. To put it bluntly, you are empty. You see stories about rescue dogs on Facebook and feel nothing. you stand directly in front of the elevator doors waiting for them to open, not because you’re in a rush, not because you think you’re better than other people, but because you haven’t thought at all. Often, you feel as though you’ve forgotten something. Your phone? No. It’s in your pocket. Your wallet? No. That’s there too. Your keys? No again. Really, you have forgotten nothing; instead, what you’re experiencing is the sensation of your being crying out to fill the hole where a soul should be.

Or maybe they could’ve called it a photo drone or a video drone, because it does have a camera that can take 1.3MP pictures and 720p videos. After all, drones are often used for photos or videos. My pretty basic wedding package featured a video done with a drone. Remember that shot at the end of 10 Things I Hate About You, of the band playing on the top of building while the credits rolled?

Still, what annoys me isn’t the how clear it is that this product was definitely named by some old dude thinking he’d discovered a new way to “reach the youth.” It had to be, by the way, because, say what you will about millennials, they at least know what a selfie is, and a photo that you need a drone’s angle to capture is not a selfie; it’s a photo with you in it. There’s a difference.
What annoys me is how reductive it is. It’s a dumb marketing 101. It thinks it’s carved out some entirely new lane in the drone game by catering to the selfie-obsessed among us, without taking into account the large number of people that it would turn off. Like, there are probably folks who arrived at the site today, read the product name, and said, “oh, no way,” and navigated away without reading another word. Or even if they did get further, they might still be thinking, It could be cool… but cool enough to risk my friends seeing a box that says “Selfie Drone” on it in the week before the recycling gets picked up?

Dear iRobot,
You’ve done what many companies aspire to do, but few actually achieve. In this stratosphere of success, your company is elite: Xerox, Kleenex, Ping Pong. Your product’s name–the Roomba–is now synonymous with (or maybe even supersedes) the “robot vacuum cleaner.” Congratulations.
And many of us here at Meh have been along for the ride since nearly day one. Yet, there’s something that’s frustrated us over the years: every time we sell a Roomba, we realize the model is slightly different than the previous one, despite looking almost exactly the same. We then dive into hours of research, hoping to solve the mystery of what’s so different in order to help our customers make an informed purchasing decision–only to find, in the end,  something trivial, like the canister capacity being one tenth of a percent larger than before.
What we’re saying here, iRobot, is: help us. Or, help us help you. Why not give every  new Roomba a feature that really STANDS OUT, so that they can be easily differentiated?
For example:


You could make one that says “sorry” whenever it bumps into a wall. An another that cries out in pain whenever it bumps into a wall. And another that recites a poem by Robert Frost in a Mike Tyson accent whenever it bumps into a wall.


Or a model that kisses your ankles when it goes by so that you know it loves you.


How about a Roomba that can take all the crumbs from the kitchen floor and forms them into new snacks for you to serve at your next party?


Maybe one Roomba could feature “pie warmth and texture.” And then the ""Plus ""version of that model could also feature “pie flavor.” And it could just be a pie.


Or what about a Roomba that just came with one completely functional human finger? Is that too much to ask?


Look, iRobot: the sensors, the 3-Stage Cleaning System, the ability to automatically adjust to any floor and navigate around furniture–that stuff is cool and all, but it’s also what we expect. Why not give people something a bit more unique? It would certainly be great for us. And if it’s great for us, isn’t it great for you too?
Just something to think about.

Twelve-year-olds Arthur and Lisa, having split up to cover more of the town, reconvened at the tree house to compare their trick-or-treat bounties. They’d both dressed as zombies, but even through all the gory face paint, their disappointment was clear.
“Another lame Halloween,” Arthur said. “It’s like, what’s wrong with giving out candy? Everyone around here tries to get too creative. I got the worst stuff.”
“You got the worst? Wait until you see what I’ve got,” Lisa said.
They sat down and began removing items from their respective glowing Pop Lights bags.
“Look at this,” Arthur said. “Someone gave me one Triscuit!”
“If you want something to dip it in, I’ve got a bunch of ketchup packets here from an old lady,” Lisa said. “Hey, what’s that sloshing noise?”
“Loose soup,” Arthur said. “The guy just ladled it into my bag.”
Lisa leaned over and looked. “Are those malt balls floating in it?”
“Nope. Meatballs. It’s Italian wedding.”
“At least you can eat that,” Lisa said. “I don’t know what to do with these ticket stubs from a 1992 Celine Dion concert.”
Arthur put on a pair of eyeglasses. “Let me see them.”
Lisa handed the stubs over. “I didn’t know you wore glasses.”
“I don’t,” Arthur said. “Someone on Fourth was handing these out.”
“New?”
“Gently used,” Arthur said.
“Maybe I could use them to read this.” Lisa pulled out a stack of papers from her glowing Halloween bag. “Guy on twelfth was giving out copies of his unfinished novel. And I need to have critiques back to him in two weeks.”
“How is it?”
“It’s okay. There are some point of telling issues. Like, if you’re going to use a retrospective POV, the narrator can’t be surprised by the events as they unfold. Also, some of the fantastical elements frustrate me. I keep thinking: what are the rules of this world?”
“Huh,” Arthur said. “I wouldn’t be much help. I’m a journalist, not a novelist. Or at least I am now that a woman on Church Street gave me this.” He handed a diploma over to Lisa.
“Wow, a journalism degree! From George Washington University! They could be really useful,” Lisa said, “for mopping up the soup!”
“Hey, good idea,” Arthur said.
“I have no idea what to do with this.” Lisa held a sheet of paper.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“An NDA,” Lisa said.
“For what?”
“I can’t tell you.”
The two of them fell silent for a moment.
“You want one of these I Trick-or-Treated 2018 stickers?” Arthur offered.
Lisa took one. “Thanks. You want any of these Spirit Airline points I got over on Main?”
“Sure. How about some opportunities to build real wealth and passive income through direct marketing? Someone on Grand was handing those out.”
“Couldn’t hurt,” Lisa said.
“That’s it for me,” Arthur said. “And to think: I thought my parents were the lame ones for handing out some fidget spinners they bought online. What a bust!”
“Actually, maybe it wasn’t a total bust. A family on Breezy Lane did give me this.” Lisa took it out and set it down between them.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“I think it’s another, smaller, Halloween.” Lisa pointed at something swirling. “See, look.”

Probably, we should lie. We should say that this is practical. We should say something like: you can garden from inside! We should claim something about how, with the success of HBO’s Sharp Objects, wealthy families have a renewed interest in dollhouses, and some of them are even hiring full construction crews to break ground and build them; get the heavy duty equipment your crew needs to beat out the other bidders!
But we won’t. Instead, we’ll look both ways, we’ll lean forward, we’ll gesture for your to lean forward too, and then we’ll whisper into your ear…
We’re selling this so you can give it as a gift.
We’re cautious to admit this because you know how people get. The holiday season is filled with camaraderie, but few forms are as cathartic as uniting against its annual encroachment. They’ve got the decorations up and it’s not even December, you’ll say to a stranger in the coffee shop. Are they playing “Jingle Bells”? Before Thanksgiving? someone will say in the checkout line at the grocery store. You’ll shake your head when Santa’s village appears in the mall before the first significant snowfall, or when you see a flyer informing you that Black Friday sales somehow start on Tuesday this year.
And here we are, making our first offering of the gift-giving season weeks before Halloween! What gall, you think. What nerve. But friends: hear us out. By offering this R/C Excavator today, we’re not trying to get a jump on anyone… but ourselves.
Though we don’t always act like it, at the end of the day, we’re a store. The holiday season should be our time to shine. And yet, to really “kill it” during the holidays, you need to be sure of yourself. You need to be organized, to know when things will ship and how long they will take to get to where they’re going. You need to build a balanced approached; you can’t just sell a bunch of toys or a bunch of electronics or a bunch of socks. You need to offer all three at different times based on sales trends from previous years.
But let’s be real here, Meh doesn’t exactly stand for “Meticulous, engaged, and hardworking.” It stands for… ummm… we don’t know. It was hard enough to come up with “Meticulous, engaged, and hardworking,” and honestly, now we could use a nap.

Two-for-Tuesday? Where’s the ambition in that? Yes, it sounds nice. But we can’t let alliteration lower our standards. So today, it’s four-for-Tuesday or twenty-four-for-Tuesday (which, I guess is technically alliterative).
That’s right, a choice between four or twenty-four. You know that means, it’s…
ORDER/HOARDER!!!
In these semi-regular sales, we provide two options: one a fair number of things for a good price; the other is an unfair number of things for a GREAT price. So, without further ado, let’s get started.
Today’s product is…
FLEECE BLANKETS!
I don’t know about where you all live, but here, the weather has taken a dark turn. It even snowed yesterday! Which means: it’s time to make a nice cup of tea or cocoa and bundle up under a fleece blanket on the couch with one to twelve dogs and/or cats for the next five months.
THE MATH
The four-pack will run you $14. That’s $3.50 per blanket. Not bad, right? But wait! The twenty-four pack goes for $60. That’s $2.50 per blanket. But wait even more! If the first four cost $14, that means the last twenty cost just $46, which is $2.30 per blanket! Does it make sense to break it down like that? Probably not! But that’s how we do it here on Order/Hoarder days!
WHAT TO DO WITH FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
With four fleece blankets, you can put one on the couch, one on recliner, keep one in the office, and still have a backup to rotate in when one is being washed. Or, store them all in a closet and break them out for a late fall bonfire.
WHAT TO DO WITH TWENTY-FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
So! Much! For example:


You could give them out as gifts to twenty-four of your favorite people!


Or, if you don’t have twenty-four favorite people, give them as gifts to twelve of your favorite people! (You can use the remaining twelve fleece blankets as wrapping paper for the other twelve fleece blankets!)


Send one to each venue on your favorite band’s 24-stop winter tour to show you’re a true fan!


Or, give one to all but four members of the twenty-eight piece Swedish indie pop group, I’m From Barcelona, in case they have to play any cold weather outdoor festivals! If they complain about not everyone getting a blanket, just tell them you’re not the idiot who decided to start a twenty-eight person band!


Use them to build a winter-ready tent in the bank yard! Actually, hell, you’ve got 24 fleece blankets! Build a winter-ready tent mansion!


Interior decorators will tell you that the right lighting can give rooms a soft, warm feeling; we say, why stop at lights? Why not take that “soft, warm feeling” over the top by wallpapering your house with fleece blankets?


See? Maybe twenty-four fleece blankets isn’t so impractical after all.
So, what’s it going to be: are you going to place a boring old order, or are you going to take the exciting first steps to becoming a fleece blanket hoarder?"	0.05			2018-10-16T04:00:03.596Z	0.3410857897640822	0.93	63281

Let’s start off general and work our way into more specifics. Every laptop manufacturer calls their product something different, but a Chromebook isn’t just a cool name. It’s actually a different kind of computer. Laptop Magazine sums it up nicely:

Instead of Windows 10 or macOS, Chromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. These machines are designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with most applications and documents living in the cloud.

In other words, if you live in a cabin somewhere in the mountains, and you have to hike and ski many miles back to civilization to grab a solitary bar of wi-fi, this might not be your best bet. Nor would it be a good option if you’re looking for a machine that can support your career cutting movie trailers and playing the latest computer games. These things are pretty sparse, in terms of power.
But for the rest of us, who pretty much never stray far from the router and who mostly use our computers for checking email, keeping track of things, writing, and organizing: a Chromebook is actually a pretty great, pretty cheap option.
And this one is actually both of those things: we’re selling it for just under $150, and on Amazon it has four stars on over 1,000 reviews.
Yes, if you want to be cynical, you could say: but wait, Meh, this thing came back out who-knows-when, and many of those reviews were written a while ago. And that’s true. BUT 1) there were still five star reviews coming in as recently as August of 2018; and 2) never underestimate the online reviewer. Like, these people self-identify as arbiters of all that is good (and not good) to buy; do you really think they wouldn’t rush to update their review the minute anything goes wrong?
Besides, let’s be totally honest: as much as we like to talk about the forward march of tech, most of us are still using our computers for the exact same things as we did five years ago. New apps come and go, but we’ll always need to make spreadsheets and type up documents and check our email.
Who knows? Maybe it’s a blessing it’s a little older: it might mean it was unaffected by the Gmail redesign. That’d be worth the price alone, if you ask us!"	0.05			2018-10-15T04:00:05.520Z	0.2839675274780344	0.93	64996

Mr. Khool was the coolest teacher at Meh High. He taught an elective called The Mathematics of Skating, a class he only managed to get approved after bringing the principal to a skate park and catching phat air while explaining how each side of a halfpipe was essentially a graph of exponential growth. Now, he was on his way to teach his first session of it when, rounding a corner, he heard stifled sobs.
Narf, hunched next to the water fountain, tried to straighten up when he saw Mr. Khool approaching. “Oh, hey, Mr. Khool. I was just… uh… making sure the fountains weren’t leaking.”
“Sounds like the only thing leaking are your eyes, l’il guy,” said Mr. Khool, crouching next to him. “You want to talk about it?”
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Narf said. “It’s just… well… I feel like when all the other kids ask for stuff, they get it right away. Toothbrushes. Jerky. Fidget spinners. But I’ve been asking for the same thing for years, and nobody takes me seriously.”
“I know what you’re going through,” Mr. Khool said.
“You do?”
“Sure! Being a cool guy is great, but sometimes it’s hard to get people to take me seriously. They think it’s all kick flips and cliff jumps, when really that’s only like 60 to 70 percent of what I do. There’s also a lot of hard work that nobody gives me credit for. But you know what? Whenever I start to feel like maybe it’s time to trade my longboard in for a Prius, I remind myself: there’s a reason progress and persistence both start with p. A friend of mine told me that once. His name was Tony Hawke.”
Narf’s eyes went wide. “Tony Hawk the skateboarder?”
“No,” Mr. Khool said. “This is Hawke with an e. He was Ethan Hawke’s second cousin. We played in a band together in college. And actually he went by Anthony.”
“So do you just call him Tony Hawke so people think you’re talking about Tony Hawk?”
“It doesn’t matter why I do it,” Mr. Khool said. “The point is, it’s a decision I made to call him Tony. And we all have decisions to make in this life. So, are you going to give up, or are you going to decide to keep chasing your dreams?”
Narf stood up. “You’re right! It doesn’t matter that it’s taken this long! I can’t give up now, not for anything!”
“That’s right! So, what is it that you’ve been asking for?”
“A cat shirt,” Narf said.
“Wait, seriously?” Mr. Khool said, getting to his feet. “But you’re Narf. You’re wearing a cat shirt right now. And you wore one yesterday. And the day before that. And actually every other day too. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the same cat shirt twice, now that I think about it.”
Narf slung his backpack over his shoulder. “Sorry, Mr. Khool. I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve gotta get to chem. Thanks again! You really said exactly what I needed to hear!”
“That’s great,” Mr. Khool said. “Although, maybe we need some other designs?”
But Narf was already off and running to his next class.

Douglas, We’re glad you’re here. We can see you’re confused, but don’t worry: all will be explained. You see, when LeAnn said to come home so you two could “take a scenic flight over a pristine lake” together, she was lying. This is an intervention. We, your friends and family–we’re all worried about you, Douglas.
It all began when you bought that Odyssey Stellar NX Drone. You said it was a way to bond with your son. But you didn’t let Trevor use it much, did you, Douglas? Still, it was a fun hobby for you. You liked that it came with a VR headset, so you could see from the drone’s POV. You would fly it, recharge it, fly it, recharge it, all day.
Only after a few months did we start to see the warning signs. You walked into furniture, cursing your legs. You started standing on the dining table to watch television. You called this “a more natural prospective.”
Then there was the mini drone that came with your purchase of the original drone. You started calling it ‘l’il guy,’ then ‘son,’ then finally you named it. It would’ve seemed cute, if you didn’t choose, ‘Trevor,’ the same name as your real son.
Yes, Douglas, that’s right: only one of them is your real son. Because you are not a drone, Douglas! You are a man! You might spend days coming out of drone-prospective for only as long as it takes your Odyssey to charge. You might spend these times with your eyes closed tight, whispering, “it’s a dream, it’s just a dream,” so as not to face the fact that you are a human being, and as such, you are bound by gravity to remain on the ground.
But it’s not healthy, Douglas! You have a family! You have a job! You have obligations! You can’t just ignore them because you have “a new life in the sky” now. It can be a fun hobby, but you’ll never really be a drone, Douglas. You need to start seeing that. And moreover, you need to apologize to all of us for what you’ve put us through.

User @alacrity wants one thing and one thing only: a margarita.
When we sold a Copper Cookware set, they wrote:

well, I guess I could serve margaritas in these…

On a two-pack of posture trainers:

it has to be said: these make really shitty margaritas.

For a 2-pack of cast aluminum skillets:

well, I guess I could drink a margarita out of em… but there’s still the salted rim thing.

A coffee maker:

this will make very hot margaritas.

Earrings:

these are absolutely useless for margaritas.

You might notice that these are not all sales from the last few months. No, @alacrity has lived with desire for years. But that will change today. Because today we are selling a Cuisinart Waring Pro Blade Blender.
And yet the story does not end here. What we want to know is: how does @alacrity feel about this?
Will they arrive at the site today relieved? Will they cry aloud, “For many years I have wished for nothing more than a sweet lime-rich tequila cocktail. And at long last, the great Meh has delivered to me a device that shall itself deliver me to my own personal paradise. Thank you, Meh! Thank you so much!”?
Or will they feel some resentment? Will they realize, all too late, that the real margarita was the friends they made along the way? Or, to put it differently: is there any margarita that’s as sweet on the lips as camaraderie is to the heart?
And yet, there remains a fact we have not reconciled: uhh, like, hello? We’ve sold blenders before!
So perhaps we’re misreading @alacrity. Perhaps, they do not hope for their own margaritas at all. Perhaps they seek only to be a sort of margarita-specific town-crier, to stand in the virtual park at the center of Meh and warn all those around them about the dangers of attempting margaritas in products not optimized for margaritas.
And then of course, there is the final possibility: maybe @alacrity prefers margaritas on the rocks.
So what is it? Only time will tell. And by time, we mean: hopefully @alacrity in the forums."	0.05			2018-10-12T04:00:20.860Z	0.34750686103289724	0.94	59130

Watches? I never wear watches. Why would I wear a watch in the age of cellphones? That’s what I say. Because I believe in efficiency. It guides my every waking move, from the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the time I lay down to sleep at night. (That’s the alarm on my phone, by the way. Why have an alarm clock when you have a cell phone?)
But it’s one thing to say you believe in efficiency, and it’s a whole other thing to live by it. I know because I do. To prove it, I’ll run through my average morning:
First thing’s first, I make breakfast. It’s the same every day: spaghetti and meatballs. I have it for lunch too. And dinner. Food is food, isn’t it? Why should I have different foods for different meals?
When I’m done eating, I floss and brush my teeth, then spit into the drain in my shower. Because why have a sink when you have a shower? Is not a shower a human-height sink? Think about that for a second. Anyway, when I’m done brushing my teeth, I wash my hands with shampoo. Soap-products are soap-products, after all! Then I shave, checking my reflection in the mirror–by which I mean, my phone, on selfie mode.
A little bit of leisure time is part of being efficient too. So, before heading out the door to work, I take twenty minutes to relax. I might watch a show (on my phone) or read a book (on my phone). But soon enough it’s time to check the weather (on my phone). To confirm the app, I look out the window–the single window I have in my whole house. Why do I need to see out my house from so many different sides? Outside is outside, no matter what way you’re looking at it. One window is plenty.
Using this information, I decide what I’m going to wear: pants or shorts. I should elaborate; it’s the one garment, but it’s got a zipper so I can unzip them at the knee when it gets warm. It’s the same pair I wear every day, because again, for me it’s all about efficiency. Not everyone is a fan of this. My sister, for example, once said she actually hated my zip-on pant-shorts. She said I should switch things up by wearing something else sometimes. She said that by wearing them I was ruining her wedding. Can you believe that?
She hasn’t spoken to me since then, but I don’t mind. I still have another sister, and honestly, at the time, I was in the middle of a painful decision of which sister I would keep. Two sisters? Are you crazy? Who needs all that in your life?
Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh, right: these watches. Yep, don’t need them. Although, they would go nicely with the one sweatshirt always I wear, especially on days when it’s hot enough that I have to roll up the sleeves. And if you’re wondering why I don’t just take it off, it’s simple: I’m not wearing anything underneath. Wearing a shirt under what is essentially another shirt? That’s nuts!"	0.06			2018-10-11T04:00:06.347Z	0.3548942995103143	0.93	61867

Imagine for a moment you’re a secret agent. You’ve been called upon to infiltrate a very important party held by a tycoon with designs to take over the world. You need to take a video of the party, so key attendees can be identified, and hopefully sneak into the study where you’re told the plans for the doomsday device are kept. For this mission, you’ll be provided with a PogoCam. It’s smaller than a tube of lip balm, attaches magnetically to your favorite pair of glasses, and shoots 5 megapixel photos and 720p HD videos. You just need to go to Q to collect it.
FYI: in this imagined scenario, Q refers to the dumpster behind the Qwikmart convenience store down the block, not the genius gadgeteer from the movies. Because, boy oh boy, would that guy steer clear of this thing.
In fact, over on Amazon the PogoCam only has 2.5 stars. That’s some real ruh-roh territory, especially given most products fall into a 3 star rating just by being delivered. People who bought it without the Pogotrack sunglasses offered here griped about the safety loop required when using your own pair.  Others complain about the picture quality or that it only takes 30-second video clips.  One user goes even further: “while I have little proof,” LE says, “[I] believe PogoCam has been the cause of much of the world’s turmoil lately.”
Not great!
But here’s the thing: since it’s come out and been revealed to be of less than desirable quality, the PogoCam’s price has tanked. In fact, I’m told that at one point is retailed for as high as $150. That’s nuts. But even with all those price drops, it’s still just shy of 50 on the 'zon.
We’re selling it for $24. For that price, it can just be a fun little gimmicky impulse buy. Wear it once or twice and you’ve pretty much justified the purchase. If you get it to work better than a bunch of Amazon reviewers and find some real use for it, awesome! If not, at least you got some sweet magnetic sunglasses out of the deal.

There were only two of them in the conference room, but when the engineer placed the SmartStand prototype on the table, his hands still shook with anxiety, as if he were making a presentation to the entire company. In a way, he was. Across the table sat the founder and CEO.
“Looks simple.”
“Just as you asked, sir,” the engineer said.
“So let’s talk features,” said the CEO. “It can hold your tablet or phone while you’re cooking, so that the recipe is easy to read?”
“Yes, sir,” said the engineer.
“And it tracks the ingredients used, placing orders based on what’s running low in your cabinet and refrigerator?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it intuit how romantic a given meal seems, and adjust the room’s lighting accordingly?”
“No, sir.”
“Does it feature an olfactory sensor that reads the smell of the meal and gives spicing advice?”
“No, sir.”
“Let’s talk about travel use: on an airplane, it can hold up your phone or tablet making it easier to watch a show or movie?”
“Yes, sir.”
“And it can place drink orders with the flight attendant, based upon the mood of said show or movie?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it message the gate attendants of your connecting flight, informing them when delays get in the way of your lunch or dinner plans, so they know to have a torta from Frontera waiting for you?”
“No, sir.”
“Tell me that it can at least read the forecast for your destination and place orders for weather-appropriate pants.”
“It can’t, sir.”
The CEO stared for a long time at the prototype. “So, it’s not ‘smart’ at all?”
“Well, sir,” the engineer said, “I like to think of it like this: by adding a number of attention-grabbing but ultimately unnecessary and overcomplicated ‘smart’ features, we’d only introduce the possibility for bugs and glitches. Not to mention we would have to put out different models for different phones and tablets. So, despite how it may seem, this is a ‘smart’ product, in that simplicity is smart, because it leads to ease of use and universal compatibility.”
The CEO pounded his fist on the table. “I like that! I like that a lot! Not smart is actually smart! That’s great! That’s gonna help me a lot, not just at work, but also in my personal life!”
“Actually, sir, what I said was simplicity is–”

We’re entering the time of year when everything freezes and dies and allergies are replaced by a sense of tired dryness. For some of you, this might be a relief. And yet, consider these two things: first, said dryness does nothing to dry up non-seasonal allergies, like those related to pets; and second, spring will be back sooner than you think with its pollen-thick air. And just like the smart shopper buys next year’s wrapping paper the day after Christmas when it’s marked down to nothing, so too does he or she purchase an allergen-optimized vacuum just as allergy season winds down.
And boy oh boy, does this thing suck up allergies. In fact, it “captures and traps 99.9% of dust and allergens down to 1 micron.” As a non-allergy-sufferer myself, I don’t know exactly what that means. I can tell you that, given the the word “micron” is pretty much just “micro” with an n, it sounds pretty small.
What I actually CANNOT understand is what the fuck “MultiFLEX Technology” is. I know that it “provides flexible reach for under furniture and freestanding, compact storage.” But what does that mean, exactly? Digging a little deeper, I found that the “MultiFLEX wand bends so you don’t have to, reaching under low lying furniture with ease.” So, apparently, it’s a kind of semi-flexible wand? That’s it? Seriously?
But friends, I’m not mad. No, not at all. In fact, I think it’s smart. Genius even! Every feature of every product, regardless of how mundane, should get the marketing-speak treatment. For example:

Yes, on one level, the design is simple: it’s the Meh face, or should we say, the many (meh-ny) Meh faces you see when you come to our site. It’s a button. You press it. You keep a streak going, if you want. Or else you don’t; you reserve the Meh button only to show your nonplussedness. It’s something that makes our site special, a little inside joke among you, the customer, and us.
But, on another level, the design means so much more. It’s a tribute. To us. And all we’ve done for the world of commerce. Before we came along, all was excitement, and much of it was false. Companies didn’t know that it was fine enough to be, well, fine enough. Everything had to be glorious and exuberant. But then we showed up, and we taught people that it doesn’t always have to be that way. You don’t have to worry about moving the proverbial needle. You don’t need to dial it up to a ten. You can hang out at a five if you want.

It’s pretty simple, except for one wrinkle, which is that you get to choose what capacity power bank you want: 4200, 6000, or 9000 mAh. Now, most modern phones can be fully charged with between 2000 and 3000 mAh, which means even the smallest power bank we’re offering can charge your phone somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times. By that standard, you could get 2.5 to 3 full charges with a 6000 mAh power bank, and 4.5 to 5 with the 9,000.
But look, we’re not going to spend the next few hundred words talking math. It’s too abstract. The most helpful thing to do would be to provide brief profiles for who might require each power capacity, so that you identify yourself among them. Here goes:

You’ve got a full day ahead of you, enacting archaic rituals and making shady transactions in a number of parks in and around Cincinnati. And let’s just say the Corrigans didn’t factor in any time for you to stop and juice up your phone.

You find that you have an intense desire to work out. You go running and clock 18 miles easily. The next day you go further. And further after that. Soon you’re running up mountains just to get your heart rate going. You’ve made partner at the firm, which is crazy because you don’t remember becoming a lawyer. The paychecks are amazing.

Each year, representatives from all 50 European countries gather for the EuroSock Summit to discuss potential changes to the sock’s age-old design. Here is a summary of year’s Summit, which took place in Luxembourg in a chamber deep inside the Grand Ducal Palace:


The representative from Sweden proposed changing the design, so that the sock appeared strangely both modern yet antiquated, like a torture device, but also attractive and entirely comfortable. Motion failed to pass by a vote of 11 to 39.


The representative from Italy proposed making the next EuroSock as soft as the richest pillowy ball of burrata, as delicate to touch as the most sumptuous pluck-able leaves of basil, and yet as firm as tagliatelle cooked to a perfect al dente. Also: more garlic. Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 19 to 31.


The representative from France proposed making the sock from a distinct material that would grow delightfully crusty over night, so to it could be enjoyed the next day. There was some confusion over this, but eventually the representative from France admitted she was simply hungry, having been disappointed in her hotel’s bread options that morning at breakfast. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Norway proposed making the sock seven times thicker. When someone suggested he have multiple pairs of socks–some for summer, others for winter–he smiled and nodded, saying, “Yes, exactly! These would be for summer!” Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 3 to 47.


The representative from Ireland proposed making the socks out of a darker fabric, one “as pitch black as a Guinness.” The representative from Belgium chimed in to add that the fabric should be strong, “not unlike a delicious quadrupel.” The German representative also leaned forward to propose adding a pinch of sea salt, “one of the key ingredients in a traditional gose.” When they all three broke down laughing it became clear that they’d partaken in a few of the aforementioned beverages during the break for lunch.

When I first saw that we were selling an air fryer, I was torn.
On the one hand, Wirecutter pretty emphatically stated that they don’t recommend these things for how expensive they are. If you’re not familiar with Wirecutter, they’re basically one of the best and most straightforward resources for when you’re buying kitchen appliances, electronics, and just about everything in between. They do a lot of research and provide simple, easy-to-understand articles replete with concrete purchasing recommendations. So, their opinion carries a lot of weight.
On the other hand, my dad has an air fryer and he likes it.
Two venerable sources. Two contradictory opinions. I didn’t know who to trust. So I began to dig deeper. Here’s what I found:


While working on his Wirecutter article, Michael Sullivan conducted more than 35 hours worth of air fryer tests. In the end, he was so unimpressed with them that he recommended buying a simple convection toaster oven to get a better bang for your buck.


Back when I was in high school, my dad used to change my car’s oil. Not just check it, mind you, but perform a full-blown change. He had a little pit in the garage, so you could pull your car right in and he’d take care of it every 3000 miles.


Given those two facts, I came to the following conclusion: it was possible that my dad had also used his air fryer for 35 total hours, yet it was very unlikely that Michael Sullivan had ever changed the oil in my car when I was in high school. This seemed like a pretty clear “checkmate” situation. But then I remembered that an air fryer’s greatest selling point is its oil-free frying. Thus, it only seemed fair that all oil-based arguments need be discarded. I found myself right back at square one.
Then it hit me: my dad is a Meh customer. He likely bought his air fryer right here on this very site. Meanwhile, Wirecutter suggests a model that retails at about $250, which is FIVE TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS ONE. Furthermore, they never say they’re outright bad; they just say they aren’t worth the money. Which makes sense: my dad would likely not be the satisfied air-frying customer he is today had he been required to fork over more than 200 bucks.
Therefore, Wirecutter, I know we’ve suggested this before, but if you’re reading this, consider an addendum to your initial verdict of “Not recommended”: something like, “unless it’s selling on Meh for almost a fifth of the cost, in which case, go to town.” I’d be happy to put you in touch with my dad if you need any more information."	0.05			2018-10-03T04:00:13.622Z	0.4058992852291472	0.92	65054		0.15524434813545068

In the grand scheme of things, I’m pretty smart about health stuff. No, not necessarily among other humans. I mean in the REAL grand scheme, as in: among all living creatures in the world. I sometimes eat too many donuts, or drink so much coffee that I give myself a headache. But I at least KNOW what I’ve done immediately after I’ve done it. And compared to my cats or my dog, I come out looking like a friggin’ genius!
For example, I won’t find my way into the trash and attempt to consume a giant wad of paper towels that were used to soak up frying oil, only to slink behind the couch and embarrassedly vomit it up. And if I found myself stuck in a bathroom, I would wait patiently until someone got home and ask them for some help. I would not, under any circumstances, try to EAT MY WAY OUT, causing enough damage so that both the door and the trim need to be replaced, and giving myself a pretty rough tummy ache along the way. Another point in my favor: I understand the utility of pills as well as the ease with which they can be taken. They don’t need to be hidden in cheese or loaded into a little plastic contraption to be shot deep into my throat in order to induce swallowing. I just take them!
And yet, even as I type these gloating words, I’m sitting in a rickety wooden chair, leaning awkwardly over my laptop. Unlike the damage of a few too many donuts or a bit too much coffee, I won’t feel the effects of my bad poor posture for many years. And yet, I know this, but I do nothing to correct it.
In a way, poor posture is like the human version of eating out of the garbage. We just can’t help it. Instead of taste-testing rotten meat or chewing on plastic bags, we hunch. And just as pets need help learning what they should and should not do, often for their own good, so do we.
That’s where this this Posture PT Confidence Corrector comes in. It can fit onto just about any chair–from office chairs to the driver’s seat of your car–and it improves posture, which in turn strengthens your core and reduces lower back and shoulder pain. Or, to put it differently, it’s not unlike a spray that makes bad posture smell like sour apples!
Okay, that’s going a little overboard with the pet metaphor thing. It’s not a spray. It’s a posture corrector. Sorry for the confusion. Now buy one, and straighten out your life. Got it?"	0.05			2018-10-02T04:00:03.835Z	0.31486252125742953	0.93	62431

Today’s sale leaves us conflicted. On the one hand, this would seem like an Order/Hoarder sale: you’re given options, some more reasonable than others. On the other, it’s not exactly the same as past Order/Hoarder sales we’ve offered. For example, there are more than two options. So, if you don’t mind, we thought we could work through this together, with a little Q&A:
How does the math break down?
This is a little more complicated than usual. You can get a 40 pack of basic fidget spinners for $14 ($0.35/spinner) or a 40 pack of LED fidget spinners for $16 ($0.40/spinner). But you could also get a 160 pack of both LED and basic fidget spinners (an 80 and 80 split) for $34. Which is about $0.21 per spinner… except, if you think about it: the first 40 basic spinners cost $14 and the first 40 LED spinners cost $16, which adds up to $30. So that’s a mere $4 for the last 80 fidget spinners, or a nickel per! CRAZY!
So then why wouldn’t this be an Order/Hoarder sale?
For three reasons:


As mentioned above, it’s not an either/or. There are three options.


40 fidget spinners will already have you well on your way to hoarding fidget spinners; but, more importantly…


These aren’t really for hoarding! We’re offering them now, because we want  to get them to you with plenty of time to spare before the end of the month. That way, you can offer them out to Trick Or Treaters on Halloween. That doesn’t sound very hoarderly at all, does it?


Why wouldn’t you just give candy away on Halloween like everyone else?
Because fidget spinners are fun and will last longer. Also, this site is run by someone from Saint Louis where some people give out jokes instead of chocolate, so it’s kind of on brand for us to eschew the national standard for Halloween practices.
Wait, back up: what even ARE fidget spinners?
They’re goofy little spinny toys with no real purpose other then to be fidgeted with.
That’s sorta dumb, isn’t it?
You might think so, but in a world where people try to sell peppermint-scented oil as an alternative to physical therapy, I find it refreshing that there’s a product out there that’s explicitly for useless goofings-off.

You might wear the shirt proudly at first: to work, or out to grab drinks with friends, or when you’re on vacation, or when you’re visiting family. The people around you might ask, “Who made that shirt?” And you might respond: “Meh.” But really, you’ll want to say: “Me. I made it. Or I made it possible.

On September 13th, user @djslack offered up a list of potential things we could sell, including “some kind of interesting jerky type product.” And so here we are selling delicious Wicked Cutz jerky!
Now, we need to make two things clear:
First, this is some pretty classy jerky. Therefore, the price tag isn’t going to be exactly in line with the Slim Jim that you buy on a whim as you check out at the grocery store, only to open it in your car and for the noxious smell to make you regret your decision, although not enough to stop you from eating it. Hypothetically speaking. Point is: this is good jerky and good jerky costs money.
Second, and more importantly: we need to make something EXCEEDINGLY clear. We saw @djslack’s suggestion and considered it, but the decision to sell the jerky ultimately came down to us and us alone. In fact, there’s a chance that we subconsciously were thinking about selling jerky and so @djslack didn’t exactly give us the idea as much as surface it.
What we’re saying is: we’re not necessarily in the business of outsourcing our product selection. As in, we don’t do requests. As in, don’t get used to this, okay? Because this is it. The party ends here.
We say this because ever since we sold some toothbrushes as a joke–that’s right, it was a joke! A joke ON YOU!–we know there have been rumblings on the forums about something you’d like us to sell. That’s how obstinate we are, people: we won’t even name the item. We won’t even write the word. Because we are unmovable.
We’re like a brick wall. People always tell us that. They say, “Talking to you all is like talking to a brick wall.” Which we take as a compliment concerning our strength. And also our attractiveness, given that brick is a very beautiful building material. In certain cases, at least. Maybe not in some of the suburban architecture of the mid-fifties. But then again, those homes have a certain nostalgic beauty in a way. There’s a pure American warmth to them, isn’t there?
What were we talking about? Right: how we’re not a bunch of pushovers, and you can’t boss us around and tell us what to sell!

Dearest Professor Alba,
First off, a hearty congratulations on winning the Henning Prize. Your self-adhering bow-tie is certainly a masterwork, and the award is absolutely deserved. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the ceremony. As I am sure you are aware, since my expulsion, you are my sole correspondent from the Meyer Institute of Alchemic Fashion. But my choice not to attend is not due to some fear of seeing my former classmates and teachers again–or, more accurately, of experiencing their fear as they witness me. No, I cannot attend because I have fallen ill, and I fear this may be the last letter I ever write.
Although, perhaps ‘fallen ill’ is a simplification, as the illness under which I suffer has no name.
The trouble began in my makeshift lab late one night. I was working on a new stitch technique, making minor tweaks to it here and there over the course of several weeks. It was going nowhere, and after one particularly long day toiling in the haberdashery (with no Meyer Certification, I am forced to do such menial labor), I came home so exhausted and angry that I decided to throw it all away in favor of something entirely new.
I am sure you will be disappointed to hear this. During my expulsion hearings, you were the strongest voice in my favor. When the administration said that I “endangered” all those around me with the “diabolical recklessness” of my work, you told them it was just a phase. But Professor Alba, it was not. And while I am not proud to admit that, I am also not exactly not proud either.
For that evening, in my lab, I created something amazing: a stitch unlike any other stitch; a stitch that seemed to take time into it, that seemed to steal tiny slivers of the universe’s fabric and convert them into pure style. It was a stitch that resembled a stitch in only an ethereal way, like a word in another language whose definition we can on some level understand but for which there is no direct translation. I sewed up some pairs of socks with the stitch; despite using bland monochrome fabrics, each pair came out patterned with a bold unpredictable design.
I learned all too late that it was taking something from me as well, that it was essentially draining my life energy, weaving it among each sock’s seams. I fashioned a lead coat to wear while working, but it was too late. The damage has been done. I write this letter to you from bed, Professor Alba, a bed from which I fear I may never again rise. Indeed, just the act of writing has left me pale and exhausted.
But this is not a letter merely bidding farewell to you and this world. You will find, in the envelope, the detailed plans for the aforementioned stitch (as well as for the protective coat). I cannot say what I want for you to do with them. Some days I hope you will set them aflame and think of them no more; other days I hope you will use them to start a line of vibrant and delightful socks to sell around the world.
But, Professor Alba, promise me this: if you choose the latter, make sure to warn the people, to let them know the truth, that these are not simply stitched socks.

This compact first aid kit is exactly what it says it is: a small kit for administering first aid. It has tweezers. It has scissors. And it has one bazillion (read: 121) pieces, including all the gauze, pads, bandages, and alcohol prep packs that you’d need to treat any (read: any NOT super major) wound you sustain while camping, or picnicking, or what have you. Its size makes it the ideal first aid kit to buy, leave in your car, and just forget about until you need it.
That’s all pretty simple.
But what comes next? This is what no one ever talks about: how to build and successfully administer a second aid kit. Luckily, we can help.
Step 1: Gather your supplies. You will need a chair (worn, in an endearing, well-loved way); a blanket (soft, warm, but not too warm); a cat (purring); and a remote control (to a Roku, Apple TV, or comparable).
Step 2: Apply ass to chair. (Optional, recline chair or use ottoman to extend legs).
Step 3: Apply blanket to lap and/or legs.
Step 4: Apply purring cat to blanket at lap area. Pet cat occasionally.
Step 5: Apply hand to remote; locate a binge-worthy show on your television; press play.
Step 6: When your significant other or roommate enters the room and asks if you’re really going to spend all day just sitting there watching television, sigh and say, “You’re right,” then move (very slightly) to get up, stopping only to hiss with pain and grasp at the injury area where the first aid was administered. (Optional: parlay sympathy, if shown, into your significant other or roommate bringing you a hot beverage of your choice: coffee, tea, cocoa, or apple cider.)
Step 7: When your significant other or roommate leaves the room, replace purring cat (if riled by your attempt to get up), rewind show as needed, and resume viewing.
There: you’ve successfully built and administered a second aid kit. Now, just buy this compact first aid kit, and you’ll be all set!"	0.04			2018-09-25T04:00:05.576Z	0.2809856978279806	0.95	74445

Overview: Very good, but not as good as Michael Keaton!!!
Before I get into my review, I want to give you a little bit of background: I’m a huge Michael Keaton fan and a software developer. Recently, I sold my start-up to a large tech conglomerate for several million dollars. I used that money to build a bunker inside an abandoned warehouse where I would live and wait for Michael Keaton to arrive so I can ask him a few continuity-related questions about his seminal 1996 comedy, Multiplicity, for my podcast: The Podkeast. I won’t list the questions here because I am certain they’ve never been asked and I want to be sure I’m the ones who asks them (more on this below, when I get into the complaints).
I need peace in my bunker to record episodes of The Podkeast and also to meditate and prepare myself for the eventual interview. Luckily, it’s soundproof. That brought up another issue, though: if I can’t hear anything, how will I know when Mike (that’s what I call him in my head sometimes) has arrived?
That’s where The Lynx 1080P Camera comes in! The quality’s great, they’re easy to set up, there’s free cloud storage, and most importantly, it has facial recognition. Using photos, I trained mine to only recognize one face: Michael Keaton’s. Thus, I’ll get a check-in notification whenever he arrives (fingers crossed, any day now!). Any other unfamiliar face alerts that come through I just ignore, because like I said, I don’t need the distractions.
I should say: I do have two complaints. One is that the Lynx recognizes faces really well, but not always the material said faces are made of. What I’m getting at is that my mom keeps showing up in a really realistic Michael Keaton mask (she probably bought it with the start-up money I gave her, ugh!). She always says the same thing: that she’s worried I might be losing my mind. It makes me want to scream. Like, of course I’m losing my mind! I got a check-in notification and thought Michael Friggin’ Keaton was here! And sometimes I do scream. Hey, it’s a sound-proof bunker, gotta get your money’s worth, right?
The other complaint I have is that Michael Keaton has not shown up to do the interview with me. This is probably more a don’t-have-Michael-Keaton’s-contact-info problem than a Lynx problem, but still: with that AND the mask issue, I didn’t feel right giving it five stars.
Overall, though, a very good camera!"	0.05			2018-09-24T04:00:11.601Z	0.2044531578210335	0.94	74861

When it comes to celebrating milestones, different people demand different amounts of ceremony. Some will require you to wear tuxedos and dinner gowns to the their wedding in a restored factory-turned-theater-space, wherein they will prepare a choreographed song and dance commemorating the various defining moments of their relationship. Others will go to the courthouse, sign a few documents, and send a text imploring you to meet them for beers later.
Whether it be a birthday, a successful defense of a PhD dissertation, or a housewarming party–everyone’s a little different. Not everyone wants gifts. But herein lies the one consistent rule, regardless of an event’s formality: if you’re bringing a gift, you have to put it in something festive. Because even the most casual soon-to-be mom isn’t going to stoked when you show up with a onesie still in the shipping box from VintageOnsiesRUs․com.
The problem? Wrapping is stressful. Wrap a gift poorly and you look like a degenerate. Wrap a gift too ornately and you seem like a bit of an over-achiever. Besides, not everything is easy to wrap. If you want to wrap an overstuffed plush starfish, you can either a) put it in a box and wrap that, or b) get your friend who’s an aerospace engineer to help you get the measurements and scissor placement just right so that it doesn’t come out looking like garbage.
Really, your best bet is to put that overstuffed plush starfish into a gift bag. Because the gift bag always looks good. It’s as fun-looking as wrapping paper and as easy as a shipping box. Plus, getting a gift in a gift bag rules. You’re basically getting two gifts, one of which you’re more than encouraged to regift later when you need to give someone else a gift.

You’ll notice that you have two choices on today’s sale. One is reasonable. The other is unreasonable. Or should we say: the other is an UNREASONABLY GOOD DEAL! You know what that means. It’s the return of:
ORDER/HOARDER
For those are unfamiliar, Order/Hoarder is when we offer you two options: a normal number of things for a good price, or an abnormally large number of things for a GREAT price. Today’s product:
Cooling towels!!!
So, let’s break it down:
The Math
“You can’t put a price on cool.” That’s something someone said in a movie once. It doesn’t matter who or what movie or if I just made it up, because it’s not true. You can put a price on being cool.
For example, if you just want to be double-cool (as in, get two cooling towels) you have to pay $12. That comes down to the totally reasonable per towel price of $6 (especially considering they’re $10 over on Amazon).
Now, here’s where it gets a bit more complicated. As we like to point out on these sales, when figuring out the price per unit of the Hoarder order, it’s not as simple as dividing the overall price ($36) by the number of units (12). BECAUSE, your can choose either 2 or 12, no in-betweens. Therefore, if you think about it, you’re already paying $6 for each of the first 2 towels, which means the last 10 towels are only costing you $24, or a mere $2.40 per towel! How about that deal, huh?!
What you can do with a normal order
It’s pretty simple. Cooling towels are not exactly all that, well, cool, but they are functional. With just two of them, you can use one as your main post-workout cool-down towel, and give the other to your spouse or partner. Or you can cycle through both yourself so you don’t have to do laundry as often.
What can you do with a Hoarder order
So much more! Here are just a few suggestions:


Go a day early and leave a cooling towel at each mile marker of your upcoming 20K race, so you never have to worry about getting too hot.


Take all of them and fashion them into a suit or cocktail dress to wear to outdoor weddings. But would a suit or dress made out of cooling towels really be classy enough for something like that? you might ask. To which we would respond: Could it be any less classy than a suit or dress soaked with sweat?


Sure, you could spend a bunch of money on an air conditioner and then a bunch of more money each month to run it. Or, you could save some cash by sewing yourself a delightful cooling towel quilt!


They’d make a great napkin alternative at your 12-guest “super spicy food banquet”.


Are you a do-gooder teen? Do you often dream of fashioning rope ladders out of clothes and blankets to lower yourself out your 2nd story bedroom window so you can run around after bedtime with your new rebellious friends? Only, your palms get so sweaty that you can’t get a good grip? Gosh, if only you could make a rope ladder out of something cool and soothing to the touch!


See? Maybe we were wrong. Maybe 12 cooling towels isn’t an unreasonable amount of cooling towels at all. On the other hand, you still have the option of buying the (completely boring) 2-pack. The decision is yours!

So again, we have no complaints about this particular karaoke system. Our complaint is about karaoke in general, or, to be more specific, about the musical artists we so often choose NOT to sing. That’s right: I’m talking about birds. Despite being nature’s original songwriters, you rarely hear anyone at a karaoke night sing a song by the many great bird-fronted musical groups out there, such as:

Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a child. Let’s call him @Dave. Dave wore Sears-brand Toughskin jeans. They were, as their name implied, durable and long-lasting. But, like most economically practical things, corners needed to be cut to keep them affordable, and, unfortunately for Dave, the corner Toughskin jeans cut was the let’s-make-these-things-look-cool corner.
Or maybe not unfortunately. Because Dave rarely felt self-conscious in his Toughskin jeans. What did make him feel self-conscious was when, in the mid-80s, his grandparents splurged and got him a Generra sweatshirt. It was “in.” Very “in.” In fact, you could say that it was so deeply “in” that the brand couldn’t find its way out of the decade.
Suddenly, all the other kids at school were stopping Dave in the hallway to say, “Cool sweatshirt,” and, after years of remaining invisible behind the Toughskin curtain, he didn’t know how to react to such a compliment. It was uncomfortable.
Dave has come a long way since then… or has he? No, he doesn’t wear Toughskin jeans anymore, but he still has a Toughskin mindset. He’s not afraid of bright purple laptops or speakers that are loud in both function and design. This, in some ways, is his calling: espousing the virtues of things that don’t look exactly like you’d hope but work just fine.
But he doesn’t exactly know what to do with these slick-looking Rowkin Bluetooth Ear Buds.
Does he say: just because Meh sells some stuff that has substance but lacks style does NOT mean the stylish stuff we sell lacks substance in equal measure? Does he point out that many of the negative reviews on Amazon that have driven the average rating down to an unimpressive 3 stars can be put into 3 categories:

people complaining about the hefty (non-Meh) price tag;
people who struggled with a weird issue that was corrected easily by a factory reset; and
people hating on Bluetooth technology as a whole?

Does he mention that many reviews were impressed with both their size and sound quality (and again, that those people were reviewing after, presumably, paying some 50 bucks more the price they are offered at here)?
No. @Dave does none of these things. He has a copywriter do it, duh."	0.05			2018-09-20T04:00:02.850Z	0.2538143856831479	0.92	72743

As we’ve mentioned before, we recently won an auction for a storage locker that was filled entirely with branded content romance novels. Or so we thought. But, picking through the titles, we actually found many belonged to a branded content epic fantasy series by the author L.L.R. Holdien about a warrior named Tarklaw The Powerful. Luckily for us, there’s a chapter in book 19 about today’s product, the Keysmart (and Keysmart Pro).

Having successfully freed the shape-shifting wizard Vintel, son of Filor The Great, from the floating prison of Delkabana, narrowly escaping the light-spears of the Meschlen Guards by leaping through a portal leading somewhere that only a seer like Wise Crin might intuit–Tarklaw found himself deposited into murky waist-high water.
“Vintel?” Tarklaw called out, trying to locate the wizard whom he had just a moment ago saved, despite their families’ centuries-long acrimonious relations.
“I’m right here, Tarklaw,” Vintel seemed to whisper into his ear, buzzingly. “As a shape-shifting wizard, it is my custom to acclimate my shape to the environs, and so I have taken the form a mosquito because we, bitter-family-enemy-turned-savior, appear to be in a swamp.”
“Not just any swamp! The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors!” came a voice that belonged neither to Tarklaw or Vintel, but another in their vicinity. Tarklaw turned quickly, drawing his great sword with a shing sound common of sword-drawing. But he found only a small creature not unlike an unshelled tortoise, swimming towards them. “Forgive me for startling you! I am Rewn, peaceful leader of the Melorians, the primary inhabitants of this swamp at the edge of the Planet Glor at the far reaches of the Heplan Galaxy. Now, I imagine you’ve come here through some pesky portal or other, but fear not: your exit is easily made through one of the Eight Astounding Doors.”
“Doors?” Said Tarklaw. “I am from the planet Phentalon, a place without doors, due to our peoples’ openness with each other.”
“Very noble,” Rewn said. “Perhaps one day, The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors shall be like that. For now, you must choose one. They go to any number of worlds, from the euphorically beautiful mountain-scape of Relan to the hellish fire-deserts of Dumask. And we have all the keys right here…” Rewn dipped under the water for a moment, but re-emerged with a perplexed look upon his creaturely face. “Oh, dear! They were right there a moment ago.”
“You simply allow all keys to be strewn throughout a swamp?” buzzed Vintel.
“Not exactly,” Rewn said, explanatorily. “We keep them all together using an ingenious contraption known as a KeySmart. Made of aircraft aluminum, it can hold eight keys–or as many as fourteen, with an expansion pack! Additionally, it includes a loop for keys belonging to vehicles propelled by motors. Not to mention, its extended frame can hold long or foreign keys, which is especially important to us, as one of our oldest and most prized keys is made from the hollow bird-like finger bone of the fallen Hilderan Mage Lazlorn.”
“But,” Vintel buzzed, contrarily, “as ingenious and organizationally optimized as that all sounds, it seems at present not to be helping in your ability to locate them.”
“Ah, yes, that would be true if it were the base model, which is still good,” Rewn said. “Luckily for us, we opted for the Pro. Not only does it have a built-in LED flashlight and bottle opener; it can also show a map of your missing keys, and by way of the Tile app–which can be accessed via your smartphone or tablet–you can make your keys ring out loud! Of course, I should add at this juncture that the ‘water’ here in the The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors is different in elemental makeup to that of the water on other planets, such as Earth.”
“Are you saying,” Vintel buzzed, clarifyingly, “that just because we are discussing the KeySmart Pro being used in a water-based situation, it should not be taken as an endorsement of it being waterproof?”
“Exactly,” cried Rewn, disclaimingly.
“Much like doors, smartphones and tablets are concepts foreign to my home world,” Tarklaw said. “But that sounds like a great functional product nonetheless.”
“And I will show you just how functional it is!” Rewn cried with excitement. He brought forward a device and opened the Tile app. A moment later, a ding rang out, though it sounded muffled. The three of them turned… and stood facing a giant glowing snake-like beast. It emerged from the water, standing nearly forty Glorian theltans tall, or forty feet tall in Earth measurements, Glorian theltans being exactly equal to terrestrial feet. The ding sounded again, from somewhere deep inside of the monster’s abdomen.
“Oh no! A Mirelord! Run!” Rewn cried with fear. “Or, better yet, swim.” And with that, he disappeared under the water.
But Tarklaw did not swim away. He crouched into a combat ready position as best he could in the deep murky water. The Mirelord leaned closer to him, its eyes alight with evil.
“What are you doing?” buzzed Vintel into his ear, questioningly.
“We must get out of this swamp,” Tarklaw cried. “This is the only way. Though, it will be hard for just the two of us to defeat it…”
“Perhaps, I can help?” came a distinguished voice from Tarklaw’s side.
Tarklaw turned, and saw… no! He couldn’t believe it! “Hinton, son of Raquille, wielder of The Great Axe Of Orlagos, and best friend since birth of Tarklaw The Powerful? But I thought you were–”
“The immortal prisoner of the Inter-dimensional Pirate Lop, locked away in the his ship, The Pummeling Ewlok, for all of eternity?” Hinton laughed. “Not a chance in Dumask, my friend! Now, what do you say we free the aforementioned product from the belly of the beast? Just like old times?”
Tarklaw couldn’t help but smile. “Just like old times, indeed,” he said, and they raised their weapons to the approaching Mirelord."	0.05			2018-09-19T04:00:10.856Z	0.34612555704581827	0.93	72268

One time, I left without remembering to close the door.
I was living in a house somewhere so rural we didn’t need to lock up, and, in a rush to leave (I was going on a trip), I forgot to swing the door all the way closed, leaving only the screen door between my cat and freedom. He was fine. My mom checked on him the next day and, much to her surprise, he emerged from under the deck after spending what must’ve been, for an indoor cat, a terrifying night outside.
Just about every time I have left the house since then, even if just for an hour, I have wondered: “did I close the door? Did I lock the door? Do the pets have food? Do they have water? Did I leave the oven on? Did I unconsciously light seven candles and place them precariously close to window curtains that are, unbeknownst to me, highly flammable?” Many times, I have gone back to check. Never have I left the stove on. Never have I found candles flickering. The pets have always been fine. Only once or twice have I found the door unlocked.
Still, I never regret it, because it’s nicer to know everything’s fine than it is to hope everything’s fine.
And that’s really what these Zmodo MeShare cameras are for: making sure. You can call them “security cameras,” but that feels a little overstated. Maybe it would be better to rebrand them as “check-in cameras.” After all, the chances that you’re going to tune in as your home is being burglarized–thus allowing you to call the authorities while the burglary is in progress–is very low. I mean, hell, the actual likeliness of your home being burglarized at all is very low. And if your first thought upon reading that is, Nuh-uh, my home gets broken into all the time, we won’t argue with you. But we will say: you probably need more than a couple Zmodos.
Otherwise, these are a good option for the second-guessers out there to quell all the concerns that might flare up during your day at work: whether you just want to make sure everything’s fine, or to check that you didn’t forget to close the windows, or to monitor whether your dog is feeling okay after eating something stupid that he wasn’t supposed to…

So, the first thing you need to know is that these are little. They’re for kids or pets, not full-sized adults. So if you’re looking for sectional solution for game day with your buddies: this is no good… unless you’re, like, 10 and so are all your buddies (in which case, make sure you ask your parents before you buy this thing, okay? See! We’re responsible!)
The second thing you need to know is that the backs velcro on, and the seats have magnets in them, which makes them “infinitely configurable.” And yet, if that’s the case, then why is are these proposed layouts so BORING?! They’re mostly just couches. Where’s the fun in that? Why not try something more exciting, like these three designs:
You’re Number One

Will anyone even see that it’s a #1? Probably not. Is it really a practical way to lay out a room? No. But the subliminal reassurance that the design will provide for your child is massive. Every time they sit down they’ll think, “Hey, you know what: I’m special!” And this confidence will push them to do great things.
Game Room

Checkers is simple and boring on a board… but what about in a room, with you and all of your friends as the pieces? To make it more exciting: institute a rule where it’s not as easy as just “jumping” another piece; instead, you have to battle for it. Whoever doesn’t get cast into one of the empty spaces (i.e. onto the floor) wins!
Soft Kitchen

Okay, this isn’t exactly innovative, design-wise. But in terms of utility? Think about it: you cover the floor of your kitchen, wall-to-wall, with Sactionals, and now, suddenly, you can drop a glass or a ceramic mug and it won’t shatter! Plus, they’re machine washable, in case there’s a spill. Best of all, if you need to keep an eye on something you’ve got baking, you can just lay down next to the oven and watch it!

A cheers to the sun (which, upon revealing itself, around a bend in the highway, will show you just how little you clean the inside of your windshield)!


A cheers to vacation (which is defined as a trip that occurs when someone, delirious from the heat, begins to think, you know what I bet would be great?

Dear @reclaimercube,
On September 2nd, you posted the following comment on a knife sale:

Meh I have anxiously been awaiting for you to post a toothbrush for sale again. I will post this everyday until you finally sell another one again.

And, @reclaimercube, can we tell you something? We’re very proud of you. Because you kept your word. Since then, each day, you’ve put forward this same request.
Your fellow Meh customers began to notice. One post from Friday, September 7th sparked a discussion that involved more than 20 comments. In that conversation, someone pointed out a toothbrush for sale on a competitor’s site. You, ever strong, refused to take the bait:

not a bad deal… But not on meh so it doesn’t matter. You could link me to colgate’s website or crest’s website for a free toothbrush and I still wouldn’t want it unless it was on meh. I’m chaining myself to this statue. Ride or die mehbrother.

Your repeated request did not specify why you wanted a toothbrush, or what kind of toothbrush you wanted. Really, you haven’t even promised that you’d buy the toothbrush. You’ve only asked, repeatedly, for us to “post a toothbrush.”
Well, good news, @reclaimercube: when we launched Meh, we made a decision. Once, and only once, we would allow a Meh customer to dictate exactly what we’d sell. The only rule was they had to make the request for 13 consecutive days. They could ask for $1 MacBooks, or free puppies, or Cadillac Escalades filled with cash. It didn’t matter. There were no restrictions, aside from the 13 days. Some of us worried the financial hit would be too much, but others felt assured: we could trust our customers! They wouldn’t make unreasonable demands!
So thank you, @reclaimercube; you’ve shown us that our faith was not misplaced. Now, Meh community, let’s all come together and celebrate with this build-your-own-bundle of toothbrushes.
Sincerely,
Meh

Hair: it is the ultimate example of disobedience.
You can train puppies to pee outside, to walk next to you, to sit, to shake, to do any number of fun and/or useful things. With cats, the job is much harder, but with some persistence (and a spray bottle) it is possible to enforce a few rules: you do not yowl in the middle of the night, you do not walk on the kitchen counter, you do not knock our decorative trinkets off the mantle as a game. Even a bonsai can be coaxed, over time, to grow a certain way.
But not hair. Nope, no matter how many times you comb, shave, style, epilate, and wax: it can just never take the fucking hint!
You know that person in your  your life who’s like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “hmm, maybe?” And you hope they’ll just drop it, but then a day later, they’re like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “I don’t know if that dumb thing is really a good idea.” Which should be clear as hell, but they don’t want to listen, so they keep prodding and prodding until you’re like, “Look,  I don’t want to do the dumb thing because it is dumb, and honestly, I’m worried you might be dumb for suggesting it, and I might be dumb for being the friend of such a dumb person.” And you feel terrible but they just smile and say, “C’mon! It’ll be great!”
That’s hair. No matter how many times you try to send the message that you don’t want it to come back there, it keeps coming back there. It is untrainable!
Or is that the wrong way to look at it? Could it be that we are the untrainable ones? That our hair is not being a stubborn learner but a tenacious teacher? That it wants to lead us to a better place? A place where we eschew the standards of beauty thrust upon us? Because isn’t it pretty arbitrary where we say there should be hair and where we say there should not? On the head is good, but not on the face? Except some faces capable of growing thick enough hair? On the chest is okay, but no, never on the back? Not on the legs, but okay on the arms, except in the armpits? Could it be that our hair’s persistence is its way of saying: you need to get the hell over it and just be who you are?

The three brothers had been cleaning out their grandfather’s basement for nearly two hours before they found the FoodSaver.
“What’s this?” said Kyle, holding it up.
“Looks old,” said Jake. “I’d guess circa second half of the 2010’s.”
Terry took it from Kyle and inspected it. “Wait, I know these things. It’s an early model weed-sealer. You know? The devices for vacuum-packing weed so it wouldn’t go bad.”
“All this talk of weed remind me, have you guys taken your three o’clock edibles yet?” Jake asked.
Kyle and Terry nodded.
“But wait,” Kyle said, “why does it say FoodSaver on it, if it’s for weed?”
“You have to understand, Kyle, this was before weed was legal everywhere,” Terry explained. “They didn’t even put it in the water back then!”
Kyle looked at the FoodSaver perplexed. “Really?”
“I’m serious,” Terry said. “So people weren’t as acclimated to it as we are now. They considered it a drug. Thus, when people took some, they got ‘high,’ which basically meant they thought without logic. So it’s likely that the inventor of the ‘FoodSaver’ only named it such because he was super high, and probably pretty hungry.”
“So strange to think that the same substance that keeps us calm and measured, used to have almost the opposite effect!” Kyle said.
Now Jake had the FoodSaver. “Are you sure this is a weed-sealer? To me, it looks like an early sous-vide-assistant. That would make more sense with the FoodSaver name.”
“Did they even sous vide back then?” Terry asked.
“Sure,” Jake said. “It was more of a luxury, though, given that it was before the Microwave And Oven Act of 2035.”
“When I read about those times, and all the negative-energy-pollution caused by those now illegal kitchen appliances, it just makes me sick,” Terry said.
“Guys, you’ve got me thinking…” Kyle paused to gather his thoughts. “Well, you know how when we put stuff in the freezer, it just freezes together and gets covered in weird ice?”
“They’re called water diamonds, Kyle,” Terry said.
“They mean the moisture has accepted the food, so we know it’s safe to eat,” Jake said.
“I’m well aware of them and what they mean. Don’t forget, I’m the one who studied health at Dove For Men Presents: College. But I was thinking, the food doesn’t always taste good after the water diamonds form.” Kyle took the FoodSaver from Jake. “And I know this is going to sound crazy, but if this thing could keep weed fresh, and be used with food products for sous-vide purposes, maybe we could combine the two functions. Like, we could use it to seal food before we freeze it so it stays fresher longer.”
“You mean, you want to eat food that’s been frozen but hasn’t emitted its proper water diamonds?” Terry said.
“Isn’t that illegal?” Jake added.
“Sure, on Earth. But not here,” Kyle said, “on Mars.”
Jake and Terry had to admit he had a point: they definitely had been on Mars this whole time."	0.05			2018-09-13T04:00:05.184Z	0.21097046413502127	0.92	62121

As someone who doesn’t brush his hair much, Wet Brushes look, to me, like normal brushes. But looks can be deceiving. Or, in this case, the looks are deceivingly simple. In truth, everything I’ve read about them states, quite simply, that they’re best brushes around. And today, we’re selling a pack of three: one pro, one pop fold, and one paddle.
They’re all designed specifically to brush out tangles without pain or tugging. They work especially well on wet hair, but can be used on dry hair too, even wigs and extensions. The paddle features “AquaVents” that help with ventilation and drying as you brush. In short, they sound great. But again, I don’t brush my hair really ever, so if you don’t want to take my word for it–or the word of the many happy customers over on Amazon–then maybe these totally real reviews from absolutely not-made-up hair professionals will help seal the deal:

The Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet is pretty simple: it’s a wallet that comes with a powerpack, which can be used to charge your phone or other devices.
In a way, to recharge something is to refill it, but unfortunately, while the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet does fill your wallet in the literal sense–like, there is a powerpack inside of it–it can’t refill your wallet in the figurative sense–as in, recharge your bank account.
Or can it?
Because think about this: what kind of phone is the most likely to have a short battery life? An old phone! And maybe you have an upgrade waiting for you, but you don’t want to dish out the money for one. Because maybe, with your provider, it’s not as simple as handing over $200 and getting a new iPhone. Now, you pay for the upgrade via a small increase in your monthly bill–a small increase that over time accumulates into a lot of money. And it’s very possible that this change was made because people like you: people who buy a phone and then ride it into the ground, thus spending a couple hundred bucks every six years, rather than evert two like your cell company–let’s call them Werizon–would prefer.
And so now you’ve got a geriatric phone that needs a pick-me-up every few hours to make it through the day, and you’re not always near an outlet, so one of these Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallets–‘wallets’ plural because you get a 2-pack–is just what you need. It’s your wallet, so it’s not like you’ll forget it. Thus, you’ll always have some charge on hand, which means you don’t need to upgrade, which means your phone bill won’t go up, which means you’ll save money, which, in conclusion, means the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet can, in fact, recharge both your phone and your wallet!

I remember being a kid, riding in my parents’ car at night, and dropping something. Maybe a toy or a quarter. It doesn’t matter what. What matters is I reached up and turned on the dome light to find the object in question. And it was then that my dad freaked the fuck out. You would’ve thought I’d tossed hot acid in his eyes. “Turn that off! I can’t see anything!” he claimed. He might’ve even swerved a little, for emphasis. As a dutiful child, I switched the light off as quickly as possible to avoid careening off the road into a ditch.
Flash forward some years: I have a license. I have a car. A friend is riding with me. He turns on the dome light for something and… everything is fine.
The same thing happened the first time I helped jumpstart a car. I’d been told so many times about everything that can go terribly wrong that I felt sure that it would end in a) an deadly storm of electricity and fire; or b) one or both of the cars being fried for good. Turns out, if you, ya know, just follow instructions, it works out fine.
If anything, the greatest risk of jumping a car–the one that no amount of how-to articles or Youtube videos can save you from–is the risk of wasting a favor. Because think about it: you spend all that time being a good friend and building up positive equity until you’ve almost got enough to cash in for pet care or help shlepping some furniture from your old apartment to your new one… Then your car battery farts out and now your buddy is driving over in the cold to help you get it started again.
That’s where this iJoy Jump Starter Kit comes in. Not only will it charge your phone and provide some you with some light; it’ll make it so that you don’t need to dip into the favor bank just to get your car running.

Another super villain attacking the city, another mad rush downtown. We newspaper photographers are the real heroes, Roy thought to himself with a chuckle as he ran from the Gazette office into the mayhem, clutching his camera to his chest.
It was a joke, of course. Roy didn’t think he was more heroic than the Scarlet Savior. But he could relate to her in one way: like her, he never had any help. After layoffs there were just two of them in the photography department; they outsourced the rest. And it just so happened that whenever disaster struck, Lorraine was rushing off to take care of “a personal issue.”
What a coincidence, Roy thought. Always trying to get out of work! Then something else occurred to him: was it possible that Lorraine was, in fact, the alter ego of–
A taxi honked at Roy as he sprinted across the street toward the sounds of lasers and maniacal laughter a few blocks away. “Watch where you’re going buddy!” the diver yelled.
“I’m working!” Roy yelled back.
“Yeah, yeah,” the driver said. “Well, we’re all working too. Working on staying alive in this damn city!”
Roy laughed. Not at the man but at the theory the honk had charitably eradicated from his mind. Lorraine couldn’t be the Scarlet Savior. Sure, they both had striking red hair, but the Scarlet Savior always wore a matching Treasure Island jewelry set–one necklace, one bracelet, both made out of genuine gemstones and pearls–whereas Lorraine wore a single longer Treasure Island necklace, which was also made of genuine gemstones and pearls.
Well, that settles that! Roy thought. And just in time too! Because here she came, the Scarlet Savior, flying through the sky, blazing a red path through the sky that, strangely, looked like it originated on the roof of the Gazette’s offices.

We sold these just a couple months ago, but it seems like we were so young then. We thought: are people really going to pay five more dollars for a little bit more unzippability? We even exaggerated the difference in the write-up as a joke, thinking: sure, some are going to want that extra accessibility, but a lot of people are just looking for something functional for as cheap as possible.
We were so arrogant, so naive.
The actual sales breakdown helped us see the light:

So, this time, we’re trying something a little different. We’re dropping the price of both but not by the same amount: for the one with multiple zippers, the price will be just a buck lower, whereas, the single-zipper version will be a whopping $5 less than last time. For those keeping score at home: that’s now a $9 difference between the two.
In some ways, this isn’t simply a sale; it’s an experiment. We want to answer the question: what is a zipper truly worth?

There are three potential outcomes to buying this Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk:
Outcome 1
You buy the standing desk. You’re intrigued by its promises of a stronger core, healthier circulation, improved productivity, and better posture. But the truth is, you don’t care for it. You’ve spent your entire life believing that getting work done requires sitting down and shutting up. So how do you expect, as an adult, to change your working position? Maybe if you gave it more time… but you don’t want to. You just want to use it as a normal desk. And that’s fine! Because this thing didn’t cost north of $600 like some models out there; it cost less than $200. And look, that’s not nothing, but it was a worthwhile gamble.
Outcome 2
You love your new standing desk. But it’s not enough. Once you taste the thrill of working upright, you want more. You quickly replace your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk with a treadmill desk. You start out walking, but soon enough you’re outright sprinting while you manage your spreadsheets and respond to emails. You get a kiddy pool and set it up behind the treadmill, filling it with a medley of pirañas and water moccasins. Now, any slowdown and you’re in trouble. But even that’s not enough. You take out the water moccasins, extract their venom, and put it in an IV that runs directly into your arm. The anti-venom is in another IV that you’ve rigged to only administer as you meet your hourly sales goals. Your friends and family members are worried about you, but you’ve never felt more alive! And it all started with the Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk!
Outcome 3
You get your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk, and you like it. You crank it up to standing height for a few hours of the day; for the rest of the time, you use it as a normal desk. You’re neither disappointed, nor unsatisfied. It meets your needs, and you will use it for the foreseeable future.

Shaving is the blandest and yet most grueling task of every personal grooming regimen. It is a zero sum game: you can put it off, but that only means it’ll be a longer and more grueling process when eventually you do get around to it. It’s like mowing the lawn, except without the exercise, and the smell of fresh cut grass replaced by the noxious chemical odor of shave gel. In short, it’s miserable.
Or it was. Until now. Enter these “Famous Maker” razors. Famous Maker? you say. But who IS the famous maker? That’s just the thing, we can’t tell you. And now suddenly, shaving is an act of immeasurable mystery and excitement!
Could it be that these razors are the excess produced by an underground razor factory located far below Park City? Perhaps for the original purpose of being distributed, in secret, to the agents and publicists and personal assistants of actors in town for the Sundance Film Festival? So that these various agents and publicists and assistants could sneak into the actors’ hotel rooms at night and shave their faces clean while they slept? Because maybe the actors, having escaped the always-on environs of Los Angeles, wanted to let themselves go, but the various men and women whose livelihoods relied on their pristine image had other things in mind?
Or could it be that the razors are from a different hidden factory, a facility built into the side of one of the Alps? For a baron? A baron who volunteered to host the worldwide beard and mustache contest at his expansive villa? While harboring a secret hatred of all facial hair? And so the plan was not to celebrate these growers of elaborate beards and mustaches, but to trap them and then use the razors to, as the baron said in a private correspondence, “reveal their cheeks upper lips once again to the world”? Maybe he even wanted to shave the hair on their head too, just to prove a point? Only his scheme was discovered by the lowly helper-boy tasked with taking his correspondence to the post office? And so the baron had no choice but to sell off his stock of razors in an effort to cut (pun intended) his losses?
Or could it be a pretty basic story of a razor company having some leftover razors that they wanted to offload? Only they couldn’t do so under their own name? Because then people would be like, “but wait, I just spent this much on these at the store, but now you’re selling them for cheap online? That’s bullshit!”?
Okay, for purposes of whimsy, let’s just ignore that last scenario. Instead, focus on the first two, buy these razors, and shave with an entirely new sense of intrigue!"	0.05			2018-09-05T04:00:15.298Z	0.26119278036366067	0.93	62903

Or so I thought…
Then I went to do some research on Amazon and saw a question about what material was used to make the pivot washers and how thick the blade is. The first answer reads as follows:

Sorry, this was a gift for someone in Arizona so I can’t answer your question. I can only say that the knife is substantial!

So, how thick is the blade?
Great question! I’d guess that it’s probably about the same as other knives like it, although it could be thicker. But even then, it wouldn’t be too much thicker, because that would be weird, right?
I’m reading that it has a “stonewashed drop-point blade.” That sounds intense. What kind of stuff can you use it for?
I bet it would be pretty good at cutting through most stuff you’d use a knife like this for, but I don’t feel comfortable naming specific stuff because I’ve never used one. I will say this, though: there’s a good chance it can cut through butter. And an even better chance if the butter has been left out of the fridge for a little while.
Was it designed by Bill Harsey?
Sure was! As to who Bill Haresay is, lol, idk! I would venture to guess he does something in the knife industry.
One reviewer says that it is 11.8"" long when it’s extended. Is that longer than other knives?
Not sure. It is definitely not as long as a foot, because a foot is 12"". With that being said, another reviewer posted a photo of it next to another knife and a tape measurer, if that helps. It is bigger than the other knife, but not the tape measurer (which is good, because those things can get really long).
Wow! This is so easy! It’s great to finally realize how much a knife expert I really am! Thanks Amazon question answerer, for showing me the way.

This Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble may seem simple enough. It’s 6 100% ceramic products with matching designs: a toothbrush holder, a tumbler, a soap dish, a lotion dispenser, a tissue box, and a trash bin. None of these things require much explanation. What does deserve some attention, though, is the multi-stage process that one goes through when deciding to buy one or all of them. We’ve laid it out below:
Stage 1: Intrigue
These are interesting. The various pieces look stylish, and they all match. It might be nice to have a motif that really brings the entire bathroom together.
Stage 2: Skepticism
But do I really need any of these? The old coffee mug we put the toothbrushes in works just fine, as does the little wicker basket we’ve got for trash. The sink already has a built-in soap dish. This one would be easier to clean, but do you really need to clean something when all it does is hold soap? Isn’t soap itself essentially the concept of cleanliness made solid? Lotion bottles already come with a pump top and tissue boxes are their own tissue dispensers, really. Am I supposed to re-package things? Isn’t that adding unnecessary steps?
Stage 3: Re-evaluation
Yes, I guess technically it is adding unnecessary steps, but all in the service of style. And maybe that’s worth it. Which would maybe mean the steps aren’t unnecessary?
*Stage 4: Introspection
And what does it say about me that I’m so put off by these objectively simple tasks? Like, it isn’t hard to empty some lotion from one thing into another thing. It isn’t hard to put a box of tissues inside another box. Or clean a soap dish. Just like it isn’t hard to put a new bag in the garbage after I take the trash out. But I never do, not right away at least. I always wait hours, sometimes even a whole day, leaving paper towels and granola bar wrappers on the kitchen counter, until finally my desire for a clean surface outweighs my laziness. At which point I put a new bag in the garbage can and am reminded that the laziness was all to avoid something that takes mere seconds. And yet, when next I need to take out the trash, this process will repeat. Making matters worse: someday it might not just be taking out the trash. Someday it might be dirty diapers I’m dealing with. It might be taking kids to the doctor. It might taking the medication I need to stay alive. And when that time comes will I just attempt to put it off? I want to say no, that I’ll be past all of this by then, that I’ll finally be a responsible organized adult… but an I’m adult now, damnit! I should already be better than this!
Stage 5: Ascension
That’s it! No more! I’m going to buy every item in this Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble, not just because it’s stylish and will tie my bathroom together nicely! No, that’s all secondary. Really, I’m doing it to prove to everyone–but especially myself–that I’m capable of taking the right steps and building good habits! New me, here we come!
Stage 6: Regression
Purchase made! Now, it’s time for bed. Shit, wait? It’s trash day tomorrow, isn’t it? I should take the bin to the curb. Although, there really are only a couple bags in there. I’m sure I’d be fine until next week…"	0.07			2018-09-01T04:00:01.758Z	0.3734081588603498	0.94	49783

There’s an old saying about innovation: “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.” It is derived from an Emerson quote that reads: “If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.” In this way, the saying is an example of itself; the ‘mousetrap’ variant is shorter, snappier, and conveys the exact same meaning, thus it is the one most often used.
The implication here is basically if you build it, they will come: you’ll have lines around the block, people from all over frantically waving their bills in the air demanding the latest in mouse-entrapment technology.
The truth, we know now, is a bit different.
The world, upon beating a path to your door, would say, “This mousetrap is smaller and more humane than the previous mousetrap, but now I’ve decided I want a mousetrap that is smaller and more humane.” Or, “I have no mice in my house, but many spiders, and this mousetrap did not catch a single spider, which is a bit of a disappointment.” Or, “Excuse me, I have some ideas for how you might make this better mousetrap–which is a good start–into an even greater mousetrap, despite the fact that I have never myself built any mousetrap.”
And so it goes with the Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Pack. You can put it in the microwave if you need heat, or you can put in the freezer if you want it to be cold. The ceramic beads heat and cool with the gel, providing a nice texture, which one Amazon reviewer says, “makes for an easy massage.” But the title of that review–“slightly different than the norm”–is telling. It implies that the incorporation of a heretofore never used component is something slight. Innovation, people seem to believe, requires a total redo.
Yes, some reviews expressed issues with durability. That’s understandable to call out. A few wished it would be more pliable when frozen. Again, fair.
But then there are the other “complaints.”
One says: “The only drawback I’ve seen so far to this item is its size. For the most part, I don’t think the size will be an issue because it’s probably rare to treat an area larger than 6x10”.""
Just so we’re clear: the only issue this reviewer could foresee would arise in a scenario that they couldn’t foresee arising.
Another–in a review titled “Does the job but not much better than competition”–claims: “the problem is just like every other reusable gel back I’ve ever used: they simply don’t remain truly hot or cold enough for long enough to do a good job. They’re more warm or cool than they are hot or cold for much longer.”
To put it differently: the biggest problem with this product, in this reviewer’s experience, is endemic to this entire product category, not just this product, and relies upon a universal tolerance of hot and cold temperatures.
The point of all this is to show that people will always find things to gripe about. And maybe they’re right. Still, it seems like the best case scenario is that you really love the texture of the ceramic beads inside the gel, and the worst case scenario is that you get three of totally passable hot/cold packs for $18.

Here we go again! The return of The Skeptics Choice, our occasional write-up segment wherein we read what a product claims to do and say, “hmm… I don’t know…” Today, we’re talking about a PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser. Follow along, won’t you?
The Claim
For all those who are thinking that we’ve been through this all before, fear not: this is a different kind of diffuser than the one we sold last time. This one is a “one-of-a-kind product combines the therapeutic properties of a pure Himalayan salt rock lamp with the soothing aromatherapy of an essential oil diffuser.” Apparently, it sets “the perfect mood for relaxation at home” and provides “all the benefits you would expect from this powerful combo.”
The Skepticism
That last part is a little presumptuous. All the benefits I would expect? I understand each word in the phrase “Himalayan Salt Lamp” on its own, but I know nothing about what they mean when they’re put together. But that’s no bother! It’s all laid out right there in the marketing copy:


The first benefit is that it will “help boost your mood.” And honestly, that sounds legit! When you’ve had your windows shut for almost 12 consecutive months because it took just a single day for the seasons transition from the bitter cold of winter to the brutal humidity of summer, something that makes the air smell pretty can be a nice little pick-me-up.


The second benefit is that it can “increase energy levels.” This seems a little more like bullshit than the first claim, but it’s vague enough that I’m willing to give it a pass.


The third benefit is that it will “neutralize the positively charged ions that emit from electronic devices like smartphones, televisions, radios, and more.”


Umm, what the fuck? That sure escalated quickly.
Seriously, the difference in hysteria levels from “it might boost your mood” to “it’ll protect you from killer ions” is about equal to the difference between a “hang in there, kitty” poster and one of those spam posts from MySpace that was like, “Post this on 10 of your friends’ profiles or else your eyes will fall out.”
And by the way, I’m not against a lot of this stuff. Crystals are fine. Astrology is fine. You could argue that it’s unscientific, but that’s missing the point. Life sucks sometimes. If getting some stones to put in your pocket makes you feel less like you’re flying a cloud of chaos towards an inevitably disappointing conclusion, more power to you! I watch groups of men in polyester play what is basically an IRL-board game involving sticks and balls on an enormous grass-and-dirt field, and if the group of men I like outplays the group of men I don’t like, I feel profound happiness. So, I try not to judge people for the things they use to pass the time.
But I will ABSOLUTELY judge anyone who preys upon someone based on those things. Because that’s what they’re doing here. They’re not saying: “you like this thing? we make this thing~” They’re saying, “we make this thing! it is DANGEROUS not to have this thing!!!” In other words, it’s taking something that should be a distraction from the chaos of daily life–which it totally could be, by the way: it’s cool looking; it lights up; it smells nice–and turning it into part of the chaos of daily life. And that’s messed up.
(Also, sorta tangential but still relevant, it’s problematic in a whole other way: What’s dangerous about technology is not that it’s pumping the air full of ions; it’s how intrusive it is. For example, did you know that if you say “Bloody Mary” three times into your smart phone, an ad for “great local brunch spots” will appear on your Facebook timeline? Our devices are definitely listening to us. We can all agree on that, right? Fine, maybe I’m just being paranoid. But you have to know that every Google search, every purchase, every photo you post is being mined for important data. And so making it a conversation about “ions” is pushing it in a direction that helps no one but those selling PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffusers.)
The Conclusion
If you want a thing that lights up and looks cool and smells nice, this is a good investment. If you’re thinking about buying this because you’re afraid to breath in all the electro-turds you released into the air while binging Sharp Objects, maybe open a window?"	0.05			2018-08-30T04:00:02.770Z	0.20794343938448737	0.93	60935

1.

I’m a lawyer, but right now, I’m not in the courtroom. Instead, it’s late at night and I’m in my office, wearing Ray-Ban glasses, poring over all the evidence of this grueling case, trying to find something to prove my client is innocent. All the older lawyers at this firm didn’t want to take my client on, and I’m starting to see why, but then again, I’m a young perky go-getter. Sometimes I worry that I’m too concerned with upholding justice, that I get too wrapped up in what’s right and wrong, that I fall in love with too many of my clients. But I can’t think about that now. I need to squint through my Ray-Bans at this piece of paper, then dig out another piece of paper and squint at that one, before realizing I’ve found it: a small but pretty obvious detail that proves my client wasn’t there that night. Thanks, Ray-Bans! I couldn’t have done it without you.

2.

I’m a bit of a nerd. You can tell because I’m always wearing these thick Ray-Ban frames. Also, I’m always doing nerdy things like taking notes in class or carrying a lot of books. Sometimes I drop them, to the delight of cheerleaders and jocks. My best friend is quirky and outgoing, but I am not. I have a figure that would require a nutritionist and hours of gym time each day to maintain, but you can’t see it under these bulky sweaters that I wear, while sitting in my bedroom listening to non-aggressive indie rock or reading an obscure book like Wuthering Heights or The Collected Plays of William Shakespeare. Perhaps someday, someone will move here from out of town and crack this high school’s social hierarchy wide open, but until then it’s just me, my one quirky friend, my books, my sweaters, and my Ray-Ban glasses.

3.

I’m what you might call a savant. I’m always doing things like solving unsolvable math equations, or going to the park and playing five games of chess at a time… and winning. The crisp lines of my Ray-Ban frames are definitely in stark contrast with my wildly disheveled hair! Can I tell you something? I wasn’t surprised to see the government suits show up at my house. What did surprise me was when they took me to the research facility and showed me what they found. I stared at it for a whole a minute. Then I dramatically took off my Ray-Ban glasses, wiped them on my shirt, and stared at it for a minute longer. I didn’t know what I was looking at. What I did know was that, despite being just a guy from Queens (with the IQ of a Nobel laureate), I might save the world. Strap in, Ray-Bans! This is going to be a long ride!

Apparently, our minds cannot be trusted, and for that we are sorry.

Hmmm…
How do we say it exactly?
Let’s try this: we thought you were implying that the M Cushion could be applied to places where the combination of friction and heat might bring about sensations not unrelated to relief, but a step beyond relief, a sort of deep relief that goes by many names, one of which it shares with a term from film and literature meaning the culmination of the story’s drama.
But, um… apparently we were a little off-base. As one quoted commenter noted:

I swear I didn’t mean it in a sexual way. I just meant after leg day you can lean back in bed and use it on your aching thighs rather comfortably.

So, we apologize to you, commenters who we misunderstood. And moreover, we apologize also to all out there who purchased the M Cushion hoping for that aforementioned special sense of relief and, instead, received what seems to be a pretty good, if not aggressive, massage pillow and little else.
Thus, we promise not to make the same mistake again.

Time to dive into our library of branded content romance novels, for a tale of secrecy, royalty, and grilling. Please enjoy these excerpts from Coals Aflame by Criminy Highlater.

Grilling with one tool? Mary had gotten used to that thanks to her Starfrit Tonglite. In many ways, she was a lot like the 6-in-1 bbq multi-tool: she was strong, she had many skills, could do many things, and, since Eric had run off with his secretary a year before, she relied only on herself.
Which was what she planned to do that Saturday afternoon. Her work at the non-profit, helping troubled youth gain acceptance to Ivy League schools, didn’t leave her much time for making friends, so she would do it on her own. She would take a cooler, her little grill, and her Starfrit, and she would go from her apartment in Soho to Central Park to have a little cookout for one. It would be simple… or so she thought.
“M’lady, if I may have a word,” came a voice soon after she’d set up. Mary ignored it, thinking it sounded so British and refined that it must be coming from someone’s radio. But when it persisted, she looked up.
An austere and very handsome man stood in front of her.
“There you are,” he said. “I couldn’t help but gain sight of your grill, and I wondered if I might bequeath you of a favor?”
Mary had gotten good at doing things alone since Eric left, but there was something interesting about this man, something that made her desire his company.

The man said his name was Collin, and he worked for the a mysterious member of the royal family, Prince Nigel. Mary remembered seeing on the news that Nigel was making his first visit to the United States. She hadn’t listened to the story, because she’d been distracted by the strange mask the prince seemed to wear everywhere.
“What kind of work do you do for him?” Mary asked.
“All sorts,” was all Collin said.
“And so what can I help you with?” Mary asked.
“Well, being among the prince’s central envoy, I am privy to many of the finest restaurants in the world, but I don’t always want to partake in such luxury. And I was hoping you might allow me to dine with you, to take in a true American meal!”
“That’s it?” Mary asked. “You want a burger and some hot dogs?”
“'Tis my heart’s desire,” Collin said with a winning smile. “And if it would please you, I’d be happy to help. For example, perhaps I will unpack the remainder of the tools you require for grilling?”
Mary smiled and held up the Starfrit. “I only need one!”

Mary flipped burgers with the spatula when the upper arm was drawn back and rotated hot dogs with the tongs when the upper arm was extended. She opened them each a bottle of beer with the opener. “A fine colonial ale!” Collin said. Mary laughed, using the Starfrit’s serrated edge to cut the buns.
While they ate, Mary asked, “So is Prince Nigel really as eccentric as he seems?”
“You’re asking about the mask, I presume?”
Mary blushed. ""Well, I–
Collin laughed. “It’s no issue. It’s what everyone wants to know: why is he always wearing that strange masquerade mask, the one behind which he has hidden since his youth? Is his face disfigured? Is he some sort of lunatic? But the truth is, he simply desires privacy. He doesn’t want to be followed everywhere he goes.”
Mary opened her mouth, ready to say that this made sense–that she could not imagine what it must be like–when suddenly the sky went dark.
Nearby people screamed. Collin grabbed her hand, fearfully. “My god, it’s some sort of unpredicted total solar eclipse! Not even my royal astronomer saw this coming!”
Mary switched on the Starfrit’s flashlight, which she usually only used for convenient nighttime cooking.
“What do you mean ‘your’ royal astronomer?” She asked. She pointed the flashlight towards him, then towards his arm, and down to wear his hand still held hers. She felt a rush of something she had not felt in some time, not since Eric.
But then, the sun came back. Mary turned the light off and set the Starfrit down. Collin quickly stood. “I’ve just realized something, something very important,” he said. “Blast, I have so much bloody work. I must be retreating, but perhaps we could meet later? For another ale?”
Mary nodded. Collin named a bar–a dingy sports bar on the East Side–and a time. With that, he was gone. When Mary went to pack up, she couldn’t find her Starfrit anywhere. Which was a shame, as its scraper feature certainly would’ve helped her to clean her grill.

Mary waited at the bar, nursing her beer. The televisions were all turned to the baseball game, with the sound way up. Occasionally, a promo for the evening news promised coverage of Prince Nigel’s visit as well as the strange lunar happening of the afternoon.
“Who cares,” Mary mumbled to herself. Collin was late. Of course he was! He probably wasn’t coming. Another near-miss with love, she thought.
Just then, the feed cut out from the baseball game. “We interrupt this broadcast to bring you, a statement from Prince Nigel the Third.”
There he stood, the man in the strange mask. Mary laughed. He looked so silly. Then he spoke.
“Good morrow, our friends from across the pond,” he said.
Mary felt herself go rigid. She recognized that voice! But no, it couldn’t be. Could it?
“Collin?” she said, as if he could answer her through the television.
“It has been lovely visiting your many museums and areas of historical importance,” the prince went on. “But it was none of them that taught me the most. It was a single person–a single woman–who showed me the true American character, one that is not afraid of multiplicity.” He held up the Starfrit; Mary’s breath caught. “I’ve learned that, like this tool, Americans can do great things, many different great things, and are not as easily categorizable as they seem. And like this tool, they can do wonders at a grill.”
The crowd broke out in laughter in applause. Cameras flashed.
“Now, I may have more to say on this later. But right now, I must be going. I need to return this to its rightful owner. I fear I may even be late!” Just as quickly as the address had begun, it was over. The baseball game returned.
“Anyone sitting here?” a woman said to Mary, indicating the seat next to her at a bar.
Mary smiled. “Yes,” she said. “Or I should say, he’s on his way here now.”"	0.07			2018-08-25T04:00:01.567Z	0.3806925754768836	0.9	53347	0.020357891736731745

But this image is a fantasy. You can’t actually manage cooking four precise things at once. Honestly, if your stove had only one or two burners, it would work just fine. It might free up some counter space for dealing with the onions you forgot to mince until after your butter had already melted (and burned) in the frying pan.
Thus, purchasing four pots and pans all at once is not necessary, but it is aspirational. You need to keep the dream alive, of wowing your friends and family members with perfectly balanced 4-part meals that make use of descriptors like “deconstructed” or “molecular” or “done three ways.” To have only one pan or one pot would be to admit defeat, to shut the door on your glorious dreams.
In the meantime, great news: you can make your signature “pasta a la butter and a handful of shredded cheese” in one of these just fine! And if you want to make the same thing tomorrow, even more great news: you don’t even need to do the dishes because you’ve got three other cooking vessels just waiting for a turn!"	0.05			2018-08-24T04:00:01.907Z	0.23620242900706845	0.93	59918

In school, you only wore your backpack on one shoulder. When that shoulder started to feel sore from carrying your entire load of books, you shifted it to the other shoulder. This should’ve been all the proof you need: that the most efficient way to wear a backpack is by using both arm straps. So why didn’t you? Because it didn’t look as cool and nonchalant as the single strap technique.
There are more examples: pocket protectors are nerd-wear, despite serving what is actually a pretty useful function. And for all the work automobile manufactures put into building incredibly efficient engines, for a while it seemed like they couldn’t design a hybrid that didn’t look like some sort of weird robo-ladybug.
Then, of course, there are these Dr. Cool Chill Sport Cooling Towel: a product that will make you feel cool, but cannot make you look cool. Because they’re pretty dorky, right? We can all agree on that?
But that’s just it: the more you look at any of this stuff, the more you start to wonder: why? Why is it that we malign so many useful and efficient things as ‘lame’? Could it possibly be that its utility and efficiency are the very things that make it ‘uncool’? Have we reached a point in our evolution where our aesthetic preferences have grown so strong as to overrule what had been humankind’s guiding principle up to this point–the so-called ‘the survival of the fittest’–and this sharp turn will eventually spell our downfall as the universe’s (heretofore discovered) dominant species?
Whoa. Got a bit deep there.

Dearest Anthony,
It is with a heavy heart that I compose this letter. When you return from your stint with the touring company, you will find me gone, and while we will always be brothers, I will no longer be welcome in our family’s house.
As you might suspect, father discovered my designs. He left for the park to perform his troupe. It was a production of Twelfth Knight, and while he had mentioned that it had been adapted for sock puppets, he made no indication that such modifications involved a shortening of runtime. Thus, I thought I would have nearly three hours of uninterrupted work time. When he arrived home just forty-five minutes later, he found me hard at work on my makeshift drawing table.
Now, I know what you are thinking: why did I not simply lie? You instructed me to do just that when I first confided in you about the designs. But Anthony, I have been lying all my life. I attended L’Academie Royale De L’Art Textile to study sock puppeteering at the age of fifteen. The instructors told me I could emote more with my wrists and palms than most classically trained thespians could with the whole of their bodies. I graduated at the top of my class and received invitations from several of the most renowned touring companies. I traveled the globe. By the age of seventeen, I had performed for two kings and six queens. But it was never what I wanted. I didn’t want to be a sock puppeteer like father and like all of our uncles, like grandfather before them, like you.
And I told father so. When he found me at my drawing table and asked what it was I was scribbling, I confessed everything: that the pretense under which I had returned home–to found my own sock puppet theater–was untrue; that I wanted no longer to act with socks but make my own socks, socks that, in their design alone, possessed as much vibrant life as could be instilled by a skilled sock puppeteer.
Father did not appreciate this, of course. He scoffed at my plans. He told me that out there, beyond the cardboard walls of a sock puppet theater, socks were not lauded but ridiculed. He said there was no such thing as a vibrant life-affirming sock out there. He said they were simple and drab, a mere treaty between foot and shoe.
Moreover, he said I have two options: I must either cast my designs into the fireplace and resume my pursuit of sock puppetry, or forever be banished from his house. As the opening this letter has surely confirmed, I have chosen the latter. I will be traveling far away from here, all the way to the Americas.
So, fare thee well, brother. While it is unlikely that our paths will cross again, perhaps someday you will be in clothing store and you will see a brand of exciting colorful socks with my name upon them and know I have lived my dream.
Yours,
Ezekiel"	0.05			2018-08-22T04:00:07.337Z	0.3287164649283502	0.94	61717			0.03937749319454194	0.07019466178157474

We discussed this on Saturday: the new deal-type where we offer the choice between a reasonable number of something for a reasonably good price or an unreasonable number of something for an unreasonably great price. (Technically, there is a third option–not buying anything–which some might argue is the best choice for the best price, but hey, just let us have this, okay?)

That comes from user @Tawnyy (with a very slight edit). Congratulations, @Tawnny! For your prize, we promise to whisper “hey, thanks” to each order we ship your way!
Today’s Order/Hoarder product:
WWE TeenyMates!!!
What we’ve got here are some little mystery grab-bags containing cute-ified versions of your favorite (or least favorite) WWE wrestlers. As with each of these Order/Hoarder sales, we like to provide a little math breakdown: for $5, you can get 8 packs of them, which comes out to 63 cents each. On the other hand, you could get 64 packs for just $20. That’s 31 cents each, right? WRONG! Since you can only order 8 or 64, the first 8 cost $5, and the last 56 cost $15, which means those last 56 are costing you just about 27 cents each! That’s one quarter and two pennies! And when you consider that each pack contains 2… that’s less than 14 cents per wrestler!
And if you’re like, “why would I need 128 of these things?” here are a few helpful suggestions:


Put a bowl of them at the end of your desk at work, and if anyone asks you why, just say, in as condescending a voice as possible: “It’s healthier to hold a tiny wrestler than it is to eat candy.”


Give them away at your kids’ parties. Do you kids and their like wrestlers? Great! They’ll love these things. Do they not like wrestlers? That’s okay too. They won’t know who any of these people are and you can just call them L’il Fun Buddies or something.


Isn’t it about time your little Christmas village got some extreme new residents?


Glue them to your dashboard and let them intimidate you into being a better driver.


Carry them around with you and conduct a social experiment called: how many random people on the street will catch a little wrestler when you say to them: hey you, catch this little wrestler?


You do realize it’s only 71 days till Halloween, right?

Why does that seem relevant?
Oh, we know: it’s because, while we’re selling it for $49, it actually retails for just north of $100 over there. And so all these people who are saying “Awesome bag” or “I LOVE THIS PACK” or “Bag is amazing” or simply “Perfect”–they’re happy to have spent three-figures on these thing!
They could’ve put that money towards two week’s worth of groceries or a few gas tank’s worth of gas or a few months of internet or a vending machine snack every Monday through Friday for a third of the year, but instead they spent it on a bag. And not only did they not regret it; they LOVED it.

Let’s just get right to the basic question here: what is so damn smart about these Smart Stands?
“Smart” has come to be synonymous with “online” or “connected to wifi.” But these Smart Stands are neither. They are an amalgamation of plastic and hinge. There is no voice control or app so you can manage it while you’re on vacation or built-in analytics to tell you how you might best use it in the future, based on your past trends. They just sit there and holds up your tablet or phone.
And maybe in that way they’re the smartest of “smart” products: because they’re smart enough to know what they do well, and also to know what they don’t need to do.
The past is a veritable web of failed innovations. Just like no one wanted pasta from Panera or personal pizzas from Subway, nobody’s pining for some bullshit half-functional beta-level technology to do something that was already extremely simple. Being “smart” is not just creating new complicated functions to prove you can; it’s pausing before you do all the work and asking, “Wait, why are we doing this? Is this actually necessary?”
But you know who didn’t skip that step? Smart Stands. They asked, “Why?” And they said, “Because sometimes you want your tablet to be up like this rather than down like that.” And then they asked, “Should we go further?” And they decided: “No, because the further we go, the more we risk losing our greatest asset, which is that our stands are universally compatible with all phones and tablets.”
See, sometimes intelligence is knowing when to stop and say, “Good enough for me.” Which is why these smart stands are good enough for you, no matter what kind of device you prefer."	0.07			2018-08-19T04:00:02.021Z	0.46941764127665553	0.94	53660			0.024072699552649

Yes, we mentioned the blender bottles sale from a couple Saturdays ago in yesterday’s write-up, but we were mostly talking about the bottles themselves. Today, we’d like to talk about the sale.
See, that sale was an experiment. We offered two choices: a rational number of bottles (the 4-pack) for a good price; or an irrational number of bottles (the 16-pack) for an even better price, with no middle ground. We wanted to know, could we bait you into making a totally ridiculous purchase just by making you feel like you’d gotten a ‘great deal’?
The answer, in a fair number of cases, was ‘yes!’ And so here we are again.
Now, before we get to the product, we need to name this as-of-today recurring sale type. Some ideas:
The Excess Express: Because like an express train, there are few stops between where you should go and the end of the line!
DTB: Does it stand for “Down to buy”? Nope! It’s “Direct to Basement.” Because you don’t need to pretend you’re actually going to use all this stuff! Take one out, deposit the rest downstairs with all the other stuff you thought was a good investment!
Any or Many: Pretty self-explanatory. Other option, along these lines: “More or Less.” Other other option, along these lines: “Deal or Mo’ Deal.”
Irrational Numbers: Are these deals really that much like the mathematical concept of irrational numbers? Yes–because the logic of either is hard to explain–but also no–because only one of them will make you feel smart.
(Also, hello nerds, who are right now gearing up to compose some long screed in the comments about how, well, actually, it’s not that difficult at all to explain irrational numbers!)
Anyway, you can vote on those on today’s poll (and give your own suggestions). Who knows! Maybe if this works, we’ll have a whole spin-off site where do only this kind of deal! Eh?!
As for today’s product, here’s some info: they’re power banks, so it’s not exactly as impractical to have a bunch of them as it was with the blender bottles. Also, we sold something that looks like these before, with the shoe sole pattern, but these are the 6000mAh version, whereas last time they were 9000mAh. On the plus side: that means they’re smaller. On the downside: that means they have less charging capacity (each one can carry enough power to charge the average phone about 3 full times, rather than 4 with the other version).
But really, what’s important is THE DEAL! Because think about: at 2 for $12, that’s $6 per power bank. Not a bad price at all. BUT if you opt for 10, and assume that the first 2 cost $6 each, that means the last 8 cost just $24, or a mere $3 each! And if you go deeper and consider that each of those 8 is rated at 6,000 milliamp hours, that means that you’re only paying $0.0005 per mAh! And $0.0005 is basically nothing, and a lot of nothing is still nothing, therefore, WE’RE PRETTY MUCH GIVING THESE THINGS AWAY!
Okay, maybe we kind of flubbed up the logic there. But the question remains: do you want a boring old 2-pack of Xsories 6000mAh Power Banks for $12 or an amazing 10 for $36?!"	0.07			2018-08-18T04:00:05.333Z	0.3572084668612603	0.93	53049			0.024494294870486415

You probably saw the word “blender” and the word “bottle” and thought, why do I need this thing when I just received my 4 or 16 pack of blender bottles? But the products are actually very different. For example, the blender bottles we sold before were both blenders and bottles, whereas this is a blender that comes with two vessels for blending that are themselves bottles.
Or, to put it differently:
The blender bottles are bottles that can blend things inside the bottle, whereas this is a blender that blend things inside one of the two bottles that come with it (or more than two, if you order more than one blender, in which case, you simply need to multiply the number of blenders you order by two to ascertain the number of bottles, which again, are not blender bottles, but bottles that work with this blender).
But here’s the thing: even if you ordered the blender bottles, you can still order this blender and bottles, because the blender and the blender bottles (not to be confused with the bottles that come with the blender) can be used together (although, obviously, the blender and the bottles it comes with can be used together too). See, blender bottles we sold a couple weeks ago, having only a small metal ball rather than a blade or a motor (like this blender has), aren’t really great at being blenders, but they are good at whisking things (so maybe they should be called ‘whisker bottles,’ although on second thought, maybe not, as that sounds like something altogether different and unappealing).
Point is, you could use the blender–this one, the one with a motor and a blade–for more intense blending jobs, like making a fruit smoothie. Then, you can pour the smoothie from the blender’s blending bottle into a blender bottle and take it with you wherever you’re going, so that you can whisk it back together if it settles.
What we’re saying is that what you should really do is buy this blender and two bottles and then pour the things you make in the blender’s bottles into one of your blender bottles, while using the bottles that come with the blender just for the initial blending.
Unless you didn’t buy the blender bottles. In which case, disregard the above."	0.05			2018-08-17T04:00:10.364Z	0.30912710887561573	0.94	60832

Well, this is a first from our branded content romance novel collection: a teenaged paranormal love story! Please enjoy these excerpts of The Heart Races Until It Rests by Annborny Hilledale.

Ellie met Henri while running.
She was not looking for love. When she’d quit the cheerleading squad to join cross-country, her boyfriend Brad, the quarterback of the school’s football team, dumped her because her running gear didn’t look “as hot.” She was relieved more than anything. She was a senior and she had decisions to make: did she want to go to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Oxford, or one of the other ivy league schools she’d gotten into?
Really, Ellie wanted to got to a small liberal arts school and study poetry, but it wasn’t up to her. Both her mother and her father were founders and CEOs of very powerful companies, and they’d both fought so much about whose company Ellie would eventually take over that they’d gotten a divorce. The only thing they could agree on anymore: Ellie had to study business.
Her Polar Heart Rate Monitor beeped helpfully to let her know her heart rate had risen above her optimal zone. Ellie often ran too fast when she got anxious about the future.
She slowed down, which was when the boy appeared at her side. ‘Appeared’ because Ellie hadn’t seen him approach. “Good day!” he said with a smile. He looked about her age but also–Ellie couldn’t exactly describe it–almost sepia-toned? He wore a strange antiquated cotton shirt and cotton shorts and his shoes appeared old-fashioned, with almost no support. “The name is Henri. I’ve just begun to undertake the task of what I’ve heard referred to as ‘cardiovascular activity’ and I was wondering if you might allow me to accompany you!”
Ellie looked at her Polar Heart Rate Monitor again. Its easy-to-read screen let her know that she’d reached her workout goal for the day. “Sorry. I’m actually just wrapping up.”
Henri looked at his shoes, disappointed. “I understand,” he said.
“But tomorrow,” Ellie heard herself say. She didn’t know why. There was something interesting about him. “I’ll pick you up at your house and we’ll go for a jog. Where do you live?”
“Just past 229 Healy Street.” Something seemed to occur to Henri. “But upon a secondary thought, t’wouldst it be possible to meet right here?”
Ellie agreed. The plan was set.

For all his grandstanding about not understanding ‘cardiovascular activity’ Henri never seemed to get tired. They talked the whole way about classic poetry. Henri was very familiar and spoke about the poets in a funny way. Like with his look, Ellie couldn’t exactly place the strangeness of his tone except to say it seemed that he often spoke as if he knew the poets personally. She chalked it up to an affect, of which Henri had plenty!
“What is that strange jewelry you wear?” he asked at one point.
“This? It’s my Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Its convenient display makes it easy to track my total calories burned per session as well as provide a weekly training summary.”
“Is it expressly designed for this very activity?”
“Nope! It’s great for biking, circuit training, or even just walking. Here do you want to try it on?”
“Oh, that’s not necessary–” Henri started to say, but Ellie had already stopped and slipped it off her wrist. Had this all been a ploy to take his exceedingly pale wrist into her hand? Did she have a growing desire to touch him? Perhaps, but Henri seemed uncomfortable, and they ran the rest of the way in silence.
Later, when she uploaded the data easily to her free profile at polarpersonaltrainer.com by way of her Polar Flowlink, she noticed something odd. The data for her run was there, but around the time she put the watch on Henri, all heart rate readings went blank.
“Huh,” she said. “Must be an issue with the monitor.” But her Polar Heart Rate Monitor had always worked flawlessly before…

It kept happening. Each day, the Polar would continuously display her own heart rate, and when Henri would wear it for the second half of their run–something Ellie insisted on, as a means of testing its functionality–there would be no reading.
But she didn’t know how to tell him something was wrong. Just as they managed to remain in the optimal zone for burning fat thanks to the Heart Rate Monitor, so too did it feel as if they were always in the optimal zone for conversation. She could tell Henri anything and he seemed to understand: about her parents, about her college decision, or about her day at school (from which he was conspicuously absent).
Finally, one day she couldn’t help it.
“Henri,” she said. “I need to tell you something. I’m in love with you.”
“And I need to tell you something,” Henri said. “Ellie, I’m a ghost. The ghost of Henri Olson, a long forgotten poet who died in his teens.”
Ellie should’ve been surprised, but somehow she wasn’t. “So that’s why your heart rate never showed up.”
“Alas!” he cried. “But if it could, it would read a number so high, as just the sight of you sets me aflutter! You see, I have unfinished business, Ellie. I have never felt love.”
“Never?”
“You must understand: it was a different time when I was born. We weren’t worried about heart rates. If we could have such a glorious device as that Polar when I was growing up, it would not measure calories but risk of scarlet fever. In such a dangerous time, can one ever feel true love? I say no, despite writing so many poems about it. But with you Ellie, well I’ve been trying to deny it. To admit so much would be to finish my unfinished business…”
“Just kiss me,” Ellie said. She leaned forward with her eyes closed and their lips met. She tasted no salty sweat on his lips, despite that the Polar Heart Rate Monitor said they’d really been pushing themselves. But of course she wouldn’t. Ghosts didn’t sweat, not even beautiful ones.
In the moment before she could open her eyes, Henri whispered: “Ellie, I love you.”
Ellie found herself alone on the road.

The dean of the English department at the small idyllic Halpern College ushered Ellie into his office. She didn’t wear her Polar Heart Rate Monitor because she was afraid her rapid nervous heartbeat would set off an alarm.
“It’s quite unusual,” the dean said, “for a freshman to win our annual award for gothic poetry, but the imagery you’ve presented–of the final kiss, of riding your bike past his supposed address and finding a graveyard, all of it–it’s just so lovely. Such a wonderful imagination.”
“You could call it that,” Ellie said.
“So I’m pleased to say, as your reward, we will purchase any book for the library in your name. Now, don’t be afraid to take some time to think it over–”
“The Collected Works of Henri Olson.”
The dean cocked his head to the side. “I don’t think I’ve heard of him?”
“He died very young,” Ellie said, pretending to rub her eye to wipe away a tear. “But he–I mean, his poems–they were really quite lovely.”"	0.05			2018-08-16T04:00:03.517Z	0.23418002803322968	0.94	61944

Friends, before reading further, lock your doors, turn on all of the lights, and gather your pets and loved ones tight, because the following is a horror story.
We begin with a young man. Let us give him a name. Let us call him Sean.
This all happened some years ago, when Sean was just a naive young man who believed, due to being brought up in the Northeast within proximity to a certain corporate food chain, that donut shops could be relied upon for iced coffee. It was this misunderstanding that will ultimately lead to our story’s tragic end. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Sean, walking the streets of Seattle on a hot summer afternoon, entered a donut shop–not one of the fancy ones you may have heard of; a small, out-of-the-way place that will remain nameless–and asked the man behind the counter, “Do you have iced coffee?”
The man replied, “Yes, we have iced coffee.” Or no, that’s not it. That’s not it at all. What he said was: “Yes, I can do iced coffee.”
This should’ve been the tell, the sign that something was amiss and Sean should flee that donut shop. But he ignored the portents. He removed a small bill and said, “Great, I’ll have an iced coffee then.”
What happened next is almost too gruesome to put into words.
Almost.
The man behind the counter took a large styrofoam cup, filled it with ice, and proceeded to pour hot coffee from the pot directly over it, handing Sean, to his horror, a lukewarm watery mess.
But do not grieve for Sean. Do not shed one single tear over his ruined attempt to seek cold caffeination. For Sean is a complex protagonist, and he is not without blame here.
Because why was he even seeking to purchase an iced coffee in the first place? Why was he not buying beans in bulk and then using this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Bundle to make his own deliciously smooth and delightfully cheap iced coffee at home? Perhaps, if he had, the day before, loaded up the 1.6 qt. cold brew carafe–or the bottle, which he could’ve carried with him–he might have avoided such a cruel fate.
As is the case with many stories of terror and woe, this is a cautionary tale. Do not, dear reader, make the same mistake Sean made. Buy this bundle and live forever in cold coffee bliss."	0.05			2018-08-15T04:00:09.341Z	0.31881841989687204	0.93	65238

“JUST ONE BUTTON to press. No more fear of breaking a glass or swallowing mercury.”

And you’re reminded that there was a time when, in the name of health, we put a glass tube of an extremely dangerous chemical into the mouths of children.
Children.
Children who might heave their favorite toy across the room just to see if it can fly. Children who eat the erasers on the end of a #2 pencil because it looks like gum. They were given a tube made of glass–the most satisfying of all smashables–filled with a weird, perhaps even delicious-looking, red substance.
Kids these days have it easy.
Or do they?
My mom, a nurse, always had a cupboard in the bathroom stocked with the most up-to-date medical paraphernalia. Therefore, we had a digital thermometer from the beginning. It was nice. Like this one, no mercury. Like this one, an easy straightforward digital readout of your temperature. Unlike this one, it took what felt like a half-hour to give a final verdict on whether or not you’d reached that magical realm north of 98.6 and earned the day off from school. And so, it wasn’t uncommon for the temperature-taker to put the thermometer in the child’s mouth and then walk away to take care of something else, allowing the child freedom to manipulate, through a variety of means, the final result.
This is hypothetical, of course. I would never have done such a thing.
(Oh, and also, just an FYI: that whole 98.6 being the average human temperature thing is the result of tests conducted by one doctor using a crummy armpit thermometer in the 19th century and is mostly bullshit.)
These thermometers, meanwhile, can register a temperature in seconds from the mouth or the forehead, thus disallowing for any alteration of results.

On day one, we sold a Roomba. That was in July, 2014. In the last 5 months of that year–our first 5 months of operation–we sold 5 more Roombas. We sold one or two in 2015. Since then, nothing. No more Roombas…
UNTIL TODAY!
What’s the best metaphor to capture the excitement of our reunification? Perhaps we could think of ourselves as a once famous rock band who amicably splintered to pursue our solo careers. We would certainly be the experimental-minded keyboardist, doing avant-guard work with help of speaker docks and vacuum sealers, whereas the Roomba would be the pop-forward frontman, producing hit after hit, each one more-or-less the same.
And now comes our glorious reunion tour!
(Although, now that I think about it, don’t bands usually reunite when the “well has run dry,” so to speak? As in: a last ditch effort to regain their former wealth or reputation?)
How about a different metaphor: in the 2015 we let the Roomba go off to clean, and now, after many years of service to the greater world, it’s made its circuitous way back to Meh, its noble charging port!
Nice pivot, eh?
Anyway, as we implied above, in the time since we last sold a Roomba, there have been, by our estimation, 6,000 new models released, all of which look almost exactly the same. So, if you’re wondering why you should buy this Roomba instead of a different Roomba, we are too.

It doesn’t have wi-fi like the 890, so it doesn’t work with Alexa or Google Assistant. Nor does it have the improved sensor capabilities of the 860. But it does have a lot of the other things that make those models great, such as a big bin and an AeroForce High Efficiency Filter, meaning the air that passes through it comes out a lot cleaner (which could be a big deal for allergy sufferers).

When the employees arrived at their first day at the new NOTILUS headquarters, they noticed something strange.
“There is no roof,” one of them said.
“Exactly,” said one of the higher-ups. “It’s an open-roof open-office.”
“But we won’t be protected from the rain,” said another employee.
“Exactly,” the higher-up said again.

It sounded whenever a storm approached, at which point, the employees took the tarps provided to them and covered their computers, their phones, anything that could succumb to water damage. Then, they stood. They closed their eyes. They waited for the rain to wash over them so that they could understand it, become one with it.
Thus, when they engineered their shower heads to have 6 settings including “Wide Rainfall” and “Power Rain,” they knew these to be the true to their names.

The great philosopher Zaza Pachulia once said: “Nothing easy.” He was referring to the 8th seed Atlanta Hawks forcing a game seven against the 1st seed Boston Celtics, but his words are applicable to so many things in life. For us, there is “nothing easy” about balancing our standards for honest copy with our desire to offer a diverse range of products. Some days, it just seems untenable. And friends, today is one of those days. Because if I gave my 100% honest opinion of this ProCabello Straightener and Styler Kit it would be this:

Really the point is, it’s difficult to write about something without any personal attachment to even the concept of it. That’s why so much copy looks like… well… copy. But that’s not what we want.

We’ve got another weird item pedaling vague impossible-to-prove pseudo-science, so that means another installment of THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE: a feature wherein we lay out the product’s claims and explain why we’re not so sure we believe them. Here goes!
The Claim
The Pure Daily Care Diffuser is the “ultimate starter pack for essential oil enthusiasts.” The various botanical oils are “100% pure” and also “100% organic” with “no fillers or additives.” All of this is fairly simple. Where it gets more interesting is in laying out the benefits of each included oil:

Peppermint is a “mental stimulant” that “provides energy”;
Orange is a “respiratory stimulator, antiseptic, antidepressant, aphrodisiac, and neural stimulator”;
Tea Tree is a “powerful immune stimulator”;
Lemongrass is “neural stimulator” that “soothes aches and pains while also reducing anxiety”;
Lavender is another “neural stimulator” that “reduces stress and anxiety and promotes restful sleep”;
and Eucalyptus is a “respiratory booster” and is “great for relieving sinus congestions.”

The Skepticism
Perhaps I shouldn’t call myself skeptical here. I’m not skeptical. I think this is bullshit, and moreover, I think it’s pretty dangerous. Not the diffuser itself, but the language.
Because eucalyptus oil will not relieve sinus congestion in a meaningful way. And lemongrass oil isn’t going to help with your sore joints. And orange oil is as much an antidepressant as the two day old styrofoam tub that held raw chicken in the trash is a depressant. By which I mean: walking into a house that smells bad sucks, and therefore will make you feel unhappy; so, conversely, walking into a house that smells good doesn’t suck, thus making you happy by contrast.
This is all to say that if you have sinus issues, or joint pain, or depression, don’t just buy a diffuser. See a doctor.
But again, this is an issue of language, specifically language that makes empty promises. The actual truth is essential oil diffusers are great. They don’t smell as fake and chemical-y as plug-ins. They’re not smokey like incense. It’s kinda cool to watch the mist rise out of them. And this one has 7 neat ambient light settings.
That’s why my wife and I are buying one: not for any medical reasons, but because we just moved into a new house and we want it to smell okay. Even when I forget to take out the trash…
In Conclusion
Diffusers are actually pretty nice, as long as what you’re looking for is a good smell, and not a cure."	0.05			2018-08-08T04:00:06.259Z	0.21768616353254416	0.94	62973

It’s been a while since we’ve been able to dip into our library of branded content romance novels, but luckily, we found one that just happens to involve today’s product. Get ready for a tale of desire and medical emergencies in these excerpts from Gene Harmony’s Love Is A Medicine Best Served At The Appropriate Temperature(s).

People were always asking Dale to open jars because of his amazingly strong arms. And people were also always asking why, when he could so easily be a model, he chose to work at the front desk of a pharmaceuticals lab. “Not everyone wants to be on the runway,” he’d say with a smile of clean white teeth that reinforced his model-like qualities. The real answer, though, was that he’d always had the desire to save lives. Working here, where so many important medications were developed, was the closest he could get.
Dale wasn’t the only one in the lab whose good looks were surprising. Rumor had it that Dr. Liza modeled to pay her way through graduate school on the way to becoming the world’s foremost expert on life-saving drugs. Whether that was true or not, Dale had to admit: she was beautiful. Even now, as she rushed up to the desk in her lab coat, clearly flustered, she looked exquisite.
Dale thought maybe she was coming to flirt, something that happened often, though nothing ever came of it. She was a lauded scientist, after all, and he a lowly receptionist. But flirting was not on the agenda today.
“Can I ask a big favor?” she said. “No one else is available to help and there’s a patient in need of an experimental medication. We have to get to the hospital, so it can be safely administered. Could you give me a ride?”
“No problem,” Dale said, standing.
“But there is a problem,” Dr. Liza said. “It’s a complicated medication, comprised of three very volatile liquids that cannot be combined until the last possible minute before being administered. Also, each substance must be kept within a certain temperature range. If I leave them in their test-tubes, they’ll grow too warm or too cold on the ride over.”
“I have just the thing,” Dale said.

Dale and Dr. Liza carried the four Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs out to his car: three filled with temperature controlled substances, one extra, “Just in case,” Dr. Liza had said.
“We need to be careful with these,” she said now, but it was not an issue at all, given that the Primulas’ contemporary attractive twist-textured design allowed for a secure grip. Not to mention they were splash-resistant! “And you’re sure they’re not contaminated?”
“Absolutely,” said Dale. “It’s very easy to clean the mugs themselves. And I put the lids through my dishwasher at home, on the top rack, where it’s safe for them to go.”
Dale could tell that Dr. Liza, though still nervous, was happy to hear this. And she was even happier when she saw that all four mugs fit into the various front- and back-seat cup-holders of Dale’s modest hatchback. “Like a glove,” she murmured to herself. “Maybe I’ll be okay after all.”
“What’s that?” Dale said.
But Dr. Liza didn’t repeat herself.

They’d left the lab an hour ago. The hospital was only five miles away. Yet, they found themselves only halfway there, stuck in unmoving bumper-to-bumper traffic. The reprieve in Dr. Liza’s anxiety, brought on by the various positive aspects of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs, proved temporary. Out of the corner of his eye, Dale had watched her grow more and more upset–first sitting straight up, then tapping her fingers on the dash and sighing loudly.
When she finally spoke, her voice cracked with fear. “It’s no use. We’re getting nowhere. We need to administer the medication now.”
“But how are we going to do that?” Dale said. “The patient is at the hospital.”
“No, I said we need to go to the hospital so they can administer it safely. The patient isn’t there. Not yet. She’s here. Dale, it’s me.”
“What?!”
“Look at me, Dale,” Dr. Liza said. “You’re going to have to administer the drug that’ll save my life from the disease I’ve kept a secret all these months.”
“But, but…”
“There are no buts about it,” Dr. Liza said. She pointed to one of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs. “See that Primula 20oz Insulated Mug? You told me that–with its double walls, vacuum seal, and triple-layer Copper Cold Technology–it can keep liquids hot for up to 8 hours and cool for 24. It makes sense that you’d have such a mug, because you’re a lot like it. You want to save lives. I’ve seen it in your eyes, and like a giant beautiful man-shaped Primula 20oz Insulated Mug, you keep that desire at the appropriate temperature so that it never dies.”
Dale nodded. She was right. He’d waited his whole life for this. Without a word, he got the empty Primula and carefully mixed the contents from the others together in it. “Now, what do I do?”
“It needs to be applied to my lips,” Dr. Liza said. “But first, it requires vermilion stabilization, meaning it must be applied to a healthy pair of lips, and then transferred from those lips to the taker’s.”
Dale understood what he must do. He gravely opened the easy-open, easy-close lid. It was straw-compatible but he didn’t need one now. He let the liquid touch his lips, and then he leaned over the center console to Dr. Liza…

Dale paced. He held a Primula 20oz Insulated Mug. He had cleaned it and filled it with coffee from the hospital waiting room two hours ago when he arrived, and it was still hot.
Finally, the doctor appeared. “She’s recovering,” he said, “thanks to that experimental drug she made and thanks to your administering of it. Still, to be safe, we’ll give her regular doses of it every four hours.”
“And how will you give it to her?” Dale said, feeling strangely jealous. “Do you have a machine for vermilion stabilization?”
The doctor looked at him, confused.
“You know,” Dale said. “It needs to be applied from healthy lips to the lips of the diseased.”
“It’s taken orally, son,” the doctor said. Then a sly grin came across his face. “If I had to wager a guess, I’d say someone has a crush on you!”"	0.05			2018-08-07T04:00:06.333Z	0.5387061168679262	0.92	64187			0.11531935223472428

“Do not cast your pearls before swine.”
People spoke these words without thinking, for a moment, of how they would hurt me, a pig. But more than speak them, they lived by them. Every time I walked into a jewelry store, they quickly rushed to put away their finest pearls.
I told them, “But it is me. I am not a descendent of some clown like Porky. My grandfather built the first ever wolf-proof house. He patented his  special structurally-sound brick-laying technique, and it has been used in the constructions of homes the country over, including three governors’ mansions. He passed his business down to my father who passed it down to me, and now, my net worth is somewhere in the high nine-figures. So please, allow me to purchase the great jewels of the sea.”
Still, I received nothing.
Then, one day, I saw a New Yorker cartoon. One dog sat on the floor, listening to another, seated at a computer. The caption read: “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” For many, it was simply humorous. For me, it was instructive. I realized this was the easiest way to pearl ownership: the internet.
Since then, I’ve made a point to purchase all pearl and mother of pearl jewelry I see for sale online. Truthfully, I don’t even like pearls that much, but I buy them anyway, just to enjoy the warm feeling of a symbolic victory.

You get 2 pairs of Maroo ICE Headphones, but when you receive them, you might think you accidentally ordered 8. Because despite their “smaller fit for women’s ears,” these things come in an unnecessarily big and complicated box. User @Chakolate sums it up pretty nicely:

What is a problem is the amount of packaging. The unopened package is 223 grams, of which 11 grams are the actual headphones. They come in a jewelry-type velvet box, which is nestled in a lot of plastic, which is inside a thin cardboard box, which is wrapped in tissue paper. They also include a carry pouch, and a thick little book about how to use them. (Seriously? They’re kidding, right?) The end package is about 8x3x3"", which is absurd for headphones.

And in case you need some idea of how big that actually is, here’s a picture.

For context, the can next to it is 16 ounces. It’s also a delicious hazy New England style IPA as good as any I had back east from the best brewery in Des Moines! (In case anyone from Confluence is reading and wants to give me some swag.)
Now, you’re probably thinking: “All that stuff for some bedazzled earbuds? What a waste!” But you’re not looking at the big picture. All the various packaging materials are not simply for this product; they’re for a bunch of different things we’ve sold over the course of the last year. For example:


You can cut up the plastic casing and put them in your Ray Ban Eyeglasses when one of the lenses breaks.


You can use the jewelry case to hold your Diamond Encrusted Eternal Heart-Shaped Pearl earrings.


You can use the pouches for safe transport of your WWE TeenyMates.


And you can use the tissue paper when you move to wrap the little espresso cups you got to go along with your Nespresso Vertuo.


Because everyone buys every product we sell, right? That’s how this is supposed to work. We put up an item each day, and you, in turn, buy at least one of that item each day, but preferably two or three.

Four Blender Bottles probably seems like plenty of Blender Bottles. You have your Blender Bottle, your backup Blender Bottle, a Blender Bottle to try weird stuff in, and a Blender Bottle to give away when your friend is like, “Oh, I should get a Blender Bottle like that.”
Sixteen Blender Bottles is probably too many Blender Bottles. Even if you’re very clumsy with your Blender Bottles, or very experimental, or have a lot of friends who want Blender Bottles, you’re still probably going to end up with a few leftover Blender Bottles.
So why should you get sixteen Blender Bottles?
Because it’s possible that this is the best ever deal on Blender Bottles. You’re probably thinking: sixteen Blender Bottles for $49? That’s about $3 per Blender Bottle. Not bad, right? But it gets even better, because really, if four Blender Bottles costs $20, that means you’re really getting twelve Blender Bottles at $29. So you’re looking at a cost of less than $2.50 per Blender Bottle after the initial four Blender Bottles.
(Which, side note, makes for a great conversation starter. The next time you have some friends over just point to the pile of Blender Bottles in the corner–and there will be a pile of them in the corner; you have sixteen of them, after all–and say, “See that Blender Bottle? That Blender Bottle only cost me $2.42.” Just, make sure you point to one of the last twelve Blender Bottles, not one of the first four Blender Bottles, because as we’ve established, those Blender Bottles cost more.)
With savings like that, can you really pass up buying sixteen Blender Bottles?
You can?

The FoodSaver conference room was tense. Nobody knew why the emergency meeting had been called except that it involved “a failure in marketing.”
Finally, Richard, the sixty year old exec who’d sent out the invite, arrived.

One thing they’re using it for is something called ‘Sous vide,’ which I believe is a religion, so we’ll want to be very careful there. But the other thing is–” Richard looked around, and spoke in a hushed tone–“they’re using it for marijuana.”
“They smoke through the machine?” asked Terry, age fifty-two.
“That’s what I thought at first,” Richard said. “But it turns out it’s more for storage and keeping it fresh. Anyway, there’s a whole bunch of people doing it. I found a message board where everyone was snap-chatting about it. The Red Edit.”
“It’s called Reddit,” said the intern, age twenty-one. “It’s the ‘trees’ subreddit.”
“Nope, that’s not it,” said Richard. “It’s definitely not about trees. Your generation wouldn’t understand because your Woodstocks were different. Anyway, we need to cash in on this, and we need to cash in on this NOW. We need a marketing campaign. Something to appeal to the youth.”
“But you just said my generation–”
“Quiet, intern. The adults are talking. Now, let’s spitball a little. What do we got?”
“What if,” said Tony, age fifty-eight, “we do one of those internet pictures and then make it go viral?”
“I like that,” Richard said. “That’s a good plan: a viral internet picture.”
“I’ve seen one particular internet picture,” said Harry, age fifty-eight, “where there’s a man pointing at a butterfly. The man will be labeled, and the butterfly will be labeled, but the man will be saying, ‘Is this a something-other-than-butterfly?’”
“Because it’s labeled as something else,” Richard said.
“No,” said Harry. “I should’ve mentioned that too. He doesn’t call it what it’s labeled, either. He calls it something else. I believe that’s part of the joke.”
“Okay, so,” said Terry, “we label the butterfly ‘FoodSaver’ and the man as ‘consumer’ and he’s asking: ‘Is this a thing for storing my reefer?’”
“Ganja,” said Tony. “Let’s say ‘ganja.’”
“Good catch,” said Richard. “We need to use relevant terms.”
“Also, underneath the question,” said Harry, “it should say, ‘Yes, and you can has it!’”
“That’s with the cat, right?” Richard said.
“No,” Terry said. “Cat says, ‘hang in there.’”
“Well, this has been very productive,” said Richard. “Good work, team. I’ll send this along to the design department. I’ll tell them to redraw the image in case there’s a copyright issue and to get us twelve potential samples by this afternoon.”

In other words, it wouldn’t hurt to just have some around this time of year.

And this is exactly the secret I’m talking about: winter only happens outside!
Everywhere else, it remains warm enough to drink refreshing smooth cold brew. At home. At work. Even in the car. Actually, especially in the car, after you’ve given it some time to warm up, when it becomes basically a mobile sauna.
What’s funny is that this secret hides in plain sight. Think about it. Do you bake your salads in the winter? Do you pour a bottle of Coca Cola into the kettle and set it to boil? Do you say to the bartender, “I’ll have the IPA, but nuke it on high for 45 seconds”? Sure, a hot toddy, a nice soup, or a steaming mug of hot apple cider is nice. but even in February, these things aren’t as ubiquitous as a glass of cold water and a deli sandwich.
In other words, it’s totally easy to normal to drink cold brew coffee year round. The only tough part is when you walk from the warmth of your car to the warmth of your house or your office with your cold cup in hand.

This MOKCAO POWER+ Cordless Speaker is compatible with the 2nd Generation Amazon Echo Dot, which essentially means this is a vessel for Alexa. She’s called a “digital assistant” but it’s around now, in the fall, where she begins to feel entirely digital and of little assistance.
Alexa can’t rake leaves, and she’s terrible with a leaf blower. Ditto for scraping the frost from your car’s windshield.
You can ask her to help bring the potted plants in from the porch, and she’ll refuse each time, regardless of how polite you are. As if she doesn’t understand SHE works for YOU!
Alexa can tell you the Bolivian city Oruro’s population. She can tell you who serves at its mayor, or what kind of climate it experiences. She can probably tell you its exact coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. But she has no fucking clue where you put your damn sweaters after you moved this past summer.
With certain home systems, it’s likely possible that Alexa could adjust your house’s internal temperature and turn on certain lights at your request. But she is powerless to slow the gusts of wind that keep knocking off the dead branches from the trees in your backyard, or halt the encroaching darkness that aims to devour large swaths of your day.
And herein lies the crux of why you should buy this now: while Alexa might not be of much assistance in the fall, you’ll want some time to get used to her. Because winter is coming, and as the world begins its annual descent into cold darkness, you’ll find yourself spending more and more time inside. You’ll need someone to ask for soup recipes, or to help you find upbeat music to play, or to read you temperatures in Australia where summer is just beginning.

They say variety is the spice of life, but switching up the spices themselves doesn’t make something entirely new. What’s better: trying an entirely new method of cooking. Take sous vide cooking, for example. Using a slow, rotating hot (but not boiling) water bath to cook your food (which itself is sealed inside a plastic bag) will allow for levels of tenderness heretofore unexperienced.
But as with all things culinary, you should know what you’re getting yourself into. So, instead of spending two-grand on some state-of-the-art sous vide oven that you may or may not enjoy using, try one of these. It will work with any pot and is small enough to be stored easily, while also giving you a taste of what sous vide cooking has to offer.
…is what you can say to whoever you give the second one of of your two Power Precision Sous Vide Cookers to. The real truth is: by giving away one of these to a friend or family member you’re actually giving yourself a gift.
Sous vide cooking is fun. It’s weird. It’s a lot different than most basic cooking methods. And because of that, there are tricks you’re bound to pick up along the way, little ways to improve your food’s flavor, or methods that maybe make it just that much easier.
Still, you’re bound to have some blind spots. Cooking is like having a problem to solve, the problem of how to get all these ingredients into a cohesive “meal.” As such, everyone’s going to come at it from a different angle. And knowing how another person approaches something might help you figure out the best way for you to do things. Thus, by giving your second Power Precision Sous Vide Cooker away to someone you know, you’re basically getting an assistant chef. Or maybe an IRL Youtube tutorial without the terrible five minute intro.
Then again, if you’re giving someone the gift of a sous vide cooker to receive the gift of advice for what you should use your sous vide cooker, you might involuntarily give them the gift of some advice about how they should use their sous vide cooker… which means, you’re only getting one gift while they get two.

Dearest Martha,
I wish I could say that I miss you. Alas, to suffer only a heavy heart would be a great relief! The truth is much worse than that. I write this letter because I am in grave danger, and I fear that I will suffer not death, but something much worse: a living death of sorts.
Yes, “fear”: a word you likely never thought you would see your husband write. For eight months, I cohabited with wild gorillas. For eleven, I roamed with a pack of wolves. For three, I swam with electric eels. I was buried a whole year among the bulldog ants of Australia in an attempt to understand their tunnel structure. Never once, in any of those cases, did I feel even remotely afraid. But none of them compare to this.
Though it may void my contract with the research firm, I will give you the full details of my current assignment: I was sent to integrate myself into a community of EarPod wearers, so that I might discern once and for all what makes them such incredible assholes.
I have, for the last month, been living among them somewhere in the Bay Area in what I believe is an apartment, but also seems to be a concert venue and startup. The startup is focused on an app of some kind but no one here actually programs. They all work as “organic social marketing disruptors” though many also dabble, I’m told, in graphic design. They wear their EarPods always. And so do I.
This is what I mean by a living death, Martha. Since putting the EarPods in, I have begun to have thoughts that seem not to belong to me. At first it was just, PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT on a constant loop. But as I acclimated, I began to think things like It’s too bad the world isn’t as present as me, or My podcast is better than this one, or What idiot called these EarPods instead of Lil’ Listenies? The other day, I thought once again about them falling out, but this time, it was, If these EarPods fall out, what’s going to keep my head from floating away?
Martha, I am losing it. Or: I am losing myself. So please, come quickly. Unfortunately, I am not sure my exact address, so you will have to fly to San Francisco and look for posters for a show we are hosting, featuring a performance by an artist named Transl8. He does electro-folk, as well as politically-conscious trip-hop.
Also, please bring a pair of Rowkin Bluetooth Earbuds. Just as I needed to take measures in order to avoid the bends when I resurfaced after spending those weeks with the angler fish, so must I do the same now. And those Rowkins are stylish, wireless, and way less obnoxious than EarPods. They should return me to myself in no time.
Make haste.

So, on the one hand, this seems like a smart move for us. Not everyone wants a blanket printed with something, especially not a logo for a deal-a-day site. It can feel like you’re basically an advertisement.

On the other other hand, you’re saying you’d prefer not to associate with us every day you choose not to buy something.
On the other other other hand, maybe buying the blank blankets is more insulting, because you’re coming here, seeing what we’re selling, and saying, “We’re willing to take your blankets, but we don’t want to help you out with some free advertising.”
On the other other other other hand, you are paying us, which does help.

On the other other other other other other hand, that leaves more blankets for you!
On the other other other other other other other hand, this is short term thinking. You might enjoy hoarding blankets now, but eventually the thrill will be gone, and you’ll be left with only blankets and no love. And besides, weren’t you just saying how lonely you were?
On the other other other other other other other other hand, no: it was not you who was lonely. It was me, the man with eight hands, six blankets, and no friends.

Think of your favorite Christmas mornings growing up: you woke up after barely sleeping, rushed to the tree, and tore open your presents. Then maybe came some reprieve–maybe you ate some pancakes and drank some hot cocoa–after which the real fun started: you spent the next several hours painstakingly assembling a tiny model from even tinier pieces so that it could sit atop your desk forevermore!
Okay, maybe that wasn’t exactly how it went. Probably, you played video games, or with some new action figures or dolls. Maybe you watched some movies on TV, maybe you ate more pancakes, drank some more cocoa, maybe you didn’t get out of your pajamas until four in the afternoon when it was time for Christmas dinner, and maybe you were ready for bed at seven, the calories and the sporadic sleep from the night before combining into a potent sleep aid.
And I wouldn’t blame you if that’s what you chose to do. Because those things are more enjoyable than building a model. But here’s something to think about: are they as satisfying?
Because there’s an important difference here. Yes, you might enjoy a candy bar more than taking a jog. Yes, you might enjoy bingeing ten seasons of some guilty-pleasure thriller on Netflix more than spending the afternoon preparing a five-course meal for your visiting relatives. And yes, you’re probably going to enjoy sitting around on the couch on Christmas overindulging in food, toys, and TV (or for adults: food, booze, and basketball) more than building the tiny model of the Eiffel Tower that you got in your stocking.
But you won’t be as satisfied.
Anyone who’s ever done anything requiring a modicum of will-power and ingenuity–even if only to solve a minor problem of their own making–knows that the accompanying frustration quickly gives way to a more lasting pride. Every deep breath you take all day will remind you of that jog. For weeks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment after making that meal. And while you might regret all of the pancakes and cocoa and movies and Christmas cookies well before December 26th, you will always be able to look at your model and think, with a smug sense of satisfaction, I did that.

Ah yes, another gummy purporting to have some vague healing properties. Sounds like the perfect starting point for a rousing round of…
THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE
Here’s how it works: we give you the claim the product makes, explain why we’re more than a little dubious, and then in the end, we come to some conclusion (if ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ can be considered a conclusion). Let’s get started!
The Claim
CBD is “a natural constituent of hemp” that “has been shown to have positive health benefits.” But since it contains no THC, it won’t get you high. Thus, it supposedly can help treat stuff like pain and anxiety with less risk of endless philosophizing or nachos.
The Skepticism
Here are pretty much all of the things we can definitively say about CBD:

It is short for cannabidiol.

Did we get all that? Does anyone need anything repeated? In the back? Can you all hear me?
Okay, that’s a simplification. There’s more. For example, we also know that, like Hansel, this CBD shit is just so hot right now. According to a New York Times article by Alex Williams, Willie Nelson is launching a line of CBD-infused coffee beans (two of his favorite things in one cup, he says), Mandy Moore is toying with it to see if it helps relieve the pain of walking in heels, and Glamour magazine ran a story with the headline “I Replaced My Entire Beauty Routine With Only CBD Products.” I am linking it here as proof. I refuse to actually read it, which I consider an act of self-care.
But what does it actually… do? Gabe Kennedy a twentysomething CBD start-up founder offers this:

Comparing it to the feeling after an intense meditation or yoga session, Mr. Kennedy added that the CBD glow has “synergistic downstream effects” in terms of social connections. “Around others, I find myself more present and attentive, more creative and open.”

To put my reaction in terms that Mr. Kennedy’s ilk would understand, I’d say the ROI on reading that paragraph was that I experienced an exciting disruption in the mouth sector, which, had I not cupped my hand over my lips, might just have gone viral all over my keyboard.
But while it’s fun to mock the eye-roll parade that the article provides, it also validates the claim made by Christie Aschwanden over at FiveThirtyEight: “the marketing has gotten way ahead of the science.”
Aschwanden is definitely more focused on the what than the why. Her article’s thesis is pretty well summed up by its headline: “Does CBD Really Do Anything?” There are definitely some serious WTF moments in here too. For example, when CBD-pedaling doctor Joe Cohen makes the claim that it has anti-cancer properties and might even help with Alzheimers, Aschwanden raises concern that these effects weren’t discussed in two of the most significant cannabis-focused reports out there. The good doctor’s reply: “I think you just have to Google search it.”
Moreover, though, she raises some important points, most notably that we don’t have mixed messages when it comes to CBD; we have almost no messages at all, because very few tests have looked at it on its own:

Animal models and a few human studies suggest that CBD can help with anxiety, but those are the only conditions with much research on CBD in isolation.

Otherwise, most studies focus on cannabinoids more generally, where they have actually found “‘conclusive or substantial evidence’ supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain in adults, multiple sclerosis-related spasticity (a kind of stiffness and muscle spasms), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”
Though, this assumes you’re getting a real dose, which also seems to be up in the air:

There are no guarantees that the label accurately reflects what’s in the product. For a 2015 study published in JAMA, researchers tested 75 products [cannabis] purchased in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle and found that only 17 percent were accurately labeled. More than half of the products contained significantly lower levels of cannabinoids than the label promised, and some of them contained only negligible amounts of the compounds.

The Conclusion
When we promise something here, we hold ourselves to it, so here comes: after reading about CBD, we can say, conclusively, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . But actually, it seems not to be super risky and to have some potentially great outcomes. So if you’re feeling anxious or a little achy, give it a try. Like most of this stuff, if you don’t think of it as a cure-all, you should be fine."	0.06			2018-11-02T04:00:05.893Z	0.42612956253890216	0.93	66292

It’s easy to come up with jokes about these things, and not just because they’re called “Lovesac Sactionals.” Like, imagine replacing all of a friend’s furniture with these one night, so they awake and believe they’ve grown. Or imagine a business man who uses them in his office as a power move, so that whenever someone comes to meet with him, they have to sit crouched to the ground feeling small.
But really, this hilarious world I’m describing, where everything is out of proportion is actually what young kids experience all the time, just inverted.
As @Superllama7 helpfully points out, “kids and pets can also use adult-sized furniture.” This is true, of course. Yet adult-sized furniture doesn’t really give kids a sense of ownership. Kids have toys and books. They have a bedroom they might share, and a bed to sleep in. But rarely are they given their own little space for quiet comfort in daytime, which is too bad, because it’s something they might like.
@2palms’s daughter did, at least: “with the double-wide seat she can get a leg up, then camp out in the corner with her books.” If that sounds super cute, I’ve got news for you: it is. @2palms includes two adorable pictures of “quiet morning reading time” on one of the 2 “chaise lounges” they put together. (@2palms elsewhere describes the Sactional furniture’s sturdiness, in case that’s a concern).

That’s ridiculous, Lucy. It’s 2018; you need furniture for casual get-togethers.

I, Clive Grunley, am not a mere athlete. Nor a biathlete. Nor a triathlete or anything so simple. No sir, I am a sexdecathlete, if you know what I mean!
What I mean is I compete in competitions comprising of sixteen distinct athletic feats. Why do you look so surprised? Did you think a sexdecathlete was something else?
A traditional sexdecathlon begins with a twenty mile run (1). Next, is a swim of at least 4 miles (2), but additional miles can be swum to earn tokens which can be used to hire additional bridge builders to help you build the bridge (3) back over the body of water you just swam across.
After that comes the javelin toss (4), followed by a short sprint (5), in order so that you can catch the same javelin you just tossed (6), and then, while holding it aloft, discuss with several gifted undergraduates how the javelin can serve, in literature, as a metaphor for one’s ascension and subsequent decline (7).
This is followed by a water break, which is not a break as in a moment of reprieve, but another event wherein each competitor builds a mold, pours water into it, freezes it, and then breaks the sculpture upon the shoulder of a competitor before they have one broken over theirs (8). Those who lose are disqualified, and given a strong handshake by those continuing on (9).
Next, you chop down a tree (10), then climb at least halfway up the tree (11), and carve some part of the three into a surfboard (12) while it is falling, so that you have something to ride when your tree eventually lands in the wave pool. You then ride a wave (13) to the artificial “shore” wherein a meeting ensues among remaining competitors as to how you might maintain the tree-related events while also promoting sustainability (14).
Which leaves nothing to do but cross the finish line (15) and exchange high fives (16). Yes, these count as events, as the finish line is a moat filled with poisonous snakes and we call them high fives because they must be completed atop a nearby mountain of you and your high-fiving partner’s choosing.
Anyway, the point being: after a long sexdecathlon, I’m beat. And I need at least three Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Packs to sooth my aches. I especially like that the texture provided by the ceramic beads allows for a nice massage. And let me tell you, us sexdecathletes might all be different, but every one of us likes a good rub!

If you’re shopping for yourself, you can get any food processor you want. You can take your parents’ old food processor. You can go to the thrift store, find one, search around for an outlet to make sure it spins, and take that one home. Or maybe you don’t need to go through all that trouble; maybe you just buy it as soon as you see it. If it doesn’t work, oh well! It was only a few bucks.
But if you’re getting someone a food processor as a gift, you need to do a little bit better than that. You don’t want to give your husband or wife or newly married friend something used that you’re pretty sure works. You need to give them something clean, something shiny, something new.
More than that: you need to give them a brand they’ve heard of. Because, come Christmas morning, you don’t want to have to lean over and say something like, “Chop Corp actually makes great food processors. You might not have heard of them, because they’re only sold in Kroger grocery stores in and around Columbus, Ohio. But they’re actually assembled from leftover Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach parts so that every model is functional and unique! And if you want, I watched a few youtube videos about replacing parts, so we could really ‘hack’ this thing, so to speak. Here, I have a screwdriver and soldering gun! Let’s do this!”
It’s much better to say, “It’s KitchenAid, so you know it’s good.”
If you want to say more, you can. For example, you could talk about how its drizzle basin allows for the easy incorporation of liquid ingredients. Or how it has two speeds and pulse so you can make anything from a chunky salsa to a smooth hummus. Or even how the work bowl, lid, and blade are all dishwasher safe.

Four truths and three lies about the artist Adam Koford:


Adam Koford, as a shirt designer often under the moniker of “Apelad”, has sold more than 260 designs on websites like Shirt.Woot, including several that this former Woot copywriter often still thinks of and laughs aloud.


Adam Koford’s art studio is in a house boat currently floating in international waters, the only place he can execute his diabolical pencil hold without being taken into police custody.


Adam Koford was, for a time, a jockey. He and his horse Maple Syrup were dominant, winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. On the track of the Belmont Stakes, though, disaster struck. Just feet from the finish line, Maple Syrup collapsed in a cloud of gray smoke, at which point it was discovered Maple Syrup was not a horse at all, but a robot powered, at its center, by a tiny car driving on a tiny treadmill.


Adam Koford is the creator of Laugh-Out-Loud Cats, a webcomic which can be viewed at HOBOTOPIA.com, as well as in a new book, One More For The Road, COMING SOON (stay tuned to Hobotopia for an official announcement in a couple weeks). A few months ago, he posted his 3000th Laugh-Out-Loud cats drawing. And since pictures are each worth a thousand words, that means Koford has produced the equivalent of 3 million words, the equivalent of somewhere between 30 and 50 novels. That’s impressive!


Adam Koford opens bananas by making several exacting surgical incisions with a scalpel. The peel-removal process can take up to two hours, but according to Koford, it’s worth it. “If you respect the fruit,” he says, “it will in turn respect you by unlocking heretofore hidden flavors.”


Adam Koford has worked as a senior writer and story artist on the video game versions of Bolt, Toy Story 3, and Cars 2. Which means he can say things like, “I wrote Toy Story 3,” and not technically be lying!


Adam Koford designed today’s shirt.

That kind of relief can feel almost euphoric, because it’s basically freedom. You don’t need to sample anymore. You don’t need to settle. That little operation in your brain that you’ve been forever running in the background, looking for that special something, can be discontinued, the energy rerouted.
But as strong as the relief can be, it is often matched by the subsequent disappointment. They tinkered with the formula of the hair gel. They changed the shape of the running shoe.

Many considered A Portal Among The Pages, published in 1978, to be the book that marked science fiction author Hal Pembry’s ascension from merely great into the canon. His previous seven novels to that point had been entertaining and thought-provoking, but few managed to evoke the magic that Portal  seemed to achieve so easily. As one reviewer wrote, “When Finley [the book’s protagonist] first finds the Encyclopedia of Time, he does not know that it functions essentially as a time machine, yet he senses something special between the covers. Readers might find this sensation quite relatable, as they sit in their favorite chair, holding Pembry’s masterwork aloft.”
His fans were eager to see what he would come up with next. And they were profoundly disappointed when the answer turned out to be: nothing. Pembry never wrote another book. In fact, he disappeared altogether. Many assumed he’d gone the way of other successful literary eccentrics–that the fame had been too much for him and so he’d retired somewhere quiet for a life of seclusion. Others posited that the terrible film adaptation had driven him to flee out of embarrassment. A small faction of particularly conspiracy-minded fans put forward a theory of murder at the hands of Kyle Tolliver, a rival author driven mad by jealousy because his own stellar novel’s release had been eclipsed by Portal (this being a pun many newspapers made while discussing the books’ relative sales, as Tolliver’s concerned a deadly solar eclipse).
None of these theories came close to the truth. In actuality, Pembry’s novel was a confession of what was to come: he’d discovered a way in which he could, through literature, bend time. I know because he told me when I spotted him last week outside of a used bookstore in Omaha. He did not look a day older than his author photo from forty years ago.
I asked what he thought of life in our current age and he said, “It’s okay. There are many things that science fiction foresaw, only different in minor ways. There are robots that work for you, but the one’s that move have no personality, and the ones with personality don’t move. They live in speakers and phones. And then there’s that.”
He pointed to the GOTRAX Hoverfly ECO Hover Board I had ridden up on.
“I’ve read all about those. About how their electrical safety is certified, about how they can go nearly 8 miles per hour and up to 12 miles distance before needing a charge. It’s truly a work of ingenuity. Only, when I and many of my contemporaries had imagined hover-vehicles, I thought they would truly hover. Again, it’s not that I’m unimpressed. Sometimes, I wish there was just a bit more whimsy. At any rate, I ought to be going.”
I asked him where and he corrected me. “It’s when,” he said, then told me to name a year. 1919 was what came to mind, and he took out a small unmarked book from his blazer pocket, opened it to a specific page somewhere in the middle. “Ah,” he said. “Interesting.” He pointed to a line written on the page. I tried to lean over and see but in that moment, there came a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew, Pembry was gone."	0.05			2018-10-26T04:00:03.801Z	0.24495605686952773	0.93	63926

We all have our preferences when it comes to luggage. Some of us prefer the hard-sided rolling bag. We like that what we see is what we get, that its shape remains steadfast always. We find comfort in knowing that our things will be safe inside. Perhaps we go on a vacation and buy a commemorative glass; with our hard-sided luggage we can be sure that it will be safe, as long as you don’t pack it too loosely. You don’t have to worry about some other bag in the cargo crushing it.
Others of us prefer the duffel. It’s casual but also classic. It can go down the street to the gym, or across the world to Shanghai. If you don’t have much to pack, it’ll take up less space. You can pack lightly or overpack a little bit. Its soft sides are forgiving. Also: they’re malleable. Pack one full of clothes, and you can squeeze it almost anywhere. It’s like a firmer pillow.
And yet…
There are times when we wish our hard-sided luggage had just a little bit more give to fit in the tight space behind the passenger seat of a fully packed car. And there are times when we’d like trust our duffel to hold its shape just a little bit more. For example, when we travel to wine country in Oregon, we want to bring back a bottle of wine, not a bag full of wet wine-scented clothing and some decorative shards of glass.
In other words: when it comes to bag-style our preference is not as firm as we might think. And facing this knowledge, it quickly becomes clear that the options aren’t hard-sided or duffel. They’re:

We can refuse to choose. We can eschew bags altogether. We can wear all of the clothes we want to bring on a given trip, layered over each other. The top layer can be pair of cargo pants and a hoodie with a big pouch. In the pockets: our toiletries, our travel knickknacks, our phones, etc.

Or…

We can choose both. As in, we can buy one of each: a U.S. Polo hard-sided bag, and a U.S. Polo rolling duffel. If we’re going for ten days at the vase expo, we can bring the hard-sided luggage. If we’re driving across the country and want something that’s easy to roll in and out of motels every night, we can take the duffel. But with both, we always have what you need.

Okay, fine. This is manipulative. If you really want to buy just one or the other, that’s fine too… But know this: some day, you might regret that choice–some day, you might need those hard sides or that soft top–and when that day comes, we won’t be able to help you.

There’s a double-standard here. If you buy a shirt that’s slimming and shave every day because your facial hair comes in patchy or comb your hair a certain way that looks best with your face-shape, it wouldn’t be considered inauthentic. If anything, it’s the opposite. It shows an intelligence, an understanding of what you have and what works best. Because none of those things are harmful or uncomfortable or particularly time-consuming. They’re just simple steps you take to look your best.
On the other hand, if you try to slow the thinning of your hair–or at least slow the appearance of your hair thinning–that’s considered inauthentic. It’s mocked. Men are told that going bald is embarrassing, but also that covering up baldness is embarrassing. Because it exhibits some denial of reality, a fight against what nature has intended for you.
To which, we reply: Yeah, no shit! And there’s nothing wrong with that!
Maybe at some point, we can all wear ponchos, choosing between three or four each morning based solely on thickness of material. Those who are not going bald will stop cutting their hair, and those who are going bald will allow their hair to recede without ridicule. We will all stop showering, and we will all stop brushing our teeth, and we will cease complaining about the natural odors of our bodies and breath. And if some lose their teeth because theirs are weak, they will drink only nutritional juice of a greenish-brown color, and no one will judge them for it.
Until then, we just gotta do what we gotta do to look whatever way feels best. And if that’s using a hair fiber and locking spray, so be it.

“It’s not them either,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s certainly dolls and stuffed toys,” the exorcist proclaimed. “Raggedy Annes and Andys, sock monkeys, and teddy bears, all singing ironic songs of friendship while stalking your every move, each brandishing pencils sharpened into shivs.”
“Actually,” the toy seller said, “it’s fidget spinners.”
“Wait, what? Fidget spinners? Seriously?”
“I’m afraid it’s very serious,” the toy seller said. “They just won’t stop… spinning.”
“That’s it,” the exorcist said. “They’re just spinning? Like fidget spinners do? But on their own?”
“Exactly! And I have work to do! But I can’t anything done! Because I’m so distracted by their infernal noises! Some of them even glow!”
The exorcist nodded. “I understand. They glow brightly with the spirits of the dead.”
“Nope,” the toy seller said. “They’re just the LED kind. And they don’t all glow very brightly. They’re pretty hit-or-miss, to be honest. A lot of them are fine, but the lights on some are dim, or out entirely. That’s why we’re selling them for cheaper than the non-LED ones.”

The toy seller did not object. In fact, he hugged him and thanked him with tears and his eyes. The exorcist assured him it would all be okay.

Welcome to everyone’s favorite day: Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, wherein we offer a new shirt or whatever every Sunday until, eventually, we get lazy or forget and it ends! Today’s shirt requires a little more explanation than the others. Basically, it’s the Casemates launch shirt, on royal blue… BUT you get a choice: the original sketchy version of the logo (and that’s sketchy as in sketch-like; not like, “it can’t be trusted”) or a new exciting more geometric-looking logo!
That leaves you with four potential purchase choices:
You Purchase The Classic Design
This the option for people who respect tradition. You want a shirt you can wear each night when you return to your victorian home and settle into your bergère chair to re-read Don Quixote. What’s that playing in the background? Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16, of course. And what’s that you’re drinking? Maybe a glass of 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir, or maybe a Boulevardier cocktail that you’ve been antiquing for a few days in a mason jar in the fridge. It all goes just smashingly with your new (or should we say old?) Casemates shirt!
You Purchase The New Design
Here, we have the modern choice. You’ll look right at home wearing this when you pull your electric car into the driveway of your house, a recent construction comprised, it appears, of only the most jagged of edges. Inside, you’ll ask your digital assistant to play the latest release from your favorite musician, a masked individual from a country far away who makes electronic music that is one step removed from the dial-up modem noise. Then you’ll settle in to read a collection of experimental prose poetry while sitting on a piece of brutalist furniture that might be a couch but also might be an end table; you can’t remember. What you are sure of: how comfortable you feel in your exciting new Casemates shirt!
You Purchase Both
This one goes out to all those who toe the line between classic and modern. You like mid-century modern furniture. You listen to blue-grass covers of new wave songs and new wave covers of blue-grass songs. In short, you appreciate all things: from the old and traditional to the new and innovative. If we may be so bold: this is definitely the best choice.
You Purchase Neither
This choice, on the other hand… well, it’s not really a choice at all. It’s the absence of one. You’ve essentially chosen not to choose. To put it bluntly, you are empty. You see stories about rescue dogs on Facebook and feel nothing. you stand directly in front of the elevator doors waiting for them to open, not because you’re in a rush, not because you think you’re better than other people, but because you haven’t thought at all. Often, you feel as though you’ve forgotten something. Your phone? No. It’s in your pocket. Your wallet? No. That’s there too. Your keys? No again. Really, you have forgotten nothing; instead, what you’re experiencing is the sensation of your being crying out to fill the hole where a soul should be.
Anyway, hope this helps you make your decision! Happy Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, and until next time (if there is a next time)…"	0.07			2018-10-21T04:00:03.298Z	0.49400280593593765	0.94	54240

See, here’s what’s so annoying about this:
This is a drone. It does what drones do. It flies around for nine minutes, hovers in the air, etc. @Moose tested it. He said it actually was one of the easiest to fly, and might be the most stable of the ones he’s tried for our site. They could’ve marketed it for that: its ease and stability.
Or maybe they could’ve called it a photo drone or a video drone, because it does have a camera that can take 1.3MP pictures and 720p videos. After all, drones are often used for photos or videos. My pretty basic wedding package featured a video done with a drone. Remember that shot at the end of 10 Things I Hate About You, of the band playing on the top of building while the credits rolled? That shot probably required licensed pilots, a helicopter, crew members, waivers, the works. Now, anyone could make something that looks like that, for, I’d estimate, 5 figures less thanks to drones. Like this one.
And no: a Remake-The-Last-Shot-Of-10-Things-I-Hate-About-You-Or-Something-Like-It Drone isn’t exactly going to move units here in 2018… but it would probably be better than Selfie Drone.
Like, are you fucking serious? The phrase “selfie drone” is verbal ipecac. It takes ingenuity and renders it into an overcomplicated way for millennials to engage in the act that has become synonymous with the self-absorption most other generations (wrongly) know them for.
Still, what annoys me isn’t the how clear it is that this product was definitely named by some old dude thinking he’d discovered a new way to “reach the youth.” It had to be, by the way, because, say what you will about millennials, they at least know what a selfie is, and a photo that you need a drone’s angle to capture is not a selfie; it’s a photo with you in it. There’s a difference.
What annoys me is how reductive it is. It’s a dumb marketing 101. It thinks it’s carved out some entirely new lane in the drone game by catering to the selfie-obsessed among us, without taking into account the large number of people that it would turn off. Like, there are probably folks who arrived at the site today, read the product name, and said, “oh, no way,” and navigated away without reading another word. Or even if they did get further, they might still be thinking, It could be cool… but cool enough to risk my friends seeing a box that says “Selfie Drone” on it in the week before the recycling gets picked up? I don’t know…
That’s what really annoys me. But it doesn’t annoy me that much, to be honest. I mean, there’s a reason we can sell this thing here for $20. And it’s not because it’s a bad drone."	0.07			2018-10-20T04:00:46.966Z	0.34139579152096994	0.94	51885

Dear iRobot,
You’ve done what many companies aspire to do, but few actually achieve. In this stratosphere of success, your company is elite: Xerox, Kleenex, Ping Pong. Your product’s name–the Roomba–is now synonymous with (or maybe even supersedes) the “robot vacuum cleaner.” Congratulations.
And many of us here at Meh have been along for the ride since nearly day one. Yet, there’s something that’s frustrated us over the years: every time we sell a Roomba, we realize the model is slightly different than the previous one, despite looking almost exactly the same. We then dive into hours of research, hoping to solve the mystery of what’s so different in order to help our customers make an informed purchasing decision–only to find, in the end,  something trivial, like the canister capacity being one tenth of a percent larger than before.
What we’re saying here, iRobot, is: help us. Or, help us help you. Why not give every  new Roomba a feature that really STANDS OUT, so that they can be easily differentiated?
For example:


You could make one that says “sorry” whenever it bumps into a wall. An another that cries out in pain whenever it bumps into a wall. And another that recites a poem by Robert Frost in a Mike Tyson accent whenever it bumps into a wall.


Or a model that kisses your ankles when it goes by so that you know it loves you.


How about a Roomba that can take all the crumbs from the kitchen floor and forms them into new snacks for you to serve at your next party?


Maybe one Roomba could feature “pie warmth and texture.” And then the ""Plus ""version of that model could also feature “pie flavor.” And it could just be a pie.


Or what about a Roomba that just came with one completely functional human finger? Is that too much to ask?


Look, iRobot: the sensors, the 3-Stage Cleaning System, the ability to automatically adjust to any floor and navigate around furniture–that stuff is cool and all, but it’s also what we expect. Why not give people something a bit more unique? It would certainly be great for us. And if it’s great for us, isn’t it great for you too?
Just something to think about.
Sincerely,
Meh"	0.05			2018-10-19T04:00:01.945Z	0.2510909468726189	0.92	61001

Twelve-year-olds Arthur and Lisa, having split up to cover more of the town, reconvened at the tree house to compare their trick-or-treat bounties. They’d both dressed as zombies, but even through all the gory face paint, their disappointment was clear.
“Another lame Halloween,” Arthur said. “It’s like, what’s wrong with giving out candy? Everyone around here tries to get too creative. I got the worst stuff.”
“You got the worst? Wait until you see what I’ve got,” Lisa said.
They sat down and began removing items from their respective glowing Pop Lights bags.
“Look at this,” Arthur said. “Someone gave me one Triscuit!”
“If you want something to dip it in, I’ve got a bunch of ketchup packets here from an old lady,” Lisa said. “Hey, what’s that sloshing noise?”
“Loose soup,” Arthur said. “The guy just ladled it into my bag.”
Lisa leaned over and looked. “Are those malt balls floating in it?”
“Nope. Meatballs. It’s Italian wedding.”
“At least you can eat that,” Lisa said. “I don’t know what to do with these ticket stubs from a 1992 Celine Dion concert.”
Arthur put on a pair of eyeglasses. “Let me see them.”
Lisa handed the stubs over. “I didn’t know you wore glasses.”
“I don’t,” Arthur said. “Someone on Fourth was handing these out.”
“New?”
“Gently used,” Arthur said.
“Maybe I could use them to read this.” Lisa pulled out a stack of papers from her glowing Halloween bag. “Guy on twelfth was giving out copies of his unfinished novel. And I need to have critiques back to him in two weeks.”
“How is it?”
“It’s okay. There are some point of telling issues. Like, if you’re going to use a retrospective POV, the narrator can’t be surprised by the events as they unfold. Also, some of the fantastical elements frustrate me. I keep thinking: what are the rules of this world?”
“Huh,” Arthur said. “I wouldn’t be much help. I’m a journalist, not a novelist. Or at least I am now that a woman on Church Street gave me this.” He handed a diploma over to Lisa.
“Wow, a journalism degree! From George Washington University! They could be really useful,” Lisa said, “for mopping up the soup!”
“Hey, good idea,” Arthur said.
“I have no idea what to do with this.” Lisa held a sheet of paper.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“An NDA,” Lisa said.
“For what?”
“I can’t tell you.”
The two of them fell silent for a moment.
“You want one of these I Trick-or-Treated 2018 stickers?” Arthur offered.
Lisa took one. “Thanks. You want any of these Spirit Airline points I got over on Main?”
“Sure. How about some opportunities to build real wealth and passive income through direct marketing? Someone on Grand was handing those out.”
“Couldn’t hurt,” Lisa said.
“That’s it for me,” Arthur said. “And to think: I thought my parents were the lame ones for handing out some fidget spinners they bought online. What a bust!”
“Actually, maybe it wasn’t a total bust. A family on Breezy Lane did give me this.” Lisa took it out and set it down between them.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“I think it’s another, smaller, Halloween.” Lisa pointed at something swirling. “See, look.”

Probably, we should lie. We should say that this is practical. We should say something like: you can garden from inside! We should claim something about how, with the success of HBO’s Sharp Objects, wealthy families have a renewed interest in dollhouses, and some of them are even hiring full construction crews to break ground and build them; get the heavy duty equipment your crew needs to beat out the other bidders!
But we won’t. Instead, we’ll look both ways, we’ll lean forward, we’ll gesture for your to lean forward too, and then we’ll whisper into your ear…
We’re selling this so you can give it as a gift.
We’re cautious to admit this because you know how people get. The holiday season is filled with camaraderie, but few forms are as cathartic as uniting against its annual encroachment. They’ve got the decorations up and it’s not even December, you’ll say to a stranger in the coffee shop. Are they playing “Jingle Bells”? Before Thanksgiving? someone will say in the checkout line at the grocery store. You’ll shake your head when Santa’s village appears in the mall before the first significant snowfall, or when you see a flyer informing you that Black Friday sales somehow start on Tuesday this year.
And here we are, making our first offering of the gift-giving season weeks before Halloween! What gall, you think. What nerve. But friends: hear us out. By offering this R/C Excavator today, we’re not trying to get a jump on anyone… but ourselves.
Though we don’t always act like it, at the end of the day, we’re a store. The holiday season should be our time to shine. And yet, to really “kill it” during the holidays, you need to be sure of yourself. You need to be organized, to know when things will ship and how long they will take to get to where they’re going. You need to build a balanced approached; you can’t just sell a bunch of toys or a bunch of electronics or a bunch of socks. You need to offer all three at different times based on sales trends from previous years.

FLEECE BLANKETS!
I don’t know about where you all live, but here, the weather has taken a dark turn. It even snowed yesterday! Which means: it’s time to make a nice cup of tea or cocoa and bundle up under a fleece blanket on the couch with one to twelve dogs and/or cats for the next five months.
THE MATH
The four-pack will run you $14. That’s $3.50 per blanket. Not bad, right? But wait! The twenty-four pack goes for $60. That’s $2.50 per blanket. But wait even more! If the first four cost $14, that means the last twenty cost just $46, which is $2.30 per blanket! Does it make sense to break it down like that? Probably not! But that’s how we do it here on Order/Hoarder days!
WHAT TO DO WITH FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
With four fleece blankets, you can put one on the couch, one on recliner, keep one in the office, and still have a backup to rotate in when one is being washed. Or, store them all in a closet and break them out for a late fall bonfire.
WHAT TO DO WITH TWENTY-FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
So! Much! For example:


You could give them out as gifts to twenty-four of your favorite people!


Or, if you don’t have twenty-four favorite people, give them as gifts to twelve of your favorite people! (You can use the remaining twelve fleece blankets as wrapping paper for the other twelve fleece blankets!)


Send one to each venue on your favorite band’s 24-stop winter tour to show you’re a true fan!


Or, give one to all but four members of the twenty-eight piece Swedish indie pop group, I’m From Barcelona, in case they have to play any cold weather outdoor festivals! If they complain about not everyone getting a blanket, just tell them you’re not the idiot who decided to start a twenty-eight person band!


Use them to build a winter-ready tent in the bank yard! Actually, hell, you’ve got 24 fleece blankets! Build a winter-ready tent mansion!


Interior decorators will tell you that the right lighting can give rooms a soft, warm feeling; we say, why stop at lights? Why not take that “soft, warm feeling” over the top by wallpapering your house with fleece blankets?


See? Maybe twenty-four fleece blankets isn’t so impractical after all.

Let’s start off general and work our way into more specifics. Every laptop manufacturer calls their product something different, but a Chromebook isn’t just a cool name. It’s actually a different kind of computer. Laptop Magazine sums it up nicely:

Instead of Windows 10 or macOS, Chromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. These machines are designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with most applications and documents living in the cloud.

In other words, if you live in a cabin somewhere in the mountains, and you have to hike and ski many miles back to civilization to grab a solitary bar of wi-fi, this might not be your best bet. Nor would it be a good option if you’re looking for a machine that can support your career cutting movie trailers and playing the latest computer games. These things are pretty sparse, in terms of power.
But for the rest of us, who pretty much never stray far from the router and who mostly use our computers for checking email, keeping track of things, writing, and organizing: a Chromebook is actually a pretty great, pretty cheap option.
And this one is actually both of those things: we’re selling it for just under $150, and on Amazon it has four stars on over 1,000 reviews.
Yes, if you want to be cynical, you could say: but wait, Meh, this thing came back out who-knows-when, and many of those reviews were written a while ago. And that’s true. BUT 1) there were still five star reviews coming in as recently as August of 2018; and 2) never underestimate the online reviewer. Like, these people self-identify as arbiters of all that is good (and not good) to buy; do you really think they wouldn’t rush to update their review the minute anything goes wrong?
Besides, let’s be totally honest: as much as we like to talk about the forward march of tech, most of us are still using our computers for the exact same things as we did five years ago. New apps come and go, but we’ll always need to make spreadsheets and type up documents and check our email.

Mr. Khool was the coolest teacher at Meh High. He taught an elective called The Mathematics of Skating, a class he only managed to get approved after bringing the principal to a skate park and catching phat air while explaining how each side of a halfpipe was essentially a graph of exponential growth. Now, he was on his way to teach his first session of it when, rounding a corner, he heard stifled sobs.
Narf, hunched next to the water fountain, tried to straighten up when he saw Mr. Khool approaching. “Oh, hey, Mr. Khool. I was just… uh… making sure the fountains weren’t leaking.”
“Sounds like the only thing leaking are your eyes, l’il guy,” said Mr. Khool, crouching next to him. “You want to talk about it?”

“I know what you’re going through,” Mr. Khool said.
“You do?”
“Sure! Being a cool guy is great, but sometimes it’s hard to get people to take me seriously. They think it’s all kick flips and cliff jumps, when really that’s only like 60 to 70 percent of what I do. There’s also a lot of hard work that nobody gives me credit for. But you know what? Whenever I start to feel like maybe it’s time to trade my longboard in for a Prius, I remind myself: there’s a reason progress and persistence both start with p. A friend of mine told me that once. His name was Tony Hawke.”
Narf’s eyes went wide. “Tony Hawk the skateboarder?”
“No,” Mr. Khool said. “This is Hawke with an e. He was Ethan Hawke’s second cousin. We played in a band together in college. And actually he went by Anthony.”
“So do you just call him Tony Hawke so people think you’re talking about Tony Hawk?”
“It doesn’t matter why I do it,” Mr. Khool said. “The point is, it’s a decision I made to call him Tony. And we all have decisions to make in this life. So, are you going to give up, or are you going to decide to keep chasing your dreams?”
Narf stood up. “You’re right! It doesn’t matter that it’s taken this long! I can’t give up now, not for anything!”
“That’s right! So, what is it that you’ve been asking for?”
“A cat shirt,” Narf said.
“Wait, seriously?” Mr. Khool said, getting to his feet. “But you’re Narf. You’re wearing a cat shirt right now. And you wore one yesterday. And the day before that. And actually every other day too. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the same cat shirt twice, now that I think about it.”
Narf slung his backpack over his shoulder. “Sorry, Mr. Khool. I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve gotta get to chem. Thanks again! You really said exactly what I needed to hear!”
“That’s great,” Mr. Khool said. “Although, maybe we need some other designs?”
But Narf was already off and running to his next class.

Douglas, We’re glad you’re here. We can see you’re confused, but don’t worry: all will be explained. You see, when LeAnn said to come home so you two could “take a scenic flight over a pristine lake” together, she was lying. This is an intervention. We, your friends and family–we’re all worried about you, Douglas.
It all began when you bought that Odyssey Stellar NX Drone. You said it was a way to bond with your son. But you didn’t let Trevor use it much, did you, Douglas? Still, it was a fun hobby for you. You liked that it came with a VR headset, so you could see from the drone’s POV. You would fly it, recharge it, fly it, recharge it, all day.
Only after a few months did we start to see the warning signs. You walked into furniture, cursing your legs. You started standing on the dining table to watch television. You called this “a more natural prospective.”
Then there was the mini drone that came with your purchase of the original drone. You started calling it ‘l’il guy,’ then ‘son,’ then finally you named it. It would’ve seemed cute, if you didn’t choose, ‘Trevor,’ the same name as your real son.
Yes, Douglas, that’s right: only one of them is your real son. Because you are not a drone, Douglas! You are a man! You might spend days coming out of drone-prospective for only as long as it takes your Odyssey to charge. You might spend these times with your eyes closed tight, whispering, “it’s a dream, it’s just a dream,” so as not to face the fact that you are a human being, and as such, you are bound by gravity to remain on the ground.
But it’s not healthy, Douglas! You have a family! You have a job! You have obligations! You can’t just ignore them because you have “a new life in the sky” now. It can be a fun hobby, but you’ll never really be a drone, Douglas. You need to start seeing that. And moreover, you need to apologize to all of us for what you’ve put us through. Let’s start with Trevor.

User @alacrity wants one thing and one thing only: a margarita.
When we sold a Copper Cookware set, they wrote:

well, I guess I could serve margaritas in these…

On a two-pack of posture trainers:

it has to be said: these make really shitty margaritas.

For a 2-pack of cast aluminum skillets:

well, I guess I could drink a margarita out of em… but there’s still the salted rim thing.

A coffee maker:

this will make very hot margaritas.

Earrings:

these are absolutely useless for margaritas.

You might notice that these are not all sales from the last few months. No, @alacrity has lived with desire for years. But that will change today. Because today we are selling a Cuisinart Waring Pro Blade Blender.
And yet the story does not end here. What we want to know is: how does @alacrity feel about this?
Will they arrive at the site today relieved? Will they cry aloud, “For many years I have wished for nothing more than a sweet lime-rich tequila cocktail. And at long last, the great Meh has delivered to me a device that shall itself deliver me to my own personal paradise. Thank you, Meh! Thank you so much!”?
Or will they feel some resentment? Will they realize, all too late, that the real margarita was the friends they made along the way? Or, to put it differently: is there any margarita that’s as sweet on the lips as camaraderie is to the heart?
And yet, there remains a fact we have not reconciled: uhh, like, hello? We’ve sold blenders before!
So perhaps we’re misreading @alacrity. Perhaps, they do not hope for their own margaritas at all. Perhaps they seek only to be a sort of margarita-specific town-crier, to stand in the virtual park at the center of Meh and warn all those around them about the dangers of attempting margaritas in products not optimized for margaritas.
And then of course, there is the final possibility: maybe @alacrity prefers margaritas on the rocks.
So what is it? Only time will tell. And by time, we mean: hopefully @alacrity in the forums."	0.05			2018-10-12T04:00:20.860Z	0.34750686103289724	0.94	59130

Watches? I never wear watches. Why would I wear a watch in the age of cellphones? That’s what I say. Because I believe in efficiency. It guides my every waking move, from the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the time I lay down to sleep at night. (That’s the alarm on my phone, by the way. Why have an alarm clock when you have a cell phone?)
But it’s one thing to say you believe in efficiency, and it’s a whole other thing to live by it. I know because I do. To prove it, I’ll run through my average morning:
First thing’s first, I make breakfast. It’s the same every day: spaghetti and meatballs. I have it for lunch too. And dinner. Food is food, isn’t it? Why should I have different foods for different meals?
When I’m done eating, I floss and brush my teeth, then spit into the drain in my shower. Because why have a sink when you have a shower? Is not a shower a human-height sink? Think about that for a second. Anyway, when I’m done brushing my teeth, I wash my hands with shampoo. Soap-products are soap-products, after all! Then I shave, checking my reflection in the mirror–by which I mean, my phone, on selfie mode.
A little bit of leisure time is part of being efficient too. So, before heading out the door to work, I take twenty minutes to relax. I might watch a show (on my phone) or read a book (on my phone). But soon enough it’s time to check the weather (on my phone). To confirm the app, I look out the window–the single window I have in my whole house. Why do I need to see out my house from so many different sides? Outside is outside, no matter what way you’re looking at it. One window is plenty.
Using this information, I decide what I’m going to wear: pants or shorts. I should elaborate; it’s the one garment, but it’s got a zipper so I can unzip them at the knee when it gets warm. It’s the same pair I wear every day, because again, for me it’s all about efficiency. Not everyone is a fan of this. My sister, for example, once said she actually hated my zip-on pant-shorts. She said I should switch things up by wearing something else sometimes. She said that by wearing them I was ruining her wedding. Can you believe that?
She hasn’t spoken to me since then, but I don’t mind. I still have another sister, and honestly, at the time, I was in the middle of a painful decision of which sister I would keep. Two sisters? Are you crazy? Who needs all that in your life?
Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh, right: these watches. Yep, don’t need them. Although, they would go nicely with the one sweatshirt always I wear, especially on days when it’s hot enough that I have to roll up the sleeves. And if you’re wondering why I don’t just take it off, it’s simple: I’m not wearing anything underneath. Wearing a shirt under what is essentially another shirt?

Imagine for a moment you’re a secret agent. You’ve been called upon to infiltrate a very important party held by a tycoon with designs to take over the world. You need to take a video of the party, so key attendees can be identified, and hopefully sneak into the study where you’re told the plans for the doomsday device are kept. For this mission, you’ll be provided with a PogoCam. It’s smaller than a tube of lip balm, attaches magnetically to your favorite pair of glasses, and shoots 5 megapixel photos and 720p HD videos. You just need to go to Q to collect it.
FYI: in this imagined scenario, Q refers to the dumpster behind the Qwikmart convenience store down the block, not the genius gadgeteer from the movies. Because, boy oh boy, would that guy steer clear of this thing.
In fact, over on Amazon the PogoCam only has 2.5 stars. That’s some real ruh-roh territory, especially given most products fall into a 3 star rating just by being delivered. People who bought it without the Pogotrack sunglasses offered here griped about the safety loop required when using your own pair.  Others complain about the picture quality or that it only takes 30-second video clips.  One user goes even further: “while I have little proof,” LE says, “[I] believe PogoCam has been the cause of much of the world’s turmoil lately.”
Not great!
But here’s the thing: since it’s come out and been revealed to be of less than desirable quality, the PogoCam’s price has tanked. In fact, I’m told that at one point is retailed for as high as $150. That’s nuts. But even with all those price drops, it’s still just shy of 50 on the 'zon.
We’re selling it for $24. For that price, it can just be a fun little gimmicky impulse buy. Wear it once or twice and you’ve pretty much justified the purchase. If you get it to work better than a bunch of Amazon reviewers and find some real use for it, awesome! If not, at least you got some sweet magnetic sunglasses out of the deal.

There were only two of them in the conference room, but when the engineer placed the SmartStand prototype on the table, his hands still shook with anxiety, as if he were making a presentation to the entire company. In a way, he was. Across the table sat the founder and CEO.
“Looks simple.”
“Just as you asked, sir,” the engineer said.
“So let’s talk features,” said the CEO. “It can hold your tablet or phone while you’re cooking, so that the recipe is easy to read?”
“Yes, sir,” said the engineer.
“And it tracks the ingredients used, placing orders based on what’s running low in your cabinet and refrigerator?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it intuit how romantic a given meal seems, and adjust the room’s lighting accordingly?”
“No, sir.”
“Does it feature an olfactory sensor that reads the smell of the meal and gives spicing advice?”
“No, sir.”
“Let’s talk about travel use: on an airplane, it can hold up your phone or tablet making it easier to watch a show or movie?”
“Yes, sir.”
“And it can place drink orders with the flight attendant, based upon the mood of said show or movie?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it message the gate attendants of your connecting flight, informing them when delays get in the way of your lunch or dinner plans, so they know to have a torta from Frontera waiting for you?”
“No, sir.”
“Tell me that it can at least read the forecast for your destination and place orders for weather-appropriate pants.”
“It can’t, sir.”
The CEO stared for a long time at the prototype. “So, it’s not ‘smart’ at all?”
“Well, sir,” the engineer said, “I like to think of it like this: by adding a number of attention-grabbing but ultimately unnecessary and overcomplicated ‘smart’ features, we’d only introduce the possibility for bugs and glitches. Not to mention we would have to put out different models for different phones and tablets. So, despite how it may seem, this is a ‘smart’ product, in that simplicity is smart, because it leads to ease of use and universal compatibility.”
The CEO pounded his fist on the table. “I like that! I like that a lot! Not smart is actually smart! That’s great! That’s gonna help me a lot, not just at work, but also in my personal life!”
“Actually, sir, what I said was simplicity is–”

We’re entering the time of year when everything freezes and dies and allergies are replaced by a sense of tired dryness. For some of you, this might be a relief. And yet, consider these two things: first, said dryness does nothing to dry up non-seasonal allergies, like those related to pets; and second, spring will be back sooner than you think with its pollen-thick air. And just like the smart shopper buys next year’s wrapping paper the day after Christmas when it’s marked down to nothing, so too does he or she purchase an allergen-optimized vacuum just as allergy season winds down.
And boy oh boy, does this thing suck up allergies. In fact, it “captures and traps 99.9% of dust and allergens down to 1 micron.” As a non-allergy-sufferer myself, I don’t know exactly what that means. I can tell you that, given the the word “micron” is pretty much just “micro” with an n, it sounds pretty small.
What I actually CANNOT understand is what the fuck “MultiFLEX Technology” is. I know that it “provides flexible reach for under furniture and freestanding, compact storage.” But what does that mean, exactly? Digging a little deeper, I found that the “MultiFLEX wand bends so you don’t have to, reaching under low lying furniture with ease.” So, apparently, it’s a kind of semi-flexible wand? That’s it? Seriously?

Yes, on one level, the design is simple: it’s the Meh face, or should we say, the many (meh-ny) Meh faces you see when you come to our site. It’s a button. You press it. You keep a streak going, if you want. Or else you don’t; you reserve the Meh button only to show your nonplussedness. It’s something that makes our site special, a little inside joke among you, the customer, and us.
But, on another level, the design means so much more. It’s a tribute. To us. And all we’ve done for the world of commerce. Before we came along, all was excitement, and much of it was false. Companies didn’t know that it was fine enough to be, well, fine enough. Everything had to be glorious and exuberant. But then we showed up, and we taught people that it doesn’t always have to be that way. You don’t have to worry about moving the proverbial needle. You don’t need to dial it up to a ten. You can hang out at a five if you want.

Now, most modern phones can be fully charged with between 2000 and 3000 mAh, which means even the smallest power bank we’re offering can charge your phone somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times. By that standard, you could get 2.5 to 3 full charges with a 6000 mAh power bank, and 4.5 to 5 with the 9,000.
But look, we’re not going to spend the next few hundred words talking math. It’s too abstract. The most helpful thing to do would be to provide brief profiles for who might require each power capacity, so that you identify yourself among them. Here goes:
4,200 mAh
Last time you went camping, your phone spent the entire night searching for a network it would never find. You woke up and had no juice, and while it turned out okay, you don’t want to risk it again. You need something that’ll charge your phone in case of an emergency, but you don’t need much more than that. Bonus point: you can bring it with you to work, because you work out of a truck that, strangely, has neither a USB port nor a cigarette lighter.
6000 mAh
One morning, you wake up and find a strange man standing over your bed. He explains: he’s a representative to the Corrigan Cartel, one of the most notorious crime families in Ohio. Recently, your little brother got in with them, except he didn’t make good on his promises. Now, they’re holding him somewhere, and the only thing between him and a pair of cement shoes is you. You’ve got a full day ahead of you, enacting archaic rituals and making shady transactions in a number of parks in and around Cincinnati. And let’s just say the Corrigans didn’t factor in any time for you to stop and juice up your phone. Which is a problem, because you need to be face-timing the entire time so they can be sure you don’t call the cops. In short: you’re gonna need some serious recharge power.
9000 mAh
You get a text from an unknown sender, a wrong number, you think. Or maybe it’s spam. It’s a tip on a hot new cryptocurrency. The text says it will change your life. Sure, you think with a chuckle. But you can’t help but be a little intrigued. So you follow the link to an app, and you start mining. You leave it going overnight. The next day, you wake up feeling significantly taller and stronger. You look at yourself in the mirror. Its as if you’ve been Photoshopped into a model. You find that you have an intense desire to work out. You go running and clock 18 miles easily. The next day you go further. And further after that. Soon you’re running up mountains just to get your heart rate going. You’ve made partner at the firm, which is crazy because you don’t remember becoming a lawyer. The paychecks are amazing. You’re constantly out hiking, skydiving, rock climbing, and cliff jumping. And all the while, you’ve got your phone with you, mining, draining your battery. You don’t want it to stop. You’re afraid that if it does, this will all come crashing down. And yet, you’re always setting off on some new adventure. You don’t get a chance to charge that often. You need a power bank, something with some serious mAh, in order to maintain this new reality.

Here’s the thing: if a smartphone, smartwatch, powerbank and a bunch of other things for just $99 sounds too good to be true… well, it is, sort of. Don’t get us wrong: this phone, like, works. It’s actually not that bad. But if you keep up-to-date with your upgrades and always choose the newest Samsung or Apple offering, you might be a bit less than wowed by this thing.
Then again, this sale isn’t for you. Really, it’s an intervention for the still-using-a-flip-phone crowd.
Look, it was cute for a while. You met up with your friends and a few of their friends, and they became your friends too, and at some point you took out your phone to exchange numbers, and everyone was like, “Wow! You still use that thing?” And maybe they laughed. Or maybe they were impressed, because you’d somehow managed to avoid the magnetic pull of digital progress.
But that was in 2013. Now, it’s 2018 and those same friends are texting you stuff like, “He proposed! I said YES!!!” or “It’s a healthy baby girl, 7 lbs, 12 ounces!” And you’re responding, “k,” because even typing out a simple “congrats” would take about twenty minutes. And you don’t have that kind of time. Because you’re at a red light. And you’ve gotta look down at the directions you printed out from MapQuest.
By which we mean: buddy, this shit ain’t cute anymore.

You don’t want to be addicted to the endless flow of information, to be rendered just another mindless zombie, walking into streetlights because you’re too engrossed in a stream of moth memes. You want to really experience the world, you say. And we get that. Except, pal: you’re on Meh right now, and you’ve read almost the entire write-up. So let’s tap the brakes before we judge how everyone else is using their time.
And don’t worry: this phone is not nice enough to make you seem suddenly materialistic.

Each year, representatives from all 50 European countries gather for the EuroSock Summit to discuss potential changes to the sock’s age-old design. Here is a summary of year’s Summit, which took place in Luxembourg in a chamber deep inside the Grand Ducal Palace:


The representative from Sweden proposed changing the design, so that the sock appeared strangely both modern yet antiquated, like a torture device, but also attractive and entirely comfortable. Motion failed to pass by a vote of 11 to 39.


The representative from Italy proposed making the next EuroSock as soft as the richest pillowy ball of burrata, as delicate to touch as the most sumptuous pluck-able leaves of basil, and yet as firm as tagliatelle cooked to a perfect al dente. Also: more garlic. Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 19 to 31.


The representative from France proposed making the sock from a distinct material that would grow delightfully crusty over night, so to it could be enjoyed the next day. There was some confusion over this, but eventually the representative from France admitted she was simply hungry, having been disappointed in her hotel’s bread options that morning at breakfast. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Norway proposed making the sock seven times thicker. When someone suggested he have multiple pairs of socks–some for summer, others for winter–he smiled and nodded, saying, “Yes, exactly! These would be for summer!” Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 3 to 47.


The representative from Ireland proposed making the socks out of a darker fabric, one “as pitch black as a Guinness.” The representative from Belgium chimed in to add that the fabric should be strong, “not unlike a delicious quadrupel.” The German representative also leaned forward to propose adding a pinch of sea salt, “one of the key ingredients in a traditional gose.” When they all three broke down laughing it became clear that they’d partaken in a few of the aforementioned beverages during the break for lunch. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Lithuania proposed shelving sock-talk for a bit. Instead, she suggested, maybe they should open some rakia, grappa, limoncello, champagne, or what have you and join their Irish, Belgian, and German compatriots, who were obviously having the best time of anybody. Motion passed by a vote of 50-0.


In this way the Summit ended, just as in previous years, and the EuroSock remained mostly unchanged."	0.05			2018-10-04T04:00:09.459Z	0.30652535328345804	0.94	60866

When I first saw that we were selling an air fryer, I was torn.
On the one hand, Wirecutter pretty emphatically stated that they don’t recommend these things for how expensive they are. If you’re not familiar with Wirecutter, they’re basically one of the best and most straightforward resources for when you’re buying kitchen appliances, electronics, and just about everything in between. They do a lot of research and provide simple, easy-to-understand articles replete with concrete purchasing recommendations. So, their opinion carries a lot of weight.
On the other hand, my dad has an air fryer and he likes it.
Two venerable sources. Two contradictory opinions. I didn’t know who to trust. So I began to dig deeper. Here’s what I found:


While working on his Wirecutter article, Michael Sullivan conducted more than 35 hours worth of air fryer tests. In the end, he was so unimpressed with them that he recommended buying a simple convection toaster oven to get a better bang for your buck.


Back when I was in high school, my dad used to change my car’s oil. Not just check it, mind you, but perform a full-blown change. He had a little pit in the garage, so you could pull your car right in and he’d take care of it every 3000 miles.


Given those two facts, I came to the following conclusion: it was possible that my dad had also used his air fryer for 35 total hours, yet it was very unlikely that Michael Sullivan had ever changed the oil in my car when I was in high school. This seemed like a pretty clear “checkmate” situation. But then I remembered that an air fryer’s greatest selling point is its oil-free frying. Thus, it only seemed fair that all oil-based arguments need be discarded. I found myself right back at square one.
Then it hit me: my dad is a Meh customer. He likely bought his air fryer right here on this very site. Meanwhile, Wirecutter suggests a model that retails at about $250, which is FIVE TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS ONE. Furthermore, they never say they’re outright bad; they just say they aren’t worth the money. Which makes sense: my dad would likely not be the satisfied air-frying customer he is today had he been required to fork over more than 200 bucks.
Therefore, Wirecutter, I know we’ve suggested this before, but if you’re reading this, consider an addendum to your initial verdict of “Not recommended”: something like, “unless it’s selling on Meh for almost a fifth of the cost, in which case, go to town.” I’d be happy to put you in touch with my dad if you need any more information."	0.05			2018-10-03T04:00:13.622Z	0.4058992852291472	0.92	65054		0.15524434813545068

In the grand scheme of things, I’m pretty smart about health stuff. No, not necessarily among other humans. I mean in the REAL grand scheme, as in: among all living creatures in the world. I sometimes eat too many donuts, or drink so much coffee that I give myself a headache. But I at least KNOW what I’ve done immediately after I’ve done it. And compared to my cats or my dog, I come out looking like a friggin’ genius!
For example, I won’t find my way into the trash and attempt to consume a giant wad of paper towels that were used to soak up frying oil, only to slink behind the couch and embarrassedly vomit it up. And if I found myself stuck in a bathroom, I would wait patiently until someone got home and ask them for some help. I would not, under any circumstances, try to EAT MY WAY OUT, causing enough damage so that both the door and the trim need to be replaced, and giving myself a pretty rough tummy ache along the way. Another point in my favor: I understand the utility of pills as well as the ease with which they can be taken. They don’t need to be hidden in cheese or loaded into a little plastic contraption to be shot deep into my throat in order to induce swallowing. I just take them!
And yet, even as I type these gloating words, I’m sitting in a rickety wooden chair, leaning awkwardly over my laptop. Unlike the damage of a few too many donuts or a bit too much coffee, I won’t feel the effects of my bad poor posture for many years. And yet, I know this, but I do nothing to correct it.
In a way, poor posture is like the human version of eating out of the garbage. We just can’t help it. Instead of taste-testing rotten meat or chewing on plastic bags, we hunch. And just as pets need help learning what they should and should not do, often for their own good, so do we.
That’s where this this Posture PT Confidence Corrector comes in. It can fit onto just about any chair–from office chairs to the driver’s seat of your car–and it improves posture, which in turn strengthens your core and reduces lower back and shoulder pain. Or, to put it differently, it’s not unlike a spray that makes bad posture smell like sour apples!
Okay, that’s going a little overboard with the pet metaphor thing. It’s not a spray. It’s a posture corrector. Sorry for the confusion. Now buy one, and straighten out your life. Got it?"	0.05			2018-10-02T04:00:03.835Z	0.31486252125742953	0.93	62431

Today’s sale leaves us conflicted. On the one hand, this would seem like an Order/Hoarder sale: you’re given options, some more reasonable than others. On the other, it’s not exactly the same as past Order/Hoarder sales we’ve offered. For example, there are more than two options. So, if you don’t mind, we thought we could work through this together, with a little Q&A:
How does the math break down?
This is a little more complicated than usual. You can get a 40 pack of basic fidget spinners for $14 ($0.35/spinner) or a 40 pack of LED fidget spinners for $16 ($0.40/spinner). But you could also get a 160 pack of both LED and basic fidget spinners (an 80 and 80 split) for $34. Which is about $0.21 per spinner… except, if you think about it: the first 40 basic spinners cost $14 and the first 40 LED spinners cost $16, which adds up to $30. So that’s a mere $4 for the last 80 fidget spinners, or a nickel per! CRAZY!
So then why wouldn’t this be an Order/Hoarder sale?
For three reasons:


As mentioned above, it’s not an either/or. There are three options.


40 fidget spinners will already have you well on your way to hoarding fidget spinners; but, more importantly…


These aren’t really for hoarding! We’re offering them now, because we want  to get them to you with plenty of time to spare before the end of the month. That way, you can offer them out to Trick Or Treaters on Halloween. That doesn’t sound very hoarderly at all, does it?


Why wouldn’t you just give candy away on Halloween like everyone else?
Because fidget spinners are fun and will last longer. Also, this site is run by someone from Saint Louis where some people give out jokes instead of chocolate, so it’s kind of on brand for us to eschew the national standard for Halloween practices.
Wait, back up: what even ARE fidget spinners?
They’re goofy little spinny toys with no real purpose other then to be fidgeted with.
That’s sorta dumb, isn’t it?
You might think so, but in a world where people try to sell peppermint-scented oil as an alternative to physical therapy, I find it refreshing that there’s a product out there that’s explicitly for useless goofings-off.

First, this is some pretty classy jerky. Therefore, the price tag isn’t going to be exactly in line with the Slim Jim that you buy on a whim as you check out at the grocery store, only to open it in your car and for the noxious smell to make you regret your decision, although not enough to stop you from eating it. Hypothetically speaking. Point is: this is good jerky and good jerky costs money.
Second, and more importantly: we need to make something EXCEEDINGLY clear. We saw @djslack’s suggestion and considered it, but the decision to sell the jerky ultimately came down to us and us alone. In fact, there’s a chance that we subconsciously were thinking about selling jerky and so @djslack didn’t exactly give us the idea as much as surface it.
What we’re saying is: we’re not necessarily in the business of outsourcing our product selection. As in, we don’t do requests. As in, don’t get used to this, okay? Because this is it. The party ends here.
We say this because ever since we sold some toothbrushes as a joke–that’s right, it was a joke! A joke ON YOU!–we know there have been rumblings on the forums about something you’d like us to sell. That’s how obstinate we are, people: we won’t even name the item. We won’t even write the word. Because we are unmovable.
We’re like a brick wall. People always tell us that. They say, “Talking to you all is like talking to a brick wall.” Which we take as a compliment concerning our strength. And also our attractiveness, given that brick is a very beautiful building material. In certain cases, at least. Maybe not in some of the suburban architecture of the mid-fifties. But then again, those homes have a certain nostalgic beauty in a way. There’s a pure American warmth to them, isn’t there?

Thus, in order to know what the site is, all you’ll need to do is follow a wide variety of publications that cover the following: computers, electronics, kitchen appliances, vacuums, cameras, photography, automotive innovations, home and garden, just home, just garden, cellular accessories, flashlights, salt lamps, culinary interests, pillows, snacks, fashion, lawn maintenance, DIY home improvement, carpentry, wiring, construction, cameras again, etc. That way, you’ll see our press release announcing our new venture. As well as new hires.
Because we would essentially need to build an entirely new team, wouldn’t we? Otherwise, it’d just be a gimmick. And besides, I don’t want a flashlight expert telling me about trowels or copper pans or robot vacuum cleaners. No, we’d have to start from scratch every day. And in the event that something sells out, we’d probably have to have another site. A site of nothing. A sort of meditative anti-consumerism zen space with no purpose aside the absence of all shopping. Which would also need a whole new staff. That would need to be hired midday and let go by the next morning…
Okay, you know what, we’re going to take these thoughts back to the idea room and think this through a bit further. In the meantime, what you can do to help is buy some flashlights!"	0.05			2018-09-28T04:00:10.030Z	0.31179265788250815	0.94	69975

Dearest Professor Alba,
First off, a hearty congratulations on winning the Henning Prize. Your self-adhering bow-tie is certainly a masterwork, and the award is absolutely deserved. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the ceremony. As I am sure you are aware, since my expulsion, you are my sole correspondent from the Meyer Institute of Alchemic Fashion. But my choice not to attend is not due to some fear of seeing my former classmates and teachers again–or, more accurately, of experiencing their fear as they witness me. No, I cannot attend because I have fallen ill, and I fear this may be the last letter I ever write.
Although, perhaps ‘fallen ill’ is a simplification, as the illness under which I suffer has no name.
The trouble began in my makeshift lab late one night. I was working on a new stitch technique, making minor tweaks to it here and there over the course of several weeks. It was going nowhere, and after one particularly long day toiling in the haberdashery (with no Meyer Certification, I am forced to do such menial labor), I came home so exhausted and angry that I decided to throw it all away in favor of something entirely new.
I am sure you will be disappointed to hear this. During my expulsion hearings, you were the strongest voice in my favor. When the administration said that I “endangered” all those around me with the “diabolical recklessness” of my work, you told them it was just a phase. But Professor Alba, it was not. And while I am not proud to admit that, I am also not exactly not proud either.
For that evening, in my lab, I created something amazing: a stitch unlike any other stitch; a stitch that seemed to take time into it, that seemed to steal tiny slivers of the universe’s fabric and convert them into pure style. It was a stitch that resembled a stitch in only an ethereal way, like a word in another language whose definition we can on some level understand but for which there is no direct translation. I sewed up some pairs of socks with the stitch; despite using bland monochrome fabrics, each pair came out patterned with a bold unpredictable design.
I learned all too late that it was taking something from me as well, that it was essentially draining my life energy, weaving it among each sock’s seams. I fashioned a lead coat to wear while working, but it was too late. The damage has been done. I write this letter to you from bed, Professor Alba, a bed from which I fear I may never again rise. Indeed, just the act of writing has left me pale and exhausted.
But this is not a letter merely bidding farewell to you and this world. You will find, in the envelope, the detailed plans for the aforementioned stitch (as well as for the protective coat). I cannot say what I want for you to do with them. Some days I hope you will set them aflame and think of them no more; other days I hope you will use them to start a line of vibrant and delightful socks to sell around the world.
But, Professor Alba, promise me this: if you choose the latter, make sure to warn the people, to let them know the truth, that these are not simply stitched socks.
With Eternal Gratitude,

Step 2: Apply ass to chair. (Optional, recline chair or use ottoman to extend legs).
Step 3: Apply blanket to lap and/or legs.
Step 4: Apply purring cat to blanket at lap area. Pet cat occasionally.
Step 5: Apply hand to remote; locate a binge-worthy show on your television; press play.
Step 6: When your significant other or roommate enters the room and asks if you’re really going to spend all day just sitting there watching television, sigh and say, “You’re right,” then move (very slightly) to get up, stopping only to hiss with pain and grasp at the injury area where the first aid was administered. (Optional: parlay sympathy, if shown, into your significant other or roommate bringing you a hot beverage of your choice: coffee, tea, cocoa, or apple cider.)
Step 7: When your significant other or roommate leaves the room, replace purring cat (if riled by your attempt to get up), rewind show as needed, and resume viewing.

Overview: Very good, but not as good as Michael Keaton!!!
Before I get into my review, I want to give you a little bit of background: I’m a huge Michael Keaton fan and a software developer. Recently, I sold my start-up to a large tech conglomerate for several million dollars. I used that money to build a bunker inside an abandoned warehouse where I would live and wait for Michael Keaton to arrive so I can ask him a few continuity-related questions about his seminal 1996 comedy, Multiplicity, for my podcast: The Podkeast. I won’t list the questions here because I am certain they’ve never been asked and I want to be sure I’m the ones who asks them (more on this below, when I get into the complaints).
I need peace in my bunker to record episodes of The Podkeast and also to meditate and prepare myself for the eventual interview. Luckily, it’s soundproof. That brought up another issue, though: if I can’t hear anything, how will I know when Mike (that’s what I call him in my head sometimes) has arrived?
That’s where The Lynx 1080P Camera comes in! The quality’s great, they’re easy to set up, there’s free cloud storage, and most importantly, it has facial recognition. Using photos, I trained mine to only recognize one face: Michael Keaton’s. Thus, I’ll get a check-in notification whenever he arrives (fingers crossed, any day now!). Any other unfamiliar face alerts that come through I just ignore, because like I said, I don’t need the distractions.
I should say: I do have two complaints. One is that the Lynx recognizes faces really well, but not always the material said faces are made of. What I’m getting at is that my mom keeps showing up in a really realistic Michael Keaton mask (she probably bought it with the start-up money I gave her, ugh!). She always says the same thing: that she’s worried I might be losing my mind. It makes me want to scream. Like, of course I’m losing my mind! I got a check-in notification and thought Michael Friggin’ Keaton was here! And sometimes I do scream. Hey, it’s a sound-proof bunker, gotta get your money’s worth, right?
The other complaint I have is that Michael Keaton has not shown up to do the interview with me. This is probably more a don’t-have-Michael-Keaton’s-contact-info problem than a Lynx problem, but still: with that AND the mask issue, I didn’t feel right giving it five stars.
Overall, though, a very good camera!"	0.05			2018-09-24T04:00:11.601Z	0.2044531578210335	0.94	74861

When it comes to celebrating milestones, different people demand different amounts of ceremony. Some will require you to wear tuxedos and dinner gowns to the their wedding in a restored factory-turned-theater-space, wherein they will prepare a choreographed song and dance commemorating the various defining moments of their relationship. Others will go to the courthouse, sign a few documents, and send a text imploring you to meet them for beers later.
Whether it be a birthday, a successful defense of a PhD dissertation, or a housewarming party–everyone’s a little different. Not everyone wants gifts. But herein lies the one consistent rule, regardless of an event’s formality: if you’re bringing a gift, you have to put it in something festive. Because even the most casual soon-to-be mom isn’t going to stoked when you show up with a onesie still in the shipping box from VintageOnsiesRUs․com.
The problem? Wrapping is stressful. Wrap a gift poorly and you look like a degenerate. Wrap a gift too ornately and you seem like a bit of an over-achiever. Besides, not everything is easy to wrap. If you want to wrap an overstuffed plush starfish, you can either a) put it in a box and wrap that, or b) get your friend who’s an aerospace engineer to help you get the measurements and scissor placement just right so that it doesn’t come out looking like garbage.
Really, your best bet is to put that overstuffed plush starfish into a gift bag. Because the gift bag always looks good. It’s as fun-looking as wrapping paper and as easy as a shipping box. Plus, getting a gift in a gift bag rules. You’re basically getting two gifts, one of which you’re more than encouraged to regift later when you need to give someone else a gift.

You’ll notice that you have two choices on today’s sale. One is reasonable. The other is unreasonable. Or should we say: the other is an UNREASONABLY GOOD DEAL! You know what that means. It’s the return of:
ORDER/HOARDER
For those are unfamiliar, Order/Hoarder is when we offer you two options: a normal number of things for a good price, or an abnormally large number of things for a GREAT price. Today’s product:
Cooling towels!!!
So, let’s break it down:
The Math
“You can’t put a price on cool.” That’s something someone said in a movie once. It doesn’t matter who or what movie or if I just made it up, because it’s not true. You can put a price on being cool.
For example, if you just want to be double-cool (as in, get two cooling towels) you have to pay $12. That comes down to the totally reasonable per towel price of $6 (especially considering they’re $10 over on Amazon).
Now, here’s where it gets a bit more complicated. As we like to point out on these sales, when figuring out the price per unit of the Hoarder order, it’s not as simple as dividing the overall price ($36) by the number of units (12). BECAUSE, your can choose either 2 or 12, no in-betweens. Therefore, if you think about it, you’re already paying $6 for each of the first 2 towels, which means the last 10 towels are only costing you $24, or a mere $2.40 per towel! How about that deal, huh?!
What you can do with a normal order
It’s pretty simple. Cooling towels are not exactly all that, well, cool, but they are functional. With just two of them, you can use one as your main post-workout cool-down towel, and give the other to your spouse or partner. Or you can cycle through both yourself so you don’t have to do laundry as often.
What can you do with a Hoarder order
So much more! Here are just a few suggestions:


Go a day early and leave a cooling towel at each mile marker of your upcoming 20K race, so you never have to worry about getting too hot.


Take all of them and fashion them into a suit or cocktail dress to wear to outdoor weddings. But would a suit or dress made out of cooling towels really be classy enough for something like that? you might ask. To which we would respond: Could it be any less classy than a suit or dress soaked with sweat?


Sure, you could spend a bunch of money on an air conditioner and then a bunch of more money each month to run it. Or, you could save some cash by sewing yourself a delightful cooling towel quilt!


They’d make a great napkin alternative at your 12-guest “super spicy food banquet”.


Are you a do-gooder teen? Do you often dream of fashioning rope ladders out of clothes and blankets to lower yourself out your 2nd story bedroom window so you can run around after bedtime with your new rebellious friends? Only, your palms get so sweaty that you can’t get a good grip? Gosh, if only you could make a rope ladder out of something cool and soothing to the touch!


See? Maybe we were wrong. Maybe 12 cooling towels isn’t an unreasonable amount of cooling towels at all. On the other hand, you still have the option of buying the (completely boring) 2-pack. The decision is yours!

Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a child. Let’s call him @Dave. Dave wore Sears-brand Toughskin jeans. They were, as their name implied, durable and long-lasting. But, like most economically practical things, corners needed to be cut to keep them affordable, and, unfortunately for Dave, the corner Toughskin jeans cut was the let’s-make-these-things-look-cool corner.
Or maybe not unfortunately. Because Dave rarely felt self-conscious in his Toughskin jeans. What did make him feel self-conscious was when, in the mid-80s, his grandparents splurged and got him a Generra sweatshirt. It was “in.” Very “in.” In fact, you could say that it was so deeply “in” that the brand couldn’t find its way out of the decade.
Suddenly, all the other kids at school were stopping Dave in the hallway to say, “Cool sweatshirt,” and, after years of remaining invisible behind the Toughskin curtain, he didn’t know how to react to such a compliment. It was uncomfortable.
Dave has come a long way since then… or has he? No, he doesn’t wear Toughskin jeans anymore, but he still has a Toughskin mindset. He’s not afraid of bright purple laptops or speakers that are loud in both function and design. This, in some ways, is his calling: espousing the virtues of things that don’t look exactly like you’d hope but work just fine.
But he doesn’t exactly know what to do with these slick-looking Rowkin Bluetooth Ear Buds.
Does he say: just because Meh sells some stuff that has substance but lacks style does NOT mean the stylish stuff we sell lacks substance in equal measure? Does he point out that many of the negative reviews on Amazon that have driven the average rating down to an unimpressive 3 stars can be put into 3 categories:

people complaining about the hefty (non-Meh) price tag;
people who struggled with a weird issue that was corrected easily by a factory reset; and

As we’ve mentioned before, we recently won an auction for a storage locker that was filled entirely with branded content romance novels. Or so we thought. But, picking through the titles, we actually found many belonged to a branded content epic fantasy series by the author L.L.R. Holdien about a warrior named Tarklaw The Powerful. Luckily for us, there’s a chapter in book 19 about today’s product, the Keysmart (and Keysmart Pro).

Having successfully freed the shape-shifting wizard Vintel, son of Filor The Great, from the floating prison of Delkabana, narrowly escaping the light-spears of the Meschlen Guards by leaping through a portal leading somewhere that only a seer like Wise Crin might intuit–Tarklaw found himself deposited into murky waist-high water.
“Vintel?” Tarklaw called out, trying to locate the wizard whom he had just a moment ago saved, despite their families’ centuries-long acrimonious relations.
“I’m right here, Tarklaw,” Vintel seemed to whisper into his ear, buzzingly. “As a shape-shifting wizard, it is my custom to acclimate my shape to the environs, and so I have taken the form a mosquito because we, bitter-family-enemy-turned-savior, appear to be in a swamp.”
“Not just any swamp! The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors!” came a voice that belonged neither to Tarklaw or Vintel, but another in their vicinity. Tarklaw turned quickly, drawing his great sword with a shing sound common of sword-drawing. But he found only a small creature not unlike an unshelled tortoise, swimming towards them. “Forgive me for startling you! I am Rewn, peaceful leader of the Melorians, the primary inhabitants of this swamp at the edge of the Planet Glor at the far reaches of the Heplan Galaxy. Now, I imagine you’ve come here through some pesky portal or other, but fear not: your exit is easily made through one of the Eight Astounding Doors.”
“Doors?” Said Tarklaw. “I am from the planet Phentalon, a place without doors, due to our peoples’ openness with each other.”
“Very noble,” Rewn said. “Perhaps one day, The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors shall be like that. For now, you must choose one. They go to any number of worlds, from the euphorically beautiful mountain-scape of Relan to the hellish fire-deserts of Dumask. And we have all the keys right here…” Rewn dipped under the water for a moment, but re-emerged with a perplexed look upon his creaturely face. “Oh, dear! They were right there a moment ago.”
“You simply allow all keys to be strewn throughout a swamp?” buzzed Vintel.
“Not exactly,” Rewn said, explanatorily. “We keep them all together using an ingenious contraption known as a KeySmart. Made of aircraft aluminum, it can hold eight keys–or as many as fourteen, with an expansion pack! Additionally, it includes a loop for keys belonging to vehicles propelled by motors. Not to mention, its extended frame can hold long or foreign keys, which is especially important to us, as one of our oldest and most prized keys is made from the hollow bird-like finger bone of the fallen Hilderan Mage Lazlorn.”
“But,” Vintel buzzed, contrarily, “as ingenious and organizationally optimized as that all sounds, it seems at present not to be helping in your ability to locate them.”
“Ah, yes, that would be true if it were the base model, which is still good,” Rewn said. “Luckily for us, we opted for the Pro. Not only does it have a built-in LED flashlight and bottle opener; it can also show a map of your missing keys, and by way of the Tile app–which can be accessed via your smartphone or tablet–you can make your keys ring out loud! Of course, I should add at this juncture that the ‘water’ here in the The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors is different in elemental makeup to that of the water on other planets, such as Earth.”
“Are you saying,” Vintel buzzed, clarifyingly, “that just because we are discussing the KeySmart Pro being used in a water-based situation, it should not be taken as an endorsement of it being waterproof?”
“Exactly,” cried Rewn, disclaimingly.
“Much like doors, smartphones and tablets are concepts foreign to my home world,” Tarklaw said. “But that sounds like a great functional product nonetheless.”
“And I will show you just how functional it is!” Rewn cried with excitement. He brought forward a device and opened the Tile app. A moment later, a ding rang out, though it sounded muffled. The three of them turned… and stood facing a giant glowing snake-like beast. It emerged from the water, standing nearly forty Glorian theltans tall, or forty feet tall in Earth measurements, Glorian theltans being exactly equal to terrestrial feet. The ding sounded again, from somewhere deep inside of the monster’s abdomen.
“Oh no! A Mirelord! Run!” Rewn cried with fear. “Or, better yet, swim.” And with that, he disappeared under the water.
But Tarklaw did not swim away. He crouched into a combat ready position as best he could in the deep murky water. The Mirelord leaned closer to him, its eyes alight with evil.
“What are you doing?” buzzed Vintel into his ear, questioningly.
“We must get out of this swamp,” Tarklaw cried. “This is the only way. Though, it will be hard for just the two of us to defeat it…”
“Perhaps, I can help?” came a distinguished voice from Tarklaw’s side.
Tarklaw turned, and saw… no! He couldn’t believe it! “Hinton, son of Raquille, wielder of The Great Axe Of Orlagos, and best friend since birth of Tarklaw The Powerful? But I thought you were–”
“The immortal prisoner of the Inter-dimensional Pirate Lop, locked away in the his ship, The Pummeling Ewlok, for all of eternity?” Hinton laughed. “Not a chance in Dumask, my friend! Now, what do you say we free the aforementioned product from the belly of the beast? Just like old times?”
Tarklaw couldn’t help but smile. “Just like old times, indeed,” he said, and they raised their weapons to the approaching Mirelord."	0.05			2018-09-19T04:00:10.856Z	0.34612555704581827	0.93	72268

One time, I left without remembering to close the door.
I was living in a house somewhere so rural we didn’t need to lock up, and, in a rush to leave (I was going on a trip), I forgot to swing the door all the way closed, leaving only the screen door between my cat and freedom. He was fine. My mom checked on him the next day and, much to her surprise, he emerged from under the deck after spending what must’ve been, for an indoor cat, a terrifying night outside.
Just about every time I have left the house since then, even if just for an hour, I have wondered: “did I close the door? Did I lock the door? Do the pets have food? Do they have water? Did I leave the oven on? Did I unconsciously light seven candles and place them precariously close to window curtains that are, unbeknownst to me, highly flammable?” Many times, I have gone back to check. Never have I left the stove on. Never have I found candles flickering. The pets have always been fine. Only once or twice have I found the door unlocked.
Still, I never regret it, because it’s nicer to know everything’s fine than it is to hope everything’s fine.
And that’s really what these Zmodo MeShare cameras are for: making sure. You can call them “security cameras,” but that feels a little overstated. Maybe it would be better to rebrand them as “check-in cameras.” After all, the chances that you’re going to tune in as your home is being burglarized–thus allowing you to call the authorities while the burglary is in progress–is very low. I mean, hell, the actual likeliness of your home being burglarized at all is very low. And if your first thought upon reading that is, Nuh-uh, my home gets broken into all the time, we won’t argue with you. But we will say: you probably need more than a couple Zmodos.
Otherwise, these are a good option for the second-guessers out there to quell all the concerns that might flare up during your day at work: whether you just want to make sure everything’s fine, or to check that you didn’t forget to close the windows, or to monitor whether your dog is feeling okay after eating something stupid that he wasn’t supposed to…

The second thing you need to know is that the backs velcro on, and the seats have magnets in them, which makes them “infinitely configurable.” And yet, if that’s the case, then why is are these proposed layouts so BORING?! They’re mostly just couches. Where’s the fun in that? Why not try something more exciting, like these three designs:
You’re Number One

Will anyone even see that it’s a #1? Probably not. Is it really a practical way to lay out a room? No. But the subliminal reassurance that the design will provide for your child is massive. Every time they sit down they’ll think, “Hey, you know what: I’m special!” And this confidence will push them to do great things.
Game Room

Checkers is simple and boring on a board… but what about in a room, with you and all of your friends as the pieces? To make it more exciting: institute a rule where it’s not as easy as just “jumping” another piece; instead, you have to battle for it. Whoever doesn’t get cast into one of the empty spaces (i.e. onto the floor) wins!
Soft Kitchen

Okay, this isn’t exactly innovative, design-wise. But in terms of utility? Think about it: you cover the floor of your kitchen, wall-to-wall, with Sactionals, and now, suddenly, you can drop a glass or a ceramic mug and it won’t shatter! Plus, they’re machine washable, in case there’s a spill. Best of all, if you need to keep an eye on something you’ve got baking, you can just lay down next to the oven and watch it!

Dear @reclaimercube,
On September 2nd, you posted the following comment on a knife sale:

Meh I have anxiously been awaiting for you to post a toothbrush for sale again. I will post this everyday until you finally sell another one again.

And, @reclaimercube, can we tell you something? We’re very proud of you. Because you kept your word. Since then, each day, you’ve put forward this same request.
Your fellow Meh customers began to notice. One post from Friday, September 7th sparked a discussion that involved more than 20 comments. In that conversation, someone pointed out a toothbrush for sale on a competitor’s site. You, ever strong, refused to take the bait:

not a bad deal… But not on meh so it doesn’t matter. You could link me to colgate’s website or crest’s website for a free toothbrush and I still wouldn’t want it unless it was on meh. I’m chaining myself to this statue. Ride or die mehbrother.

Your repeated request did not specify why you wanted a toothbrush, or what kind of toothbrush you wanted. Really, you haven’t even promised that you’d buy the toothbrush. You’ve only asked, repeatedly, for us to “post a toothbrush.”
Well, good news, @reclaimercube: when we launched Meh, we made a decision. Once, and only once, we would allow a Meh customer to dictate exactly what we’d sell. The only rule was they had to make the request for 13 consecutive days. They could ask for $1 MacBooks, or free puppies, or Cadillac Escalades filled with cash. It didn’t matter. There were no restrictions, aside from the 13 days. Some of us worried the financial hit would be too much, but others felt assured: we could trust our customers! They wouldn’t make unreasonable demands!
So thank you, @reclaimercube; you’ve shown us that our faith was not misplaced. Now, Meh community, let’s all come together and celebrate with this build-your-own-bundle of toothbrushes.
Sincerely,
Meh

Hair: it is the ultimate example of disobedience.
You can train puppies to pee outside, to walk next to you, to sit, to shake, to do any number of fun and/or useful things. With cats, the job is much harder, but with some persistence (and a spray bottle) it is possible to enforce a few rules: you do not yowl in the middle of the night, you do not walk on the kitchen counter, you do not knock our decorative trinkets off the mantle as a game. Even a bonsai can be coaxed, over time, to grow a certain way.
But not hair. Nope, no matter how many times you comb, shave, style, epilate, and wax: it can just never take the fucking hint!
You know that person in your  your life who’s like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “hmm, maybe?” And you hope they’ll just drop it, but then a day later, they’re like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “I don’t know if that dumb thing is really a good idea.” Which should be clear as hell, but they don’t want to listen, so they keep prodding and prodding until you’re like, “Look,  I don’t want to do the dumb thing because it is dumb, and honestly, I’m worried you might be dumb for suggesting it, and I might be dumb for being the friend of such a dumb person.” And you feel terrible but they just smile and say, “C’mon! It’ll be great!”
That’s hair. No matter how many times you try to send the message that you don’t want it to come back there, it keeps coming back there. It is untrainable!
Or is that the wrong way to look at it? Could it be that we are the untrainable ones? That our hair is not being a stubborn learner but a tenacious teacher? That it wants to lead us to a better place? A place where we eschew the standards of beauty thrust upon us? Because isn’t it pretty arbitrary where we say there should be hair and where we say there should not? On the head is good, but not on the face? Except some faces capable of growing thick enough hair? On the chest is okay, but no, never on the back? Not on the legs, but okay on the arms, except in the armpits? Could it be that our hair’s persistence is its way of saying: you need to get the hell over it and just be who you are?

The three brothers had been cleaning out their grandfather’s basement for nearly two hours before they found the FoodSaver.
“What’s this?” said Kyle, holding it up.
“Looks old,” said Jake. “I’d guess circa second half of the 2010’s.”
Terry took it from Kyle and inspected it. “Wait, I know these things. It’s an early model weed-sealer. You know? The devices for vacuum-packing weed so it wouldn’t go bad.”
“All this talk of weed remind me, have you guys taken your three o’clock edibles yet?” Jake asked.
Kyle and Terry nodded.
“But wait,” Kyle said, “why does it say FoodSaver on it, if it’s for weed?”
“You have to understand, Kyle, this was before weed was legal everywhere,” Terry explained. “They didn’t even put it in the water back then!”
Kyle looked at the FoodSaver perplexed. “Really?”
“I’m serious,” Terry said. “So people weren’t as acclimated to it as we are now. They considered it a drug. Thus, when people took some, they got ‘high,’ which basically meant they thought without logic. So it’s likely that the inventor of the ‘FoodSaver’ only named it such because he was super high, and probably pretty hungry.”
“So strange to think that the same substance that keeps us calm and measured, used to have almost the opposite effect!” Kyle said.
Now Jake had the FoodSaver. “Are you sure this is a weed-sealer? To me, it looks like an early sous-vide-assistant. That would make more sense with the FoodSaver name.”
“Did they even sous vide back then?” Terry asked.
“Sure,” Jake said. “It was more of a luxury, though, given that it was before the Microwave And Oven Act of 2035.”
“When I read about those times, and all the negative-energy-pollution caused by those now illegal kitchen appliances, it just makes me sick,” Terry said.
“Guys, you’ve got me thinking…” Kyle paused to gather his thoughts. “Well, you know how when we put stuff in the freezer, it just freezes together and gets covered in weird ice?”
“They’re called water diamonds, Kyle,” Terry said.
“They mean the moisture has accepted the food, so we know it’s safe to eat,” Jake said.
“I’m well aware of them and what they mean. Don’t forget, I’m the one who studied health at Dove For Men Presents: College. But I was thinking, the food doesn’t always taste good after the water diamonds form.” Kyle took the FoodSaver from Jake. “And I know this is going to sound crazy, but if this thing could keep weed fresh, and be used with food products for sous-vide purposes, maybe we could combine the two functions. Like, we could use it to seal food before we freeze it so it stays fresher longer.”
“You mean, you want to eat food that’s been frozen but hasn’t emitted its proper water diamonds?” Terry said.
“Isn’t that illegal?” Jake added.
“Sure, on Earth. But not here,” Kyle said, “on Mars.”
Jake and Terry had to admit he had a point: they definitely had been on Mars this whole time."	0.05			2018-09-13T04:00:05.184Z	0.21097046413502127	0.92	62121

As someone who doesn’t brush his hair much, Wet Brushes look, to me, like normal brushes. But looks can be deceiving. Or, in this case, the looks are deceivingly simple.

The Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet is pretty simple: it’s a wallet that comes with a powerpack, which can be used to charge your phone or other devices.
In a way, to recharge something is to refill it, but unfortunately, while the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet does fill your wallet in the literal sense–like, there is a powerpack inside of it–it can’t refill your wallet in the figurative sense–as in, recharge your bank account.
Or can it?
Because think about this: what kind of phone is the most likely to have a short battery life? An old phone! And maybe you have an upgrade waiting for you, but you don’t want to dish out the money for one. Because maybe, with your provider, it’s not as simple as handing over $200 and getting a new iPhone. Now, you pay for the upgrade via a small increase in your monthly bill–a small increase that over time accumulates into a lot of money. And it’s very possible that this change was made because people like you: people who buy a phone and then ride it into the ground, thus spending a couple hundred bucks every six years, rather than evert two like your cell company–let’s call them Werizon–would prefer.
And so now you’ve got a geriatric phone that needs a pick-me-up every few hours to make it through the day, and you’re not always near an outlet, so one of these Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallets–‘wallets’ plural because you get a 2-pack–is just what you need. It’s your wallet, so it’s not like you’ll forget it. Thus, you’ll always have some charge on hand, which means you don’t need to upgrade, which means your phone bill won’t go up, which means you’ll save money, which, in conclusion, means the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet can, in fact, recharge both your phone and your wallet!

I remember being a kid, riding in my parents’ car at night, and dropping something. Maybe a toy or a quarter. It doesn’t matter what. What matters is I reached up and turned on the dome light to find the object in question. And it was then that my dad freaked the fuck out. You would’ve thought I’d tossed hot acid in his eyes. “Turn that off! I can’t see anything!” he claimed. He might’ve even swerved a little, for emphasis. As a dutiful child, I switched the light off as quickly as possible to avoid careening off the road into a ditch.
Flash forward some years: I have a license. I have a car. A friend is riding with me. He turns on the dome light for something and… everything is fine.
The same thing happened the first time I helped jumpstart a car. I’d been told so many times about everything that can go terribly wrong that I felt sure that it would end in a) an deadly storm of electricity and fire; or b) one or both of the cars being fried for good. Turns out, if you, ya know, just follow instructions, it works out fine.
If anything, the greatest risk of jumping a car–the one that no amount of how-to articles or Youtube videos can save you from–is the risk of wasting a favor. Because think about it: you spend all that time being a good friend and building up positive equity until you’ve almost got enough to cash in for pet care or help shlepping some furniture from your old apartment to your new one… Then your car battery farts out and now your buddy is driving over in the cold to help you get it started again.
That’s where this iJoy Jump Starter Kit comes in. Not only will it charge your phone and provide some you with some light; it’ll make it so that you don’t need to dip into the favor bank just to get your car running.

Another super villain attacking the city, another mad rush downtown. We newspaper photographers are the real heroes, Roy thought to himself with a chuckle as he ran from the Gazette office into the mayhem, clutching his camera to his chest.
It was a joke, of course. Roy didn’t think he was more heroic than the Scarlet Savior. But he could relate to her in one way: like her, he never had any help. After layoffs there were just two of them in the photography department; they outsourced the rest. And it just so happened that whenever disaster struck, Lorraine was rushing off to take care of “a personal issue.”
What a coincidence, Roy thought. Always trying to get out of work! Then something else occurred to him: was it possible that Lorraine was, in fact, the alter ego of–
A taxi honked at Roy as he sprinted across the street toward the sounds of lasers and maniacal laughter a few blocks away. “Watch where you’re going buddy!” the diver yelled.
“I’m working!” Roy yelled back.
“Yeah, yeah,” the driver said. “Well, we’re all working too. Working on staying alive in this damn city!”
Roy laughed. Not at the man but at the theory the honk had charitably eradicated from his mind. Lorraine couldn’t be the Scarlet Savior. Sure, they both had striking red hair, but the Scarlet Savior always wore a matching Treasure Island jewelry set–one necklace, one bracelet, both made out of genuine gemstones and pearls–whereas Lorraine wore a single longer Treasure Island necklace, which was also made of genuine gemstones and pearls.
Well, that settles that! Roy thought. And just in time too! Because here she came, the Scarlet Savior, flying through the sky, blazing a red path through the sky that, strangely, looked like it originated on the roof of the Gazette’s offices.

We’re dropping the price of both but not by the same amount: for the one with multiple zippers, the price will be just a buck lower, whereas, the single-zipper version will be a whopping $5 less than last time. For those keeping score at home: that’s now a $9 difference between the two.
In some ways, this isn’t simply a sale; it’s an experiment. We want to answer the question: what is a zipper truly worth?

There are three potential outcomes to buying this Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk:
Outcome 1
You buy the standing desk. You’re intrigued by its promises of a stronger core, healthier circulation, improved productivity, and better posture. But the truth is, you don’t care for it. You’ve spent your entire life believing that getting work done requires sitting down and shutting up. So how do you expect, as an adult, to change your working position? Maybe if you gave it more time… but you don’t want to. You just want to use it as a normal desk. And that’s fine! Because this thing didn’t cost north of $600 like some models out there; it cost less than $200. And look, that’s not nothing, but it was a worthwhile gamble.
Outcome 2
You love your new standing desk. But it’s not enough. Once you taste the thrill of working upright, you want more. You quickly replace your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk with a treadmill desk. You start out walking, but soon enough you’re outright sprinting while you manage your spreadsheets and respond to emails. You get a kiddy pool and set it up behind the treadmill, filling it with a medley of pirañas and water moccasins. Now, any slowdown and you’re in trouble. But even that’s not enough. You take out the water moccasins, extract their venom, and put it in an IV that runs directly into your arm. The anti-venom is in another IV that you’ve rigged to only administer as you meet your hourly sales goals. Your friends and family members are worried about you, but you’ve never felt more alive! And it all started with the Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk!
Outcome 3
You get your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk, and you like it. You crank it up to standing height for a few hours of the day; for the rest of the time, you use it as a normal desk. You’re neither disappointed, nor unsatisfied. It meets your needs, and you will use it for the foreseeable future.

Shaving is the blandest and yet most grueling task of every personal grooming regimen. It is a zero sum game: you can put it off, but that only means it’ll be a longer and more grueling process when eventually you do get around to it. It’s like mowing the lawn, except without the exercise, and the smell of fresh cut grass replaced by the noxious chemical odor of shave gel. In short, it’s miserable.
Or it was. Until now. Enter these “Famous Maker” razors. Famous Maker? you say. But who IS the famous maker? That’s just the thing, we can’t tell you. And now suddenly, shaving is an act of immeasurable mystery and excitement!
Could it be that these razors are the excess produced by an underground razor factory located far below Park City? Perhaps for the original purpose of being distributed, in secret, to the agents and publicists and personal assistants of actors in town for the Sundance Film Festival? So that these various agents and publicists and assistants could sneak into the actors’ hotel rooms at night and shave their faces clean while they slept? Because maybe the actors, having escaped the always-on environs of Los Angeles, wanted to let themselves go, but the various men and women whose livelihoods relied on their pristine image had other things in mind?
Or could it be that the razors are from a different hidden factory, a facility built into the side of one of the Alps? For a baron? A baron who volunteered to host the worldwide beard and mustache contest at his expansive villa? While harboring a secret hatred of all facial hair? And so the plan was not to celebrate these growers of elaborate beards and mustaches, but to trap them and then use the razors to, as the baron said in a private correspondence, “reveal their cheeks upper lips once again to the world”? Maybe he even wanted to shave the hair on their head too, just to prove a point? Only his scheme was discovered by the lowly helper-boy tasked with taking his correspondence to the post office? And so the baron had no choice but to sell off his stock of razors in an effort to cut (pun intended) his losses?
Or could it be a pretty basic story of a razor company having some leftover razors that they wanted to offload? Only they couldn’t do so under their own name? Because then people would be like, “but wait, I just spent this much on these at the store, but now you’re selling them for cheap online? That’s bullshit!”?
Okay, for purposes of whimsy, let’s just ignore that last scenario. Instead, focus on the first two, buy these razors, and shave with an entirely new sense of intrigue!"	0.05			2018-09-05T04:00:15.298Z	0.26119278036366067	0.93	62903

Can I level with you here: I’m just not much a knife guy. I have a set of good kitchen knives and that’s about it. I open boxes with my keys cut through frustrating packaging with a pair of scissors. I don’t mean any judgment. I’m just being honest. The problem is, I have to write about this knife, and I can’t just say, “Uh, I don’t know? It’s fine, probably?”
Or so I thought…
Then I went to do some research on Amazon and saw a question about what material was used to make the pivot washers and how thick the blade is. The first answer reads as follows:

Sorry, this was a gift for someone in Arizona so I can’t answer your question. I can only say that the knife is substantial!

Wait, seriously? This is allowed? Admitting that you don’t know the answer… counts as an answer?! Well then friends, I’ve got some great news: I can answer all the questions you have about this 2-Pack of C.R.K.T. Ruger Go-N-Heavy Compact VEFF Serrated Knives! Let’s do it!
So, how thick is the blade?
Great question! I’d guess that it’s probably about the same as other knives like it, although it could be thicker. But even then, it wouldn’t be too much thicker, because that would be weird, right?
I’m reading that it has a “stonewashed drop-point blade.” That sounds intense. What kind of stuff can you use it for?
I bet it would be pretty good at cutting through most stuff you’d use a knife like this for, but I don’t feel comfortable naming specific stuff because I’ve never used one. I will say this, though: there’s a good chance it can cut through butter. And an even better chance if the butter has been left out of the fridge for a little while.
Was it designed by Bill Harsey?
Sure was! As to who Bill Haresay is, lol, idk! I would venture to guess he does something in the knife industry.
One reviewer says that it is 11.8"" long when it’s extended. Is that longer than other knives?
Not sure. It is definitely not as long as a foot, because a foot is 12"". With that being said, another reviewer posted a photo of it next to another knife and a tape measurer, if that helps. It is bigger than the other knife, but not the tape measurer (which is good, because those things can get really long).
Wow! This is so easy! It’s great to finally realize how much a knife expert I really am! Thanks Amazon question answerer, for showing me the way.

This Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble may seem simple enough. It’s 6 100% ceramic products with matching designs: a toothbrush holder, a tumbler, a soap dish, a lotion dispenser, a tissue box, and a trash bin. None of these things require much explanation. What does deserve some attention, though, is the multi-stage process that one goes through when deciding to buy one or all of them. We’ve laid it out below:
Stage 1: Intrigue
These are interesting. The various pieces look stylish, and they all match. It might be nice to have a motif that really brings the entire bathroom together.
Stage 2: Skepticism
But do I really need any of these? The old coffee mug we put the toothbrushes in works just fine, as does the little wicker basket we’ve got for trash. The sink already has a built-in soap dish. This one would be easier to clean, but do you really need to clean something when all it does is hold soap? Isn’t soap itself essentially the concept of cleanliness made solid? Lotion bottles already come with a pump top and tissue boxes are their own tissue dispensers, really. Am I supposed to re-package things? Isn’t that adding unnecessary steps?
Stage 3: Re-evaluation
Yes, I guess technically it is adding unnecessary steps, but all in the service of style. And maybe that’s worth it. Which would maybe mean the steps aren’t unnecessary?
*Stage 4: Introspection
And what does it say about me that I’m so put off by these objectively simple tasks? Like, it isn’t hard to empty some lotion from one thing into another thing. It isn’t hard to put a box of tissues inside another box. Or clean a soap dish. Just like it isn’t hard to put a new bag in the garbage after I take the trash out. But I never do, not right away at least. I always wait hours, sometimes even a whole day, leaving paper towels and granola bar wrappers on the kitchen counter, until finally my desire for a clean surface outweighs my laziness. At which point I put a new bag in the garbage can and am reminded that the laziness was all to avoid something that takes mere seconds. And yet, when next I need to take out the trash, this process will repeat. Making matters worse: someday it might not just be taking out the trash. Someday it might be dirty diapers I’m dealing with. It might be taking kids to the doctor. It might taking the medication I need to stay alive. And when that time comes will I just attempt to put it off? I want to say no, that I’ll be past all of this by then, that I’ll finally be a responsible organized adult… but an I’m adult now, damnit! I should already be better than this!
Stage 5: Ascension
That’s it! No more! I’m going to buy every item in this Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble, not just because it’s stylish and will tie my bathroom together nicely! No, that’s all secondary. Really, I’m doing it to prove to everyone–but especially myself–that I’m capable of taking the right steps and building good habits! New me, here we come!
Stage 6: Regression
Purchase made! Now, it’s time for bed. Shit, wait? It’s trash day tomorrow, isn’t it? I should take the bin to the curb. Although, there really are only a couple bags in there. I’m sure I’d be fine until next week…"	0.07			2018-09-01T04:00:01.758Z	0.3734081588603498	0.94	49783

There’s an old saying about innovation: “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.” It is derived from an Emerson quote that reads: “If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.” In this way, the saying is an example of itself; the ‘mousetrap’ variant is shorter, snappier, and conveys the exact same meaning, thus it is the one most often used.
The implication here is basically if you build it, they will come: you’ll have lines around the block, people from all over frantically waving their bills in the air demanding the latest in mouse-entrapment technology.
The truth, we know now, is a bit different.
The world, upon beating a path to your door, would say, “This mousetrap is smaller and more humane than the previous mousetrap, but now I’ve decided I want a mousetrap that is smaller and more humane.” Or, “I have no mice in my house, but many spiders, and this mousetrap did not catch a single spider, which is a bit of a disappointment.” Or, “Excuse me, I have some ideas for how you might make this better mousetrap–which is a good start–into an even greater mousetrap, despite the fact that I have never myself built any mousetrap.”
And so it goes with the Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Pack. You can put it in the microwave if you need heat, or you can put in the freezer if you want it to be cold. The ceramic beads heat and cool with the gel, providing a nice texture, which one Amazon reviewer says, “makes for an easy massage.” But the title of that review–“slightly different than the norm”–is telling. It implies that the incorporation of a heretofore never used component is something slight. Innovation, people seem to believe, requires a total redo.
Yes, some reviews expressed issues with durability. That’s understandable to call out. A few wished it would be more pliable when frozen. Again, fair.
But then there are the other “complaints.”
One says: “The only drawback I’ve seen so far to this item is its size. For the most part, I don’t think the size will be an issue because it’s probably rare to treat an area larger than 6x10”.""
Just so we’re clear: the only issue this reviewer could foresee would arise in a scenario that they couldn’t foresee arising.
Another–in a review titled “Does the job but not much better than competition”–claims: “the problem is just like every other reusable gel back I’ve ever used: they simply don’t remain truly hot or cold enough for long enough to do a good job. They’re more warm or cool than they are hot or cold for much longer.”
To put it differently: the biggest problem with this product, in this reviewer’s experience, is endemic to this entire product category, not just this product, and relies upon a universal tolerance of hot and cold temperatures.
The point of all this is to show that people will always find things to gripe about. And maybe they’re right. Still, it seems like the best case scenario is that you really love the texture of the ceramic beads inside the gel, and the worst case scenario is that you get three of totally passable hot/cold packs for $18.

Here we go again! The return of The Skeptics Choice, our occasional write-up segment wherein we read what a product claims to do and say, “hmm… I don’t know…” Today, we’re talking about a PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser. Follow along, won’t you?
The Claim
For all those who are thinking that we’ve been through this all before, fear not: this is a different kind of diffuser than the one we sold last time. This one is a “one-of-a-kind product combines the therapeutic properties of a pure Himalayan salt rock lamp with the soothing aromatherapy of an essential oil diffuser.” Apparently, it sets “the perfect mood for relaxation at home” and provides “all the benefits you would expect from this powerful combo.”
The Skepticism
That last part is a little presumptuous. All the benefits I would expect? I understand each word in the phrase “Himalayan Salt Lamp” on its own, but I know nothing about what they mean when they’re put together. But that’s no bother! It’s all laid out right there in the marketing copy:


The first benefit is that it will “help boost your mood.” And honestly, that sounds legit! When you’ve had your windows shut for almost 12 consecutive months because it took just a single day for the seasons transition from the bitter cold of winter to the brutal humidity of summer, something that makes the air smell pretty can be a nice little pick-me-up.


The second benefit is that it can “increase energy levels.” This seems a little more like bullshit than the first claim, but it’s vague enough that I’m willing to give it a pass.


The third benefit is that it will “neutralize the positively charged ions that emit from electronic devices like smartphones, televisions, radios, and more.”


Umm, what the fuck? That sure escalated quickly.
Seriously, the difference in hysteria levels from “it might boost your mood” to “it’ll protect you from killer ions” is about equal to the difference between a “hang in there, kitty” poster and one of those spam posts from MySpace that was like, “Post this on 10 of your friends’ profiles or else your eyes will fall out.”
And by the way, I’m not against a lot of this stuff. Crystals are fine. Astrology is fine. You could argue that it’s unscientific, but that’s missing the point. Life sucks sometimes. If getting some stones to put in your pocket makes you feel less like you’re flying a cloud of chaos towards an inevitably disappointing conclusion, more power to you! I watch groups of men in polyester play what is basically an IRL-board game involving sticks and balls on an enormous grass-and-dirt field, and if the group of men I like outplays the group of men I don’t like, I feel profound happiness. So, I try not to judge people for the things they use to pass the time.
But I will ABSOLUTELY judge anyone who preys upon someone based on those things. Because that’s what they’re doing here. They’re not saying: “you like this thing? we make this thing~” They’re saying, “we make this thing! it is DANGEROUS not to have this thing!!!” In other words, it’s taking something that should be a distraction from the chaos of daily life–which it totally could be, by the way: it’s cool looking; it lights up; it smells nice–and turning it into part of the chaos of daily life. And that’s messed up.
(Also, sorta tangential but still relevant, it’s problematic in a whole other way: What’s dangerous about technology is not that it’s pumping the air full of ions; it’s how intrusive it is. For example, did you know that if you say “Bloody Mary” three times into your smart phone, an ad for “great local brunch spots” will appear on your Facebook timeline? Our devices are definitely listening to us. We can all agree on that, right? Fine, maybe I’m just being paranoid. But you have to know that every Google search, every purchase, every photo you post is being mined for important data. And so making it a conversation about “ions” is pushing it in a direction that helps no one but those selling PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffusers.)
The Conclusion
If you want a thing that lights up and looks cool and smells nice, this is a good investment. If you’re thinking about buying this because you’re afraid to breath in all the electro-turds you released into the air while binging Sharp Objects, maybe open a window?"	0.05			2018-08-30T04:00:02.770Z	0.20794343938448737	0.93	60935

1.

I’m a lawyer, but right now, I’m not in the courtroom. Instead, it’s late at night and I’m in my office, wearing Ray-Ban glasses, poring over all the evidence of this grueling case, trying to find something to prove my client is innocent. All the older lawyers at this firm didn’t want to take my client on, and I’m starting to see why, but then again, I’m a young perky go-getter. Sometimes I worry that I’m too concerned with upholding justice, that I get too wrapped up in what’s right and wrong, that I fall in love with too many of my clients. But I can’t think about that now. I need to squint through my Ray-Bans at this piece of paper, then dig out another piece of paper and squint at that one, before realizing I’ve found it: a small but pretty obvious detail that proves my client wasn’t there that night. Thanks, Ray-Bans! I couldn’t have done it without you.

2.

I’m a bit of a nerd. You can tell because I’m always wearing these thick Ray-Ban frames. Also, I’m always doing nerdy things like taking notes in class or carrying a lot of books. Sometimes I drop them, to the delight of cheerleaders and jocks. My best friend is quirky and outgoing, but I am not. I have a figure that would require a nutritionist and hours of gym time each day to maintain, but you can’t see it under these bulky sweaters that I wear, while sitting in my bedroom listening to non-aggressive indie rock or reading an obscure book like Wuthering Heights or The Collected Plays of William Shakespeare. Perhaps someday, someone will move here from out of town and crack this high school’s social hierarchy wide open, but until then it’s just me, my one quirky friend, my books, my sweaters, and my Ray-Ban glasses.

3.

I’m what you might call a savant. I’m always doing things like solving unsolvable math equations, or going to the park and playing five games of chess at a time… and winning. The crisp lines of my Ray-Ban frames are definitely in stark contrast with my wildly disheveled hair! Can I tell you something? I wasn’t surprised to see the government suits show up at my house. What did surprise me was when they took me to the research facility and showed me what they found. I stared at it for a whole a minute. Then I dramatically took off my Ray-Ban glasses, wiped them on my shirt, and stared at it for a minute longer. I didn’t know what I was looking at. What I did know was that, despite being just a guy from Queens (with the IQ of a Nobel laureate), I might save the world. Strap in, Ray-Bans! This is going to be a long ride!

Dearest Meh Customers,
Apparently, our minds cannot be trusted, and for that we are sorry.
You see, in our previous attempt to sell these M Cushions, we misinterpreted a few things. By which we mean, we mistook several vague comments about the massager being applied to unnamed areas beyond the back to mean…
Hmmm…
How do we say it exactly?
Let’s try this: we thought you were implying that the M Cushion could be applied to places where the combination of friction and heat might bring about sensations not unrelated to relief, but a step beyond relief, a sort of deep relief that goes by many names, one of which it shares with a term from film and literature meaning the culmination of the story’s drama.
But, um… apparently we were a little off-base. As one quoted commenter noted:

I swear I didn’t mean it in a sexual way. I just meant after leg day you can lean back in bed and use it on your aching thighs rather comfortably.

Time to dive into our library of branded content romance novels, for a tale of secrecy, royalty, and grilling. Please enjoy these excerpts from Coals Aflame by Criminy Highlater.

Grilling with one tool? Mary had gotten used to that thanks to her Starfrit Tonglite. In many ways, she was a lot like the 6-in-1 bbq multi-tool: she was strong, she had many skills, could do many things, and, since Eric had run off with his secretary a year before, she relied only on herself.
Which was what she planned to do that Saturday afternoon. Her work at the non-profit, helping troubled youth gain acceptance to Ivy League schools, didn’t leave her much time for making friends, so she would do it on her own. She would take a cooler, her little grill, and her Starfrit, and she would go from her apartment in Soho to Central Park to have a little cookout for one. It would be simple… or so she thought.
“M’lady, if I may have a word,” came a voice soon after she’d set up. Mary ignored it, thinking it sounded so British and refined that it must be coming from someone’s radio. But when it persisted, she looked up.
An austere and very handsome man stood in front of her.
“There you are,” he said. “I couldn’t help but gain sight of your grill, and I wondered if I might bequeath you of a favor?”
Mary had gotten good at doing things alone since Eric left, but there was something interesting about this man, something that made her desire his company.

The man said his name was Collin, and he worked for the a mysterious member of the royal family, Prince Nigel. Mary remembered seeing on the news that Nigel was making his first visit to the United States. She hadn’t listened to the story, because she’d been distracted by the strange mask the prince seemed to wear everywhere.
“What kind of work do you do for him?” Mary asked.
“All sorts,” was all Collin said.
“And so what can I help you with?” Mary asked.
“Well, being among the prince’s central envoy, I am privy to many of the finest restaurants in the world, but I don’t always want to partake in such luxury. And I was hoping you might allow me to dine with you, to take in a true American meal!”
“That’s it?” Mary asked. “You want a burger and some hot dogs?”
“'Tis my heart’s desire,” Collin said with a winning smile. “And if it would please you, I’d be happy to help. For example, perhaps I will unpack the remainder of the tools you require for grilling?”
Mary smiled and held up the Starfrit. “I only need one!”

Mary flipped burgers with the spatula when the upper arm was drawn back and rotated hot dogs with the tongs when the upper arm was extended. She opened them each a bottle of beer with the opener. “A fine colonial ale!” Collin said. Mary laughed, using the Starfrit’s serrated edge to cut the buns.
While they ate, Mary asked, “So is Prince Nigel really as eccentric as he seems?”
“You’re asking about the mask, I presume?”
Mary blushed. ""Well, I–
Collin laughed. “It’s no issue. It’s what everyone wants to know: why is he always wearing that strange masquerade mask, the one behind which he has hidden since his youth? Is his face disfigured? Is he some sort of lunatic? But the truth is, he simply desires privacy. He doesn’t want to be followed everywhere he goes.”
Mary opened her mouth, ready to say that this made sense–that she could not imagine what it must be like–when suddenly the sky went dark.
Nearby people screamed. Collin grabbed her hand, fearfully. “My god, it’s some sort of unpredicted total solar eclipse! Not even my royal astronomer saw this coming!”
Mary switched on the Starfrit’s flashlight, which she usually only used for convenient nighttime cooking.
“What do you mean ‘your’ royal astronomer?” She asked. She pointed the flashlight towards him, then towards his arm, and down to wear his hand still held hers. She felt a rush of something she had not felt in some time, not since Eric.
But then, the sun came back. Mary turned the light off and set the Starfrit down. Collin quickly stood. “I’ve just realized something, something very important,” he said. “Blast, I have so much bloody work. I must be retreating, but perhaps we could meet later? For another ale?”
Mary nodded. Collin named a bar–a dingy sports bar on the East Side–and a time. With that, he was gone. When Mary went to pack up, she couldn’t find her Starfrit anywhere. Which was a shame, as its scraper feature certainly would’ve helped her to clean her grill.

Mary waited at the bar, nursing her beer. The televisions were all turned to the baseball game, with the sound way up. Occasionally, a promo for the evening news promised coverage of Prince Nigel’s visit as well as the strange lunar happening of the afternoon.
“Who cares,” Mary mumbled to herself. Collin was late. Of course he was! He probably wasn’t coming. Another near-miss with love, she thought.
Just then, the feed cut out from the baseball game. “We interrupt this broadcast to bring you, a statement from Prince Nigel the Third.”
There he stood, the man in the strange mask. Mary laughed. He looked so silly. Then he spoke.
“Good morrow, our friends from across the pond,” he said.
Mary felt herself go rigid. She recognized that voice! But no, it couldn’t be. Could it?
“Collin?” she said, as if he could answer her through the television.
“It has been lovely visiting your many museums and areas of historical importance,” the prince went on. “But it was none of them that taught me the most. It was a single person–a single woman–who showed me the true American character, one that is not afraid of multiplicity.” He held up the Starfrit; Mary’s breath caught. “I’ve learned that, like this tool, Americans can do great things, many different great things, and are not as easily categorizable as they seem. And like this tool, they can do wonders at a grill.”
The crowd broke out in laughter in applause. Cameras flashed.
“Now, I may have more to say on this later. But right now, I must be going. I need to return this to its rightful owner. I fear I may even be late!” Just as quickly as the address had begun, it was over. The baseball game returned.
“Anyone sitting here?” a woman said to Mary, indicating the seat next to her at a bar.
Mary smiled. “Yes,” she said. “Or I should say, he’s on his way here now.”"	0.07			2018-08-25T04:00:01.567Z	0.3806925754768836	0.9	53347	0.020357891736731745

When you see an 8-piece cookware set like this–which is really a 4-piece cookware set with a lid for each item–there’s likely an image that comes to mind.
You see yourself standing at the stove, each of the four burners occupied by one of the pots or pans. Perhaps a sauce simmers in one and water comes to a boil in another for pasta that you rolled yourself. You’re sautéing some garlic and onions in yet another, and not with a spatula; instead, with just a flick of your wrist you are cycling it through the air like they do in cooking shows. In the final pan, you brown your steaks before moving them to the oven, where they will cook to a perfect medium rare.
But this image is a fantasy. You can’t actually manage cooking four precise things at once. Honestly, if your stove had only one or two burners, it would work just fine. It might free up some counter space for dealing with the onions you forgot to mince until after your butter had already melted (and burned) in the frying pan.
Thus, purchasing four pots and pans all at once is not necessary, but it is aspirational. You need to keep the dream alive, of wowing your friends and family members with perfectly balanced 4-part meals that make use of descriptors like “deconstructed” or “molecular” or “done three ways.” To have only one pan or one pot would be to admit defeat, to shut the door on your glorious dreams.
In the meantime, great news: you can make your signature “pasta a la butter and a handful of shredded cheese” in one of these just fine! And if you want to make the same thing tomorrow, even more great news: you don’t even need to do the dishes because you’ve got three other cooking vessels just waiting for a turn!"	0.05			2018-08-24T04:00:01.907Z	0.23620242900706845	0.93	59918

In school, you only wore your backpack on one shoulder. When that shoulder started to feel sore from carrying your entire load of books, you shifted it to the other shoulder. This should’ve been all the proof you need: that the most efficient way to wear a backpack is by using both arm straps. So why didn’t you? Because it didn’t look as cool and nonchalant as the single strap technique.
There are more examples: pocket protectors are nerd-wear, despite serving what is actually a pretty useful function. And for all the work automobile manufactures put into building incredibly efficient engines, for a while it seemed like they couldn’t design a hybrid that didn’t look like some sort of weird robo-ladybug.

Whoa. Got a bit deep there.

Dearest Anthony,
It is with a heavy heart that I compose this letter. When you return from your stint with the touring company, you will find me gone, and while we will always be brothers, I will no longer be welcome in our family’s house.
As you might suspect, father discovered my designs. He left for the park to perform his troupe. It was a production of Twelfth Knight, and while he had mentioned that it had been adapted for sock puppets, he made no indication that such modifications involved a shortening of runtime. Thus, I thought I would have nearly three hours of uninterrupted work time. When he arrived home just forty-five minutes later, he found me hard at work on my makeshift drawing table.
Now, I know what you are thinking: why did I not simply lie? You instructed me to do just that when I first confided in you about the designs. But Anthony, I have been lying all my life. I attended L’Academie Royale De L’Art Textile to study sock puppeteering at the age of fifteen. The instructors told me I could emote more with my wrists and palms than most classically trained thespians could with the whole of their bodies. I graduated at the top of my class and received invitations from several of the most renowned touring companies. I traveled the globe. By the age of seventeen, I had performed for two kings and six queens. But it was never what I wanted. I didn’t want to be a sock puppeteer like father and like all of our uncles, like grandfather before them, like you.
And I told father so. When he found me at my drawing table and asked what it was I was scribbling, I confessed everything: that the pretense under which I had returned home–to found my own sock puppet theater–was untrue; that I wanted no longer to act with socks but make my own socks, socks that, in their design alone, possessed as much vibrant life as could be instilled by a skilled sock puppeteer.
Father did not appreciate this, of course. He scoffed at my plans. He told me that out there, beyond the cardboard walls of a sock puppet theater, socks were not lauded but ridiculed. He said there was no such thing as a vibrant life-affirming sock out there. He said they were simple and drab, a mere treaty between foot and shoe.
Moreover, he said I have two options: I must either cast my designs into the fireplace and resume my pursuit of sock puppetry, or forever be banished from his house. As the opening this letter has surely confirmed, I have chosen the latter. I will be traveling far away from here, all the way to the Americas.
So, fare thee well, brother. While it is unlikely that our paths will cross again, perhaps someday you will be in clothing store and you will see a brand of exciting colorful socks with my name upon them and know I have lived my dream.
Yours,
Ezekiel"	0.05			2018-08-22T04:00:07.337Z	0.3287164649283502	0.94	61717			0.03937749319454194	0.07019466178157474

Today’s Order/Hoarder product:
WWE TeenyMates!!!
What we’ve got here are some little mystery grab-bags containing cute-ified versions of your favorite (or least favorite) WWE wrestlers. As with each of these Order/Hoarder sales, we like to provide a little math breakdown: for $5, you can get 8 packs of them, which comes out to 63 cents each. On the other hand, you could get 64 packs for just $20. That’s 31 cents each, right? WRONG! Since you can only order 8 or 64, the first 8 cost $5, and the last 56 cost $15, which means those last 56 are costing you just about 27 cents each! That’s one quarter and two pennies! And when you consider that each pack contains 2… that’s less than 14 cents per wrestler!
And if you’re like, “why would I need 128 of these things?” here are a few helpful suggestions:


Put a bowl of them at the end of your desk at work, and if anyone asks you why, just say, in as condescending a voice as possible: “It’s healthier to hold a tiny wrestler than it is to eat candy.”


Give them away at your kids’ parties. Do you kids and their like wrestlers? Great! They’ll love these things. Do they not like wrestlers? That’s okay too. They won’t know who any of these people are and you can just call them L’il Fun Buddies or something.


Isn’t it about time your little Christmas village got some extreme new residents?


Glue them to your dashboard and let them intimidate you into being a better driver.


Carry them around with you and conduct a social experiment called: how many random people on the street will catch a little wrestler when you say to them: hey you, catch this little wrestler?


You do realize it’s only 71 days till Halloween, right?

Let’s just get right to the basic question here: what is so damn smart about these Smart Stands?
“Smart” has come to be synonymous with “online” or “connected to wifi.” But these Smart Stands are neither. They are an amalgamation of plastic and hinge. There is no voice control or app so you can manage it while you’re on vacation or built-in analytics to tell you how you might best use it in the future, based on your past trends. They just sit there and holds up your tablet or phone.
And maybe in that way they’re the smartest of “smart” products: because they’re smart enough to know what they do well, and also to know what they don’t need to do.
The past is a veritable web of failed innovations. Just like no one wanted pasta from Panera or personal pizzas from Subway, nobody’s pining for some bullshit half-functional beta-level technology to do something that was already extremely simple. Being “smart” is not just creating new complicated functions to prove you can; it’s pausing before you do all the work and asking, “Wait, why are we doing this? Is this actually necessary?”
But you know who didn’t skip that step? Smart Stands. They asked, “Why?” And they said, “Because sometimes you want your tablet to be up like this rather than down like that.” And then they asked, “Should we go further?” And they decided: “No, because the further we go, the more we risk losing our greatest asset, which is that our stands are universally compatible with all phones and tablets.”
See, sometimes intelligence is knowing when to stop and say, “Good enough for me.” Which is why these smart stands are good enough for you, no matter what kind of device you prefer."	0.07			2018-08-19T04:00:02.021Z	0.46941764127665553	0.94	53660			0.024072699552649

Yes, we mentioned the blender bottles sale from a couple Saturdays ago in yesterday’s write-up, but we were mostly talking about the bottles themselves. Today, we’d like to talk about the sale.
See, that sale was an experiment. We offered two choices: a rational number of bottles (the 4-pack) for a good price; or an irrational number of bottles (the 16-pack) for an even better price, with no middle ground. We wanted to know, could we bait you into making a totally ridiculous purchase just by making you feel like you’d gotten a ‘great deal’?
The answer, in a fair number of cases, was ‘yes!’ And so here we are again.
Now, before we get to the product, we need to name this as-of-today recurring sale type. Some ideas:
The Excess Express: Because like an express train, there are few stops between where you should go and the end of the line!
DTB: Does it stand for “Down to buy”? Nope! It’s “Direct to Basement.” Because you don’t need to pretend you’re actually going to use all this stuff! Take one out, deposit the rest downstairs with all the other stuff you thought was a good investment!
Any or Many: Pretty self-explanatory. Other option, along these lines: “More or Less.” Other other option, along these lines: “Deal or Mo’ Deal.”
Irrational Numbers: Are these deals really that much like the mathematical concept of irrational numbers? Yes–because the logic of either is hard to explain–but also no–because only one of them will make you feel smart.
(Also, hello nerds, who are right now gearing up to compose some long screed in the comments about how, well, actually, it’s not that difficult at all to explain irrational numbers!)
Anyway, you can vote on those on today’s poll (and give your own suggestions). Who knows! Maybe if this works, we’ll have a whole spin-off site where do only this kind of deal! Eh?!
As for today’s product, here’s some info: they’re power banks, so it’s not exactly as impractical to have a bunch of them as it was with the blender bottles. Also, we sold something that looks like these before, with the shoe sole pattern, but these are the 6000mAh version, whereas last time they were 9000mAh. On the plus side: that means they’re smaller. On the downside: that means they have less charging capacity (each one can carry enough power to charge the average phone about 3 full times, rather than 4 with the other version).
But really, what’s important is THE DEAL! Because think about: at 2 for $12, that’s $6 per power bank. Not a bad price at all. BUT if you opt for 10, and assume that the first 2 cost $6 each, that means the last 8 cost just $24, or a mere $3 each! And if you go deeper and consider that each of those 8 is rated at 6,000 milliamp hours, that means that you’re only paying $0.0005 per mAh! And $0.0005 is basically nothing, and a lot of nothing is still nothing, therefore, WE’RE PRETTY MUCH GIVING THESE THINGS AWAY!
Okay, maybe we kind of flubbed up the logic there. But the question remains: do you want a boring old 2-pack of Xsories 6000mAh Power Banks for $12 or an amazing 10 for $36?!"	0.07			2018-08-18T04:00:05.333Z	0.3572084668612603	0.93	53049			0.024494294870486415

You probably saw the word “blender” and the word “bottle” and thought, why do I need this thing when I just received my 4 or 16 pack of blender bottles? But the products are actually very different. For example, the blender bottles we sold before were both blenders and bottles, whereas this is a blender that comes with two vessels for blending that are themselves bottles.
Or, to put it differently:
The blender bottles are bottles that can blend things inside the bottle, whereas this is a blender that blend things inside one of the two bottles that come with it (or more than two, if you order more than one blender, in which case, you simply need to multiply the number of blenders you order by two to ascertain the number of bottles, which again, are not blender bottles, but bottles that work with this blender).
But here’s the thing: even if you ordered the blender bottles, you can still order this blender and bottles, because the blender and the blender bottles (not to be confused with the bottles that come with the blender) can be used together (although, obviously, the blender and the bottles it comes with can be used together too). See, blender bottles we sold a couple weeks ago, having only a small metal ball rather than a blade or a motor (like this blender has), aren’t really great at being blenders, but they are good at whisking things (so maybe they should be called ‘whisker bottles,’ although on second thought, maybe not, as that sounds like something altogether different and unappealing).
Point is, you could use the blender–this one, the one with a motor and a blade–for more intense blending jobs, like making a fruit smoothie. Then, you can pour the smoothie from the blender’s blending bottle into a blender bottle and take it with you wherever you’re going, so that you can whisk it back together if it settles.
What we’re saying is that what you should really do is buy this blender and two bottles and then pour the things you make in the blender’s bottles into one of your blender bottles, while using the bottles that come with the blender just for the initial blending.
Unless you didn’t buy the blender bottles. In which case, disregard the above."	0.05			2018-08-17T04:00:10.364Z	0.30912710887561573	0.94	60832

Well, this is a first from our branded content romance novel collection: a teenaged paranormal love story! Please enjoy these excerpts of The Heart Races Until It Rests by Annborny Hilledale.

Ellie met Henri while running.
She was not looking for love. When she’d quit the cheerleading squad to join cross-country, her boyfriend Brad, the quarterback of the school’s football team, dumped her because her running gear didn’t look “as hot.” She was relieved more than anything. She was a senior and she had decisions to make: did she want to go to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Oxford, or one of the other ivy league schools she’d gotten into?
Really, Ellie wanted to got to a small liberal arts school and study poetry, but it wasn’t up to her. Both her mother and her father were founders and CEOs of very powerful companies, and they’d both fought so much about whose company Ellie would eventually take over that they’d gotten a divorce. The only thing they could agree on anymore: Ellie had to study business.
Her Polar Heart Rate Monitor beeped helpfully to let her know her heart rate had risen above her optimal zone. Ellie often ran too fast when she got anxious about the future.
She slowed down, which was when the boy appeared at her side. ‘Appeared’ because Ellie hadn’t seen him approach. “Good day!” he said with a smile. He looked about her age but also–Ellie couldn’t exactly describe it–almost sepia-toned? He wore a strange antiquated cotton shirt and cotton shorts and his shoes appeared old-fashioned, with almost no support. “The name is Henri. I’ve just begun to undertake the task of what I’ve heard referred to as ‘cardiovascular activity’ and I was wondering if you might allow me to accompany you!”
Ellie looked at her Polar Heart Rate Monitor again. Its easy-to-read screen let her know that she’d reached her workout goal for the day. “Sorry. I’m actually just wrapping up.”
Henri looked at his shoes, disappointed. “I understand,” he said.
“But tomorrow,” Ellie heard herself say. She didn’t know why. There was something interesting about him. “I’ll pick you up at your house and we’ll go for a jog. Where do you live?”
“Just past 229 Healy Street.” Something seemed to occur to Henri. “But upon a secondary thought, t’wouldst it be possible to meet right here?”
Ellie agreed. The plan was set.

For all his grandstanding about not understanding ‘cardiovascular activity’ Henri never seemed to get tired. They talked the whole way about classic poetry. Henri was very familiar and spoke about the poets in a funny way. Like with his look, Ellie couldn’t exactly place the strangeness of his tone except to say it seemed that he often spoke as if he knew the poets personally. She chalked it up to an affect, of which Henri had plenty!
“What is that strange jewelry you wear?” he asked at one point.
“This? It’s my Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Its convenient display makes it easy to track my total calories burned per session as well as provide a weekly training summary.”
“Is it expressly designed for this very activity?”
“Nope! It’s great for biking, circuit training, or even just walking. Here do you want to try it on?”
“Oh, that’s not necessary–” Henri started to say, but Ellie had already stopped and slipped it off her wrist. Had this all been a ploy to take his exceedingly pale wrist into her hand? Did she have a growing desire to touch him? Perhaps, but Henri seemed uncomfortable, and they ran the rest of the way in silence.
Later, when she uploaded the data easily to her free profile at polarpersonaltrainer.com by way of her Polar Flowlink, she noticed something odd. The data for her run was there, but around the time she put the watch on Henri, all heart rate readings went blank.
“Huh,” she said. “Must be an issue with the monitor.” But her Polar Heart Rate Monitor had always worked flawlessly before…

It kept happening. Each day, the Polar would continuously display her own heart rate, and when Henri would wear it for the second half of their run–something Ellie insisted on, as a means of testing its functionality–there would be no reading.
But she didn’t know how to tell him something was wrong. Just as they managed to remain in the optimal zone for burning fat thanks to the Heart Rate Monitor, so too did it feel as if they were always in the optimal zone for conversation. She could tell Henri anything and he seemed to understand: about her parents, about her college decision, or about her day at school (from which he was conspicuously absent).
Finally, one day she couldn’t help it.
“Henri,” she said. “I need to tell you something. I’m in love with you.”
“And I need to tell you something,” Henri said. “Ellie, I’m a ghost. The ghost of Henri Olson, a long forgotten poet who died in his teens.”
Ellie should’ve been surprised, but somehow she wasn’t. “So that’s why your heart rate never showed up.”
“Alas!” he cried. “But if it could, it would read a number so high, as just the sight of you sets me aflutter! You see, I have unfinished business, Ellie. I have never felt love.”
“Never?”
“You must understand: it was a different time when I was born. We weren’t worried about heart rates. If we could have such a glorious device as that Polar when I was growing up, it would not measure calories but risk of scarlet fever. In such a dangerous time, can one ever feel true love? I say no, despite writing so many poems about it. But with you Ellie, well I’ve been trying to deny it. To admit so much would be to finish my unfinished business…”
“Just kiss me,” Ellie said. She leaned forward with her eyes closed and their lips met. She tasted no salty sweat on his lips, despite that the Polar Heart Rate Monitor said they’d really been pushing themselves. But of course she wouldn’t. Ghosts didn’t sweat, not even beautiful ones.
In the moment before she could open her eyes, Henri whispered: “Ellie, I love you.”
Ellie found herself alone on the road.

The dean of the English department at the small idyllic Halpern College ushered Ellie into his office. She didn’t wear her Polar Heart Rate Monitor because she was afraid her rapid nervous heartbeat would set off an alarm.
“It’s quite unusual,” the dean said, “for a freshman to win our annual award for gothic poetry, but the imagery you’ve presented–of the final kiss, of riding your bike past his supposed address and finding a graveyard, all of it–it’s just so lovely. Such a wonderful imagination.”
“You could call it that,” Ellie said.
“So I’m pleased to say, as your reward, we will purchase any book for the library in your name. Now, don’t be afraid to take some time to think it over–”
“The Collected Works of Henri Olson.”
The dean cocked his head to the side. “I don’t think I’ve heard of him?”
“He died very young,” Ellie said, pretending to rub her eye to wipe away a tear. “But he–I mean, his poems–they were really quite lovely.”"	0.05			2018-08-16T04:00:03.517Z	0.23418002803322968	0.94	61944

Friends, before reading further, lock your doors, turn on all of the lights, and gather your pets and loved ones tight, because the following is a horror story.
We begin with a young man. Let us give him a name. Let us call him Sean.
This all happened some years ago, when Sean was just a naive young man who believed, due to being brought up in the Northeast within proximity to a certain corporate food chain, that donut shops could be relied upon for iced coffee. It was this misunderstanding that will ultimately lead to our story’s tragic end. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Sean, walking the streets of Seattle on a hot summer afternoon, entered a donut shop–not one of the fancy ones you may have heard of; a small, out-of-the-way place that will remain nameless–and asked the man behind the counter, “Do you have iced coffee?”
The man replied, “Yes, we have iced coffee.” Or no, that’s not it. That’s not it at all. What he said was: “Yes, I can do iced coffee.”
This should’ve been the tell, the sign that something was amiss and Sean should flee that donut shop. But he ignored the portents. He removed a small bill and said, “Great, I’ll have an iced coffee then.”
What happened next is almost too gruesome to put into words.
Almost.
The man behind the counter took a large styrofoam cup, filled it with ice, and proceeded to pour hot coffee from the pot directly over it, handing Sean, to his horror, a lukewarm watery mess.
But do not grieve for Sean. Do not shed one single tear over his ruined attempt to seek cold caffeination. For Sean is a complex protagonist, and he is not without blame here.
Because why was he even seeking to purchase an iced coffee in the first place? Why was he not buying beans in bulk and then using this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Bundle to make his own deliciously smooth and delightfully cheap iced coffee at home? Perhaps, if he had, the day before, loaded up the 1.6 qt. cold brew carafe–or the bottle, which he could’ve carried with him–he might have avoided such a cruel fate.
As is the case with many stories of terror and woe, this is a cautionary tale. Do not, dear reader, make the same mistake Sean made. Buy this bundle and live forever in cold coffee bliss."	0.05			2018-08-15T04:00:09.341Z	0.31881841989687204	0.93	65238

It’s about halfway down the feature bullets to these Medical Forehead and Ear Digital Thermometers that you see this:

“JUST ONE BUTTON to press. No more fear of breaking a glass or swallowing mercury.”

And you’re reminded that there was a time when, in the name of health, we put a glass tube of an extremely dangerous chemical into the mouths of children.
Children.
Children who might heave their favorite toy across the room just to see if it can fly. Children who eat the erasers on the end of a #2 pencil because it looks like gum. They were given a tube made of glass–the most satisfying of all smashables–filled with a weird, perhaps even delicious-looking, red substance.
Kids these days have it easy.
Or do they?
My mom, a nurse, always had a cupboard in the bathroom stocked with the most up-to-date medical paraphernalia. Therefore, we had a digital thermometer from the beginning. It was nice. Like this one, no mercury. Like this one, an easy straightforward digital readout of your temperature. Unlike this one, it took what felt like a half-hour to give a final verdict on whether or not you’d reached that magical realm north of 98.6 and earned the day off from school. And so, it wasn’t uncommon for the temperature-taker to put the thermometer in the child’s mouth and then walk away to take care of something else, allowing the child freedom to manipulate, through a variety of means, the final result.
This is hypothetical, of course. I would never have done such a thing.
(Oh, and also, just an FYI: that whole 98.6 being the average human temperature thing is the result of tests conducted by one doctor using a crummy armpit thermometer in the 19th century and is mostly bullshit.)
These thermometers, meanwhile, can register a temperature in seconds from the mouth or the forehead, thus disallowing for any alteration of results.

On day one, we sold a Roomba. That was in July, 2014. In the last 5 months of that year–our first 5 months of operation–we sold 5 more Roombas. We sold one or two in 2015. Since then, nothing. No more Roombas…

What’s the best metaphor to capture the excitement of our reunification? Perhaps we could think of ourselves as a once famous rock band who amicably splintered to pursue our solo careers. We would certainly be the experimental-minded keyboardist, doing avant-guard work with help of speaker docks and vacuum sealers, whereas the Roomba would be the pop-forward frontman, producing hit after hit, each one more-or-less the same.
And now comes our glorious reunion tour!
(Although, now that I think about it, don’t bands usually reunite when the “well has run dry,” so to speak? As in: a last ditch effort to regain their former wealth or reputation?)
How about a different metaphor: in the 2015 we let the Roomba go off to clean, and now, after many years of service to the greater world, it’s made its circuitous way back to Meh, its noble charging port!
Nice pivot, eh?
Anyway, as we implied above, in the time since we last sold a Roomba, there have been, by our estimation, 6,000 new models released, all of which look almost exactly the same. So, if you’re wondering why you should buy this Roomba instead of a different Roomba, we are too.

But it does have a lot of the other things that make those models great, such as a big bin and an AeroForce High Efficiency Filter, meaning the air that passes through it comes out a lot cleaner (which could be a big deal for allergy sufferers).

When the employees arrived at their first day at the new NOTILUS headquarters, they noticed something strange.
“There is no roof,” one of them said.
“Exactly,” said one of the higher-ups. “It’s an open-roof open-office.”
“But we won’t be protected from the rain,” said another employee.
“Exactly,” the higher-up said again.
The building had tile floors and was equipped with a siren. It sounded whenever a storm approached, at which point, the employees took the tarps provided to them and covered their computers, their phones, anything that could succumb to water damage. Then, they stood. They closed their eyes. They waited for the rain to wash over them so that they could understand it, become one with it.
Thus, when they engineered their shower heads to have 6 settings including “Wide Rainfall” and “Power Rain,” they knew these to be the true to their names. And when they built dual-zone antimicrobial jets that did not clog, it was not only to provide their customers with consistently strong water pressure; it was to mimic the rain that, year after year, never ceased to lessen in its strength.

A lot of the stuff we sell can be categorized as zero-to-sale items. You come here thinking, “I don’t need anything,” and you leave with some headphones or a bunch of junky phone accessories or a veritable pile of blender bottles. Additionally, some of the stuff that ends up here requires some explanation: they’re light bulbs that are also bluetooth speakers? What do you mean, “LED Name-tags”? Hold up, how many audiobooks? That sort of thing.
But this ain’t either of those.
Given that it’s the most expensive product we’ve probably ever sold on Meh, it’s definitely not an impulse buy. Unless you’re, like, a billionaire. In which case, a) what exactly are you doing here? And b) can we get a cool 5 mil to launch our new app? Hear us out: It’s like Shazam, but for smells!
Likewise, the concept of it doesn’t need to be explained. “You know how you have eyes? And when you point them at things, you see the things? And how sometimes, there’s a certain angle from which the things look pretty cool? Well, this ingenious contraption allows you to capture those angles so that you can see the things, even when you’re not near the things.”
Seriously, trying to think of how you’d describe a camera to someone who’s never heard of cameras is actually making me more confused about cameras. So I’ll stop trying and just tell you exactly what we’re dealing with here:
This is a nudge buy.
If you’re someone who’s been thinking about getting a DSLR for a while, biding your time and doing the appropriate level of research required of such a significant purchase, you’re our ideal customer today. Because, we’re basically trying to push you that little bit towards finally saying, “you know what? Screw it. Today’s the day!” And in return, you get this really great DSLR camera and a bunch of lenses and accessories for $100 less than you can get it elsewhere.
And btw, if you’re thinking, nah, I’ll just wait until this price drops, or find somewhere selling it for cheaper, we’ve got some bad news for you. Canon stuff basically never goes down in price. We explain why in detail here. Seriously, go read that. It’s very informative, and one of our best write-ups (which I say with only jealousy, because ugh, I didn’t write it, okay?).
So what do you say, shopper teetering on the fence between Rebel T6i admirer and Rebel T6i owner? With this offer, have we given you a thorough enough poke?

The great philosopher Zaza Pachulia once said: “Nothing easy.” He was referring to the 8th seed Atlanta Hawks forcing a game seven against the 1st seed Boston Celtics, but his words are applicable to so many things in life. For us, there is “nothing easy” about balancing our standards for honest copy with our desire to offer a diverse range of products. Some days, it just seems untenable. And friends, today is one of those days. Because if I gave my 100% honest opinion of this ProCabello Straightener and Styler Kit it would be this:
IDK, it looks good to me, I guess.
See, I don’t actually know. I’ve never used a hair straightener, nor can I foresee a scenario arising in the future where I will either. Then again, this isn’t my first rodeo. There’ve been plenty of products I don’t particularly care about, and when they come up, there’s a simple solution: lean on the Amazon reviews.
Unfortunately this doesn’t help me much here, because the reviews, while positive (and that’s despite the significantly higher price point WITHOUT the “Shine and Hold Spray” we’re including), say very little.
For example, here is Diane Camargo’s review in full:

Love it!! The best flat iron I’ve used

And Karen Tucci writes:

Awesome flat iron. Heats up super fast. Has multiple heat settings. Very happy with my purchase.

And Adrian Blake Hammonds writes:

I love the way my hair feels.

Is it good to see such positive reviews of the item we’re selling? Sure. Do these reviews help me, as a copywriter, find an interesting angle for my write-up? No. Did I include three of them when one would suffice simply to push the write-up further down the page, thus making it appear longer? Of course. Unless it’s @Dave asking, in which case, no way! I did it for integrity!
Really the point is, it’s difficult to write about something without any personal attachment to even the concept of it. That’s why so much copy looks like… well… copy. But that’s not what we want. Likewise, we can’t just sell the stuff we know how to write about. We need to sell items that are outside of our comfort zone sometimes. Are they outside of the greater Meh community’s comfort zone, too? Maybe. Only time (and all of the graphs at the bottom of the page) will tell.
In the meantime, if you know a thing or two about hair straighteners, maybe help us out by leaving a few comments. And if you don’t, but you know someone who does, send this along to them.

We’ve got another weird item pedaling vague impossible-to-prove pseudo-science, so that means another installment of THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE: a feature wherein we lay out the product’s claims and explain why we’re not so sure we believe them. Here goes!
The Claim
The Pure Daily Care Diffuser is the “ultimate starter pack for essential oil enthusiasts.” The various botanical oils are “100% pure” and also “100% organic” with “no fillers or additives.” All of this is fairly simple. Where it gets more interesting is in laying out the benefits of each included oil:

Peppermint is a “mental stimulant” that “provides energy”;
Orange is a “respiratory stimulator, antiseptic, antidepressant, aphrodisiac, and neural stimulator”;
Tea Tree is a “powerful immune stimulator”;
Lemongrass is “neural stimulator” that “soothes aches and pains while also reducing anxiety”;
Lavender is another “neural stimulator” that “reduces stress and anxiety and promotes restful sleep”;
and Eucalyptus is a “respiratory booster” and is “great for relieving sinus congestions.”

The Skepticism
Perhaps I shouldn’t call myself skeptical here. I’m not skeptical. I think this is bullshit, and moreover, I think it’s pretty dangerous. Not the diffuser itself, but the language.
Because eucalyptus oil will not relieve sinus congestion in a meaningful way. And lemongrass oil isn’t going to help with your sore joints. And orange oil is as much an antidepressant as the two day old styrofoam tub that held raw chicken in the trash is a depressant. By which I mean: walking into a house that smells bad sucks, and therefore will make you feel unhappy; so, conversely, walking into a house that smells good doesn’t suck, thus making you happy by contrast.
This is all to say that if you have sinus issues, or joint pain, or depression, don’t just buy a diffuser. See a doctor.
But again, this is an issue of language, specifically language that makes empty promises. The actual truth is essential oil diffusers are great. They don’t smell as fake and chemical-y as plug-ins. They’re not smokey like incense. It’s kinda cool to watch the mist rise out of them. And this one has 7 neat ambient light settings.
That’s why my wife and I are buying one: not for any medical reasons, but because we just moved into a new house and we want it to smell okay. Even when I forget to take out the trash…
In Conclusion
Diffusers are actually pretty nice, as long as what you’re looking for is a good smell, and not a cure."	0.05			2018-08-08T04:00:06.259Z	0.21768616353254416	0.94	62973

It’s been a while since we’ve been able to dip into our library of branded content romance novels, but luckily, we found one that just happens to involve today’s product. Get ready for a tale of desire and medical emergencies in these excerpts from Gene Harmony’s Love Is A Medicine Best Served At The Appropriate Temperature(s).

People were always asking Dale to open jars because of his amazingly strong arms. And people were also always asking why, when he could so easily be a model, he chose to work at the front desk of a pharmaceuticals lab. “Not everyone wants to be on the runway,” he’d say with a smile of clean white teeth that reinforced his model-like qualities. The real answer, though, was that he’d always had the desire to save lives. Working here, where so many important medications were developed, was the closest he could get.
Dale wasn’t the only one in the lab whose good looks were surprising. Rumor had it that Dr. Liza modeled to pay her way through graduate school on the way to becoming the world’s foremost expert on life-saving drugs. Whether that was true or not, Dale had to admit: she was beautiful. Even now, as she rushed up to the desk in her lab coat, clearly flustered, she looked exquisite.
Dale thought maybe she was coming to flirt, something that happened often, though nothing ever came of it. She was a lauded scientist, after all, and he a lowly receptionist. But flirting was not on the agenda today.
“Can I ask a big favor?” she said. “No one else is available to help and there’s a patient in need of an experimental medication. We have to get to the hospital, so it can be safely administered. Could you give me a ride?”
“No problem,” Dale said, standing.
“But there is a problem,” Dr. Liza said. “It’s a complicated medication, comprised of three very volatile liquids that cannot be combined until the last possible minute before being administered. Also, each substance must be kept within a certain temperature range. If I leave them in their test-tubes, they’ll grow too warm or too cold on the ride over.”
“I have just the thing,” Dale said.

Dale and Dr. Liza carried the four Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs out to his car: three filled with temperature controlled substances, one extra, “Just in case,” Dr. Liza had said.
“We need to be careful with these,” she said now, but it was not an issue at all, given that the Primulas’ contemporary attractive twist-textured design allowed for a secure grip. Not to mention they were splash-resistant! “And you’re sure they’re not contaminated?”
“Absolutely,” said Dale. “It’s very easy to clean the mugs themselves. And I put the lids through my dishwasher at home, on the top rack, where it’s safe for them to go.”
Dale could tell that Dr. Liza, though still nervous, was happy to hear this. And she was even happier when she saw that all four mugs fit into the various front- and back-seat cup-holders of Dale’s modest hatchback. “Like a glove,” she murmured to herself. “Maybe I’ll be okay after all.”
“What’s that?” Dale said.
But Dr. Liza didn’t repeat herself.

They’d left the lab an hour ago. The hospital was only five miles away. Yet, they found themselves only halfway there, stuck in unmoving bumper-to-bumper traffic. The reprieve in Dr. Liza’s anxiety, brought on by the various positive aspects of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs, proved temporary. Out of the corner of his eye, Dale had watched her grow more and more upset–first sitting straight up, then tapping her fingers on the dash and sighing loudly.
When she finally spoke, her voice cracked with fear. “It’s no use. We’re getting nowhere. We need to administer the medication now.”
“But how are we going to do that?” Dale said. “The patient is at the hospital.”
“No, I said we need to go to the hospital so they can administer it safely. The patient isn’t there. Not yet. She’s here. Dale, it’s me.”
“What?!”
“Look at me, Dale,” Dr. Liza said. “You’re going to have to administer the drug that’ll save my life from the disease I’ve kept a secret all these months.”
“But, but…”
“There are no buts about it,” Dr. Liza said. She pointed to one of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs. “See that Primula 20oz Insulated Mug? You told me that–with its double walls, vacuum seal, and triple-layer Copper Cold Technology–it can keep liquids hot for up to 8 hours and cool for 24. It makes sense that you’d have such a mug, because you’re a lot like it. You want to save lives. I’ve seen it in your eyes, and like a giant beautiful man-shaped Primula 20oz Insulated Mug, you keep that desire at the appropriate temperature so that it never dies.”
Dale nodded. She was right. He’d waited his whole life for this. Without a word, he got the empty Primula and carefully mixed the contents from the others together in it. “Now, what do I do?”
“It needs to be applied to my lips,” Dr. Liza said. “But first, it requires vermilion stabilization, meaning it must be applied to a healthy pair of lips, and then transferred from those lips to the taker’s.”
Dale understood what he must do. He gravely opened the easy-open, easy-close lid. It was straw-compatible but he didn’t need one now. He let the liquid touch his lips, and then he leaned over the center console to Dr. Liza…

Dale paced. He held a Primula 20oz Insulated Mug. He had cleaned it and filled it with coffee from the hospital waiting room two hours ago when he arrived, and it was still hot.
Finally, the doctor appeared. “She’s recovering,” he said, “thanks to that experimental drug she made and thanks to your administering of it. Still, to be safe, we’ll give her regular doses of it every four hours.”
“And how will you give it to her?” Dale said, feeling strangely jealous. “Do you have a machine for vermilion stabilization?”
The doctor looked at him, confused.
“You know,” Dale said. “It needs to be applied from healthy lips to the lips of the diseased.”
“It’s taken orally, son,” the doctor said. Then a sly grin came across his face. “If I had to wager a guess, I’d say someone has a crush on you!”"	0.05			2018-08-07T04:00:06.333Z	0.5387061168679262	0.92	64187			0.11531935223472428

“Do not cast your pearls before swine.”
People spoke these words without thinking, for a moment, of how they would hurt me, a pig. But more than speak them, they lived by them. Every time I walked into a jewelry store, they quickly rushed to put away their finest pearls.
I told them, “But it is me. I am not a descendent of some clown like Porky. My grandfather built the first ever wolf-proof house. He patented his  special structurally-sound brick-laying technique, and it has been used in the constructions of homes the country over, including three governors’ mansions. He passed his business down to my father who passed it down to me, and now, my net worth is somewhere in the high nine-figures. So please, allow me to purchase the great jewels of the sea.”
Still, I received nothing.
Then, one day, I saw a New Yorker cartoon. One dog sat on the floor, listening to another, seated at a computer. The caption read: “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” For many, it was simply humorous. For me, it was instructive. I realized this was the easiest way to pearl ownership: the internet.
Since then, I’ve made a point to purchase all pearl and mother of pearl jewelry I see for sale online. Truthfully, I don’t even like pearls that much, but I buy them anyway, just to enjoy the warm feeling of a symbolic victory.

You get 2 pairs of Maroo ICE Headphones, but when you receive them, you might think you accidentally ordered 8. Because despite their “smaller fit for women’s ears,” these things come in an unnecessarily big and complicated box. User @Chakolate sums it up pretty nicely:

What is a problem is the amount of packaging. The unopened package is 223 grams, of which 11 grams are the actual headphones. They come in a jewelry-type velvet box, which is nestled in a lot of plastic, which is inside a thin cardboard box, which is wrapped in tissue paper. They also include a carry pouch, and a thick little book about how to use them. (Seriously? They’re kidding, right?) The end package is about 8x3x3"", which is absurd for headphones.

And in case you need some idea of how big that actually is, here’s a picture.

For context, the can next to it is 16 ounces. It’s also a delicious hazy New England style IPA as good as any I had back east from the best brewery in Des Moines! (In case anyone from Confluence is reading and wants to give me some swag.)
Now, you’re probably thinking: “All that stuff for some bedazzled earbuds? What a waste!” But you’re not looking at the big picture. All the various packaging materials are not simply for this product; they’re for a bunch of different things we’ve sold over the course of the last year. For example:


You can cut up the plastic casing and put them in your Ray Ban Eyeglasses when one of the lenses breaks.


You can use the jewelry case to hold your Diamond Encrusted Eternal Heart-Shaped Pearl earrings.


You can use the pouches for safe transport of your WWE TeenyMates.


And you can use the tissue paper when you move to wrap the little espresso cups you got to go along with your Nespresso Vertuo.

Four Blender Bottles probably seems like plenty of Blender Bottles. You have your Blender Bottle, your backup Blender Bottle, a Blender Bottle to try weird stuff in, and a Blender Bottle to give away when your friend is like, “Oh, I should get a Blender Bottle like that.”
Sixteen Blender Bottles is probably too many Blender Bottles. Even if you’re very clumsy with your Blender Bottles, or very experimental, or have a lot of friends who want Blender Bottles, you’re still probably going to end up with a few leftover Blender Bottles.
So why should you get sixteen Blender Bottles?
Because it’s possible that this is the best ever deal on Blender Bottles. You’re probably thinking: sixteen Blender Bottles for $49? That’s about $3 per Blender Bottle. Not bad, right? But it gets even better, because really, if four Blender Bottles costs $20, that means you’re really getting twelve Blender Bottles at $29. So you’re looking at a cost of less than $2.50 per Blender Bottle after the initial four Blender Bottles.
(Which, side note, makes for a great conversation starter. The next time you have some friends over just point to the pile of Blender Bottles in the corner–and there will be a pile of them in the corner; you have sixteen of them, after all–and say, “See that Blender Bottle? That Blender Bottle only cost me $2.42.” Just, make sure you point to one of the last twelve Blender Bottles, not one of the first four Blender Bottles, because as we’ve established, those Blender Bottles cost more.)
With savings like that, can you really pass up buying sixteen Blender Bottles?

The FoodSaver conference room was tense. Nobody knew why the emergency meeting had been called except that it involved “a failure in marketing.”
Finally, Richard, the sixty year old exec who’d sent out the invite, arrived.
“Folks, we’ve got problems,” he said. “Our prized product, the Vacuum Sealing System, is being used for things other than saving food. Which is bad, because that’s our name. One thing they’re using it for is something called ‘Sous vide,’ which I believe is a religion, so we’ll want to be very careful there. But the other thing is–” Richard looked around, and spoke in a hushed tone–“they’re using it for marijuana.”
“They smoke through the machine?” asked Terry, age fifty-two.
“That’s what I thought at first,” Richard said. “But it turns out it’s more for storage and keeping it fresh. Anyway, there’s a whole bunch of people doing it. I found a message board where everyone was snap-chatting about it. The Red Edit.”
“It’s called Reddit,” said the intern, age twenty-one. “It’s the ‘trees’ subreddit.”
“Nope, that’s not it,” said Richard. “It’s definitely not about trees. Your generation wouldn’t understand because your Woodstocks were different. Anyway, we need to cash in on this, and we need to cash in on this NOW. We need a marketing campaign. Something to appeal to the youth.”
“But you just said my generation–”
“Quiet, intern. The adults are talking. Now, let’s spitball a little. What do we got?”
“What if,” said Tony, age fifty-eight, “we do one of those internet pictures and then make it go viral?”
“I like that,” Richard said. “That’s a good plan: a viral internet picture.”
“I’ve seen one particular internet picture,” said Harry, age fifty-eight, “where there’s a man pointing at a butterfly. The man will be labeled, and the butterfly will be labeled, but the man will be saying, ‘Is this a something-other-than-butterfly?’”
“Because it’s labeled as something else,” Richard said.
“No,” said Harry. “I should’ve mentioned that too. He doesn’t call it what it’s labeled, either. He calls it something else. I believe that’s part of the joke.”
“Okay, so,” said Terry, “we label the butterfly ‘FoodSaver’ and the man as ‘consumer’ and he’s asking: ‘Is this a thing for storing my reefer?’”
“Ganja,” said Tony. “Let’s say ‘ganja.’”
“Good catch,” said Richard. “We need to use relevant terms.”
“Also, underneath the question,” said Harry, “it should say, ‘Yes, and you can has it!’”
“That’s with the cat, right?” Richard said.
“No,” Terry said. “Cat says, ‘hang in there.’”
“Well, this has been very productive,” said Richard. “Good work, team. I’ll send this along to the design department. I’ll tell them to redraw the image in case there’s a copyright issue and to get us twelve potential samples by this afternoon.”
“You want the design department to make twelve images in a few hours?” asked the intern.
“Yes,” said Richard.
“But how?”
“They have computers,” Richard said. “It’s easy. And anyway, I don’t tell them how to do their jobs. Until I do. Now, intern, didn’t I put you on a special office sustainability project? I thought you kids love that stuff.”
“You asked me to photocopy a blank piece of paper as a way of saving paper,” said the intern, “but that doesn’t actually make any sense.”
“Look, do you want the college credit or not?”

But already, we’ve messed up. All this talk of “you can get” and “if you want”? Are we crazy? If you’re buying heart pendants online in mid-November, you’re probably not thinking about yourself. You’re buying holiday gifts for others.
But who? Yes, there are plenty of people out there who love jewelry, but these days the gift-giving season (at least in our experience) seems to be less about personal affects and more about technological advancement. You don’t get your mom earrings anymore; you get her a tablet. And you don’t get your grandmother a bracelet; you order her a Roku and help set up Netflix so she can watch her shows on an infinite loop without commercial interruption. So who are you buying this jewelry for?
You might not be able to think of anyone… and that’s exactly the point!
You’re forgetting somebody. Or maybe you’re not. Maybe you didn’t even realize Aunt Gilma was coming this year, after what happened at the Easter Parade. Or maybe you didn’t know Cousin Nick was bringing his girlfriend from college, or that he had a girlfriend at all, or that he was in college, and actually the more you think about it, the less you remember even having a cousin Nick. But that doesn’t matter. She’ll be there for the holidays, and come Christmas morning you don’t want her to have to sit awkwardly on the floor among the landscape of shredded wrapping paper with a big pile of nothing to bring home.
And jewelry is the perfect gift in this situation: a nice, attractive, inoffensive, break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option for that special someone in your life… that you totally spaced on.
In other words, it wouldn’t hurt to just have some around this time of year.
And if you give the pendant to someone who doesn’t like it? Guess what: there’s probably another person coming around for their holiday celebration that they didn’t consider. You know what that is?

Yes, with each day there comes fewer hours of sunlight to warm things up. The numbers you saw on the right in the “low” column have begun their migration left, replacing the previously pleasant “high” temperatures. Thus, this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Maker and travel brewers might, you think, only be used a short time before they go into storage. Because brewing iced coffee in December is like the beverage equivalent of wearing shorts during a blizzard: something done, in states that experience a true winter, only by the extremest of die-hards and season deniers.
As one such person, I can confirm: we are a small, proud, devoted (if not somewhat delusional) group. But we also know a secret that few others seem to understand.
Before I get to that, though, let me clarify. The group I’m talking about is those who drink iced coffee year round. I claim not to know anything about the cold-legged shorts wearers. Although I do wear shorts in the winter months sometimes. For example, if I’m stuck inside and doing something active, like cooking or cleaning.
And this is exactly the secret I’m talking about: winter only happens outside!
Everywhere else, it remains warm enough to drink refreshing smooth cold brew. At home. At work. Even in the car. Actually, especially in the car, after you’ve given it some time to warm up, when it becomes basically a mobile sauna.
What’s funny is that this secret hides in plain sight. Think about it. Do you bake your salads in the winter? Do you pour a bottle of Coca Cola into the kettle and set it to boil? Do you say to the bartender, “I’ll have the IPA, but nuke it on high for 45 seconds”? Sure, a hot toddy, a nice soup, or a steaming mug of hot apple cider is nice. but even in February, these things aren’t as ubiquitous as a glass of cold water and a deli sandwich.
In other words, it’s totally easy to normal to drink cold brew coffee year round. The only tough part is when you walk from the warmth of your car to the warmth of your house or your office with your cold cup in hand.

This MOKCAO POWER+ Cordless Speaker is compatible with the 2nd Generation Amazon Echo Dot, which essentially means this is a vessel for Alexa. She’s called a “digital assistant” but it’s around now, in the fall, where she begins to feel entirely digital and of little assistance.
Alexa can’t rake leaves, and she’s terrible with a leaf blower. Ditto for scraping the frost from your car’s windshield.
You can ask her to help bring the potted plants in from the porch, and she’ll refuse each time, regardless of how polite you are. As if she doesn’t understand SHE works for YOU!
Alexa can tell you the Bolivian city Oruro’s population. She can tell you who serves at its mayor, or what kind of climate it experiences. She can probably tell you its exact coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. But she has no fucking clue where you put your damn sweaters after you moved this past summer.
With certain home systems, it’s likely possible that Alexa could adjust your house’s internal temperature and turn on certain lights at your request. But she is powerless to slow the gusts of wind that keep knocking off the dead branches from the trees in your backyard, or halt the encroaching darkness that aims to devour large swaths of your day.

They say variety is the spice of life, but switching up the spices themselves doesn’t make something entirely new. What’s better: trying an entirely new method of cooking. Take sous vide cooking, for example. Using a slow, rotating hot (but not boiling) water bath to cook your food (which itself is sealed inside a plastic bag) will allow for levels of tenderness heretofore unexperienced.
But as with all things culinary, you should know what you’re getting yourself into. So, instead of spending two-grand on some state-of-the-art sous vide oven that you may or may not enjoy using, try one of these. It will work with any pot and is small enough to be stored easily, while also giving you a taste of what sous vide cooking has to offer.
…is what you can say to whoever you give the second one of of your two Power Precision Sous Vide Cookers to. The real truth is: by giving away one of these to a friend or family member you’re actually giving yourself a gift.
Sous vide cooking is fun. It’s weird. It’s a lot different than most basic cooking methods. And because of that, there are tricks you’re bound to pick up along the way, little ways to improve your food’s flavor, or methods that maybe make it just that much easier.
Still, you’re bound to have some blind spots. Cooking is like having a problem to solve, the problem of how to get all these ingredients into a cohesive “meal.” As such, everyone’s going to come at it from a different angle. And knowing how another person approaches something might help you figure out the best way for you to do things. Thus, by giving your second Power Precision Sous Vide Cooker away to someone you know, you’re basically getting an assistant chef. Or maybe an IRL Youtube tutorial without the terrible five minute intro.
Then again, if you’re giving someone the gift of a sous vide cooker to receive the gift of advice for what you should use your sous vide cooker, you might involuntarily give them the gift of some advice about how they should use their sous vide cooker… which means, you’re only getting one gift while they get two.

Dearest Martha,
I wish I could say that I miss you. Alas, to suffer only a heavy heart would be a great relief! The truth is much worse than that. I write this letter because I am in grave danger, and I fear that I will suffer not death, but something much worse: a living death of sorts.
Yes, “fear”: a word you likely never thought you would see your husband write. For eight months, I cohabited with wild gorillas. For eleven, I roamed with a pack of wolves. For three, I swam with electric eels. I was buried a whole year among the bulldog ants of Australia in an attempt to understand their tunnel structure. Never once, in any of those cases, did I feel even remotely afraid. But none of them compare to this.
Though it may void my contract with the research firm, I will give you the full details of my current assignment: I was sent to integrate myself into a community of EarPod wearers, so that I might discern once and for all what makes them such incredible assholes.
I have, for the last month, been living among them somewhere in the Bay Area in what I believe is an apartment, but also seems to be a concert venue and startup. The startup is focused on an app of some kind but no one here actually programs. They all work as “organic social marketing disruptors” though many also dabble, I’m told, in graphic design. They wear their EarPods always. And so do I.
This is what I mean by a living death, Martha. Since putting the EarPods in, I have begun to have thoughts that seem not to belong to me. At first it was just, PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT on a constant loop. But as I acclimated, I began to think things like It’s too bad the world isn’t as present as me, or My podcast is better than this one, or What idiot called these EarPods instead of Lil’ Listenies? The other day, I thought once again about them falling out, but this time, it was, If these EarPods fall out, what’s going to keep my head from floating away?
Martha, I am losing it. Or: I am losing myself. So please, come quickly. Unfortunately, I am not sure my exact address, so you will have to fly to San Francisco and look for posters for a show we are hosting, featuring a performance by an artist named Transl8. He does electro-folk, as well as politically-conscious trip-hop.
Also, please bring a pair of Rowkin Bluetooth Earbuds. Just as I needed to take measures in order to avoid the bends when I resurfaced after spending those weeks with the angler fish, so must I do the same now. And those Rowkins are stylish, wireless, and way less obnoxious than EarPods. They should return me to myself in no time.
Make haste.

Think of your favorite Christmas mornings growing up: you woke up after barely sleeping, rushed to the tree, and tore open your presents. Then maybe came some reprieve–maybe you ate some pancakes and drank some hot cocoa–after which the real fun started: you spent the next several hours painstakingly assembling a tiny model from even tinier pieces so that it could sit atop your desk forevermore!
Okay, maybe that wasn’t exactly how it went. Probably, you played video games, or with some new action figures or dolls. Maybe you watched some movies on TV, maybe you ate more pancakes, drank some more cocoa, maybe you didn’t get out of your pajamas until four in the afternoon when it was time for Christmas dinner, and maybe you were ready for bed at seven, the calories and the sporadic sleep from the night before combining into a potent sleep aid.
And I wouldn’t blame you if that’s what you chose to do. Because those things are more enjoyable than building a model. But here’s something to think about: are they as satisfying?
Because there’s an important difference here. Yes, you might enjoy a candy bar more than taking a jog. Yes, you might enjoy bingeing ten seasons of some guilty-pleasure thriller on Netflix more than spending the afternoon preparing a five-course meal for your visiting relatives. And yes, you’re probably going to enjoy sitting around on the couch on Christmas overindulging in food, toys, and TV (or for adults: food, booze, and basketball) more than building the tiny model of the Eiffel Tower that you got in your stocking.
But you won’t be as satisfied.
Anyone who’s ever done anything requiring a modicum of will-power and ingenuity–even if only to solve a minor problem of their own making–knows that the accompanying frustration quickly gives way to a more lasting pride. Every deep breath you take all day will remind you of that jog. For weeks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment after making that meal. And while you might regret all of the pancakes and cocoa and movies and Christmas cookies well before December 26th, you will always be able to look at your model and think, with a smug sense of satisfaction, I did that.

Here’s how it works: we give you the claim the product makes, explain why we’re more than a little dubious, and then in the end, we come to some conclusion (if ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ can be considered a conclusion). Let’s get started!
The Claim
CBD is “a natural constituent of hemp” that “has been shown to have positive health benefits.” But since it contains no THC, it won’t get you high. Thus, it supposedly can help treat stuff like pain and anxiety with less risk of endless philosophizing or nachos.
The Skepticism
Here are pretty much all of the things we can definitively say about CBD:

It is short for cannabidiol.

Did we get all that? Does anyone need anything repeated? In the back? Can you all hear me?
Okay, that’s a simplification. There’s more. For example, we also know that, like Hansel, this CBD shit is just so hot right now. According to a New York Times article by Alex Williams, Willie Nelson is launching a line of CBD-infused coffee beans (two of his favorite things in one cup, he says), Mandy Moore is toying with it to see if it helps relieve the pain of walking in heels, and Glamour magazine ran a story with the headline “I Replaced My Entire Beauty Routine With Only CBD Products.” I am linking it here as proof. I refuse to actually read it, which I consider an act of self-care.
But what does it actually… do? Gabe Kennedy a twentysomething CBD start-up founder offers this:

Comparing it to the feeling after an intense meditation or yoga session, Mr. Kennedy added that the CBD glow has “synergistic downstream effects” in terms of social connections. “Around others, I find myself more present and attentive, more creative and open.”

To put my reaction in terms that Mr. Kennedy’s ilk would understand, I’d say the ROI on reading that paragraph was that I experienced an exciting disruption in the mouth sector, which, had I not cupped my hand over my lips, might just have gone viral all over my keyboard.
But while it’s fun to mock the eye-roll parade that the article provides, it also validates the claim made by Christie Aschwanden over at FiveThirtyEight: “the marketing has gotten way ahead of the science.”
Aschwanden is definitely more focused on the what than the why. Her article’s thesis is pretty well summed up by its headline: “Does CBD Really Do Anything?” There are definitely some serious WTF moments in here too. For example, when CBD-pedaling doctor Joe Cohen makes the claim that it has anti-cancer properties and might even help with Alzheimers, Aschwanden raises concern that these effects weren’t discussed in two of the most significant cannabis-focused reports out there. The good doctor’s reply: “I think you just have to Google search it.”
Moreover, though, she raises some important points, most notably that we don’t have mixed messages when it comes to CBD; we have almost no messages at all, because very few tests have looked at it on its own:

Animal models and a few human studies suggest that CBD can help with anxiety, but those are the only conditions with much research on CBD in isolation.

Otherwise, most studies focus on cannabinoids more generally, where they have actually found “‘conclusive or substantial evidence’ supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain in adults, multiple sclerosis-related spasticity (a kind of stiffness and muscle spasms), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”
Though, this assumes you’re getting a real dose, which also seems to be up in the air:

There are no guarantees that the label accurately reflects what’s in the product. For a 2015 study published in JAMA, researchers tested 75 products [cannabis] purchased in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle and found that only 17 percent were accurately labeled. More than half of the products contained significantly lower levels of cannabinoids than the label promised, and some of them contained only negligible amounts of the compounds.

The Conclusion
When we promise something here, we hold ourselves to it, so here comes: after reading about CBD, we can say, conclusively, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . But actually, it seems not to be super risky and to have some potentially great outcomes. So if you’re feeling anxious or a little achy, give it a try. Like most of this stuff, if you don’t think of it as a cure-all, you should be fine."	0.06			2018-11-02T04:00:05.893Z	0.42612956253890216	0.93	66292

It’s easy to come up with jokes about these things, and not just because they’re called “Lovesac Sactionals.” Like, imagine replacing all of a friend’s furniture with these one night, so they awake and believe they’ve grown. Or imagine a business man who uses them in his office as a power move, so that whenever someone comes to meet with him, they have to sit crouched to the ground feeling small.
But really, this hilarious world I’m describing, where everything is out of proportion is actually what young kids experience all the time, just inverted.
As @Superllama7 helpfully points out, “kids and pets can also use adult-sized furniture.” This is true, of course. Yet adult-sized furniture doesn’t really give kids a sense of ownership. Kids have toys and books. They have a bedroom they might share, and a bed to sleep in. But rarely are they given their own little space for quiet comfort in daytime, which is too bad, because it’s something they might like.
@2palms’s daughter did, at least: “with the double-wide seat she can get a leg up, then camp out in the corner with her books.” If that sounds super cute, I’ve got news for you: it is. @2palms includes two adorable pictures of “quiet morning reading time” on one of the 2 “chaise lounges” they put together. (@2palms elsewhere describes the Sactional furniture’s sturdiness, in case that’s a concern).
We should add that this time around, we’re selling them a bit differently than we did in September. Instead of doing it piece-by-piece, we’re offering a few different packages. You can get:
2 Seats, 4 Sides: Great for the kid who will occasionally keep the company of a couple action figures, perhaps a teddybear, but also enjoys a quiet night in with a good (pop-up) book.

That’s ridiculous, Lucy. It’s 2018; you need furniture for casual get-togethers.
8 seats, 10 sides: Basically everything you need to build a simple playpen, except one that’s softer and won’t raise the ire of your interior decorator friends.

Ladies and gentleman, friends and enemies, lovers and fighters, today we offer you something incredible: control of our most essential invisible resource, the very air we breath.
Birds? They are mere riders of the sky, nothing more than hangers-on. Airplanes? For all of their ingenuity, their undeniable feats of engineering, they still must heed the air’s wishes. When the air says, I shall have a massive storm here, in your flight path, does the plane puff out its chest and cry, Not today, air! Your storm can wait? No! The plane says, Ah, yes sir, yes sir, whatever you prefer, air! We shall find a new way to where we are going! And if the air says, The storm will be massive; there is nowhere to go, the plane replies with a nervous laugh, and says, Of course, sir! Totally understandable, sir! Take your time, sir! We will be right down here on the ground if you need us, sir!
In other words, birds are nihilists and planes are weak-willed.
You are neither.
The air might find its way through some unseen passageway into your house in the dead of night, at the height of winter. And it may say to you, Behold my dryness! It may say, Watch, as your knuckles fissure and grow red! Watch as your skin flakes! Watch as your lips chap, even in here, where you thought you were safe from my wrath! It will cackle with bitter delight as it watches you apply lotion and balm, knowing they are like cheap bandaids in the shadow of its vengeance.
Then the air will feel something itself, a chill. But more than that: it will feel the slow in-creep of moisture. It will say, Is there some glitch in your heating and cooling system? And you will point to your Pure Enrichment Cool Mist Humidifier, and you will say, “No, there is no glitch at all.” Then you will say, “Now dance, air!” And it will cry tears of humidity, but it will dance!

I, Clive Grunley, am not a mere athlete. Nor a biathlete. Nor a triathlete or anything so simple. No sir, I am a sexdecathlete, if you know what I mean!
What I mean is I compete in competitions comprising of sixteen distinct athletic feats. Why do you look so surprised? Did you think a sexdecathlete was something else?
A traditional sexdecathlon begins with a twenty mile run (1). Next, is a swim of at least 4 miles (2), but additional miles can be swum to earn tokens which can be used to hire additional bridge builders to help you build the bridge (3) back over the body of water you just swam across.
After that comes the javelin toss (4), followed by a short sprint (5), in order so that you can catch the same javelin you just tossed (6), and then, while holding it aloft, discuss with several gifted undergraduates how the javelin can serve, in literature, as a metaphor for one’s ascension and subsequent decline (7).
This is followed by a water break, which is not a break as in a moment of reprieve, but another event wherein each competitor builds a mold, pours water into it, freezes it, and then breaks the sculpture upon the shoulder of a competitor before they have one broken over theirs (8). Those who lose are disqualified, and given a strong handshake by those continuing on (9).
Next, you chop down a tree (10), then climb at least halfway up the tree (11), and carve some part of the three into a surfboard (12) while it is falling, so that you have something to ride when your tree eventually lands in the wave pool. You then ride a wave (13) to the artificial “shore” wherein a meeting ensues among remaining competitors as to how you might maintain the tree-related events while also promoting sustainability (14).
Which leaves nothing to do but cross the finish line (15) and exchange high fives (16). Yes, these count as events, as the finish line is a moat filled with poisonous snakes and we call them high fives because they must be completed atop a nearby mountain of you and your high-fiving partner’s choosing.
Anyway, the point being: after a long sexdecathlon, I’m beat. And I need at least three Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Packs to sooth my aches. I especially like that the texture provided by the ceramic beads allows for a nice massage. And let me tell you, us sexdecathletes might all be different, but every one of us likes a good rub!

If you’re shopping for yourself, you can get any food processor you want. You can take your parents’ old food processor. You can go to the thrift store, find one, search around for an outlet to make sure it spins, and take that one home. Or maybe you don’t need to go through all that trouble; maybe you just buy it as soon as you see it. If it doesn’t work, oh well! It was only a few bucks.
But if you’re getting someone a food processor as a gift, you need to do a little bit better than that. You don’t want to give your husband or wife or newly married friend something used that you’re pretty sure works. You need to give them something clean, something shiny, something new.
More than that: you need to give them a brand they’ve heard of.

Four truths and three lies about the artist Adam Koford:


Adam Koford, as a shirt designer often under the moniker of “Apelad”, has sold more than 260 designs on websites like Shirt.Woot, including several that this former Woot copywriter often still thinks of and laughs aloud.


Adam Koford’s art studio is in a house boat currently floating in international waters, the only place he can execute his diabolical pencil hold without being taken into police custody.


Adam Koford was, for a time, a jockey. He and his horse Maple Syrup were dominant, winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. On the track of the Belmont Stakes, though, disaster struck. Just feet from the finish line, Maple Syrup collapsed in a cloud of gray smoke, at which point it was discovered Maple Syrup was not a horse at all, but a robot powered, at its center, by a tiny car driving on a tiny treadmill.


Adam Koford is the creator of Laugh-Out-Loud Cats, a webcomic which can be viewed at HOBOTOPIA.com, as well as in a new book, One More For The Road, COMING SOON (stay tuned to Hobotopia for an official announcement in a couple weeks). A few months ago, he posted his 3000th Laugh-Out-Loud cats drawing. And since pictures are each worth a thousand words, that means Koford has produced the equivalent of 3 million words, the equivalent of somewhere between 30 and 50 novels. That’s impressive!


Adam Koford opens bananas by making several exacting surgical incisions with a scalpel. The peel-removal process can take up to two hours, but according to Koford, it’s worth it. “If you respect the fruit,” he says, “it will in turn respect you by unlocking heretofore hidden flavors.”


Adam Koford has worked as a senior writer and story artist on the video game versions of Bolt, Toy Story 3, and Cars 2. Which means he can say things like, “I wrote Toy Story 3,” and not technically be lying!

Many considered A Portal Among The Pages, published in 1978, to be the book that marked science fiction author Hal Pembry’s ascension from merely great into the canon. His previous seven novels to that point had been entertaining and thought-provoking, but few managed to evoke the magic that Portal  seemed to achieve so easily. As one reviewer wrote, “When Finley [the book’s protagonist] first finds the Encyclopedia of Time, he does not know that it functions essentially as a time machine, yet he senses something special between the covers. Readers might find this sensation quite relatable, as they sit in their favorite chair, holding Pembry’s masterwork aloft.”
His fans were eager to see what he would come up with next. And they were profoundly disappointed when the answer turned out to be: nothing. Pembry never wrote another book. In fact, he disappeared altogether. Many assumed he’d gone the way of other successful literary eccentrics–that the fame had been too much for him and so he’d retired somewhere quiet for a life of seclusion. Others posited that the terrible film adaptation had driven him to flee out of embarrassment. A small faction of particularly conspiracy-minded fans put forward a theory of murder at the hands of Kyle Tolliver, a rival author driven mad by jealousy because his own stellar novel’s release had been eclipsed by Portal (this being a pun many newspapers made while discussing the books’ relative sales, as Tolliver’s concerned a deadly solar eclipse).
None of these theories came close to the truth. In actuality, Pembry’s novel was a confession of what was to come: he’d discovered a way in which he could, through literature, bend time. I know because he told me when I spotted him last week outside of a used bookstore in Omaha. He did not look a day older than his author photo from forty years ago.
I asked what he thought of life in our current age and he said, “It’s okay. There are many things that science fiction foresaw, only different in minor ways. There are robots that work for you, but the one’s that move have no personality, and the ones with personality don’t move. They live in speakers and phones. And then there’s that.”
He pointed to the GOTRAX Hoverfly ECO Hover Board I had ridden up on.
“I’ve read all about those. About how their electrical safety is certified, about how they can go nearly 8 miles per hour and up to 12 miles distance before needing a charge. It’s truly a work of ingenuity. Only, when I and many of my contemporaries had imagined hover-vehicles, I thought they would truly hover. Again, it’s not that I’m unimpressed. Sometimes, I wish there was just a bit more whimsy. At any rate, I ought to be going.”
I asked him where and he corrected me. “It’s when,” he said, then told me to name a year. 1919 was what came to mind, and he took out a small unmarked book from his blazer pocket, opened it to a specific page somewhere in the middle. “Ah,” he said. “Interesting.” He pointed to a line written on the page. I tried to lean over and see but in that moment, there came a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew, Pembry was gone."	0.05			2018-10-26T04:00:03.801Z	0.24495605686952773	0.93	63926

We all have our preferences when it comes to luggage. Some of us prefer the hard-sided rolling bag. We like that what we see is what we get, that its shape remains steadfast always. We find comfort in knowing that our things will be safe inside. Perhaps we go on a vacation and buy a commemorative glass; with our hard-sided luggage we can be sure that it will be safe, as long as you don’t pack it too loosely. You don’t have to worry about some other bag in the cargo crushing it.
Others of us prefer the duffel. It’s casual but also classic. It can go down the street to the gym, or across the world to Shanghai. If you don’t have much to pack, it’ll take up less space. You can pack lightly or overpack a little bit. Its soft sides are forgiving. Also: they’re malleable. Pack one full of clothes, and you can squeeze it almost anywhere. It’s like a firmer pillow.
And yet…
There are times when we wish our hard-sided luggage had just a little bit more give to fit in the tight space behind the passenger seat of a fully packed car. And there are times when we’d like trust our duffel to hold its shape just a little bit more. For example, when we travel to wine country in Oregon, we want to bring back a bottle of wine, not a bag full of wet wine-scented clothing and some decorative shards of glass.
In other words: when it comes to bag-style our preference is not as firm as we might think. And facing this knowledge, it quickly becomes clear that the options aren’t hard-sided or duffel. They’re:

We can refuse to choose. We can eschew bags altogether. We can wear all of the clothes we want to bring on a given trip, layered over each other. The top layer can be pair of cargo pants and a hoodie with a big pouch. In the pockets: our toiletries, our travel knickknacks, our phones, etc.

Or…

We can choose both. As in, we can buy one of each: a U.S. Polo hard-sided bag, and a U.S. Polo rolling duffel. If we’re going for ten days at the vase expo, we can bring the hard-sided luggage. If we’re driving across the country and want something that’s easy to roll in and out of motels every night, we can take the duffel. But with both, we always have what you need.

Okay, fine. This is manipulative. If you really want to buy just one or the other, that’s fine too… But know this: some day, you might regret that choice–some day, you might need those hard sides or that soft top–and when that day comes, we won’t be able to help you. Because we’re a deal-a-day site. And we might not be selling luggage that day."	0.05			2018-10-25T04:00:09.038Z	0.19988858668938622	0.94	64860

What you get with other razors is pretty simple: a brand name and a shave. With these razors, we’re obligated to keep the company that makes them a secret. You might think that means you only get the shave, no name. But you actually get so much more! Such as:
A Smug Sense Of Superiority
These other people–nay, these other sheep–wander around, blindly trusting the messages pedaled by our corporate overlords, but not you. No, you’re enlightened. If you could sharpen kale stalks into rustic straight-blade razors, you would. But you can’t. You’ve tried. So you’re left with one other option: unnamed razors purchased on a cheap deal-a-day site. Are they corporately-made razors? Sure. But at least you get to say: “I may not be able to avoid you, but that doesn’t mean I have to like you!”
Potential Podcast Fame
Maybe buying a Gillette razor will give you some peace of mind. But you don’t build a podcast empire on peace of mind. You build it on unanswered questions. You build it information that seems forever on the periphery, always close, but never clear. What we’re saying is, if you buy these razors, it just lead you to launch a wildly popular serialized investigative podcast in order to search out the truth: who made the razors? Can Gillette give you that?
A Possible Connection To A Possibly Award Winning Movie
Will we say definitively that the razors we’re selling here are the same brand and style that Mr. Robot himself Rami Malek used to shave his other-worldly jawline, leaving only the iconic Freddie Mercury mustache for his performance in what just might be the film of the year, Bohemian Rhapsody? No. We won’t say that. But we also won’t definitively say that it’s NOT the same type of razor he used either. Eh?

There’s a double-standard here. If you buy a shirt that’s slimming and shave every day because your facial hair comes in patchy or comb your hair a certain way that looks best with your face-shape, it wouldn’t be considered inauthentic. If anything, it’s the opposite. It shows an intelligence, an understanding of what you have and what works best. Because none of those things are harmful or uncomfortable or particularly time-consuming. They’re just simple steps you take to look your best.
On the other hand, if you try to slow the thinning of your hair–or at least slow the appearance of your hair thinning–that’s considered inauthentic. It’s mocked. Men are told that going bald is embarrassing, but also that covering up baldness is embarrassing. Because it exhibits some denial of reality, a fight against what nature has intended for you.
To which, we reply: Yeah, no shit! And there’s nothing wrong with that!
Maybe at some point, we can all wear ponchos, choosing between three or four each morning based solely on thickness of material. Those who are not going bald will stop cutting their hair, and those who are going bald will allow their hair to recede without ridicule. We will all stop showering, and we will all stop brushing our teeth, and we will cease complaining about the natural odors of our bodies and breath. And if some lose their teeth because theirs are weak, they will drink only nutritional juice of a greenish-brown color, and no one will judge them for it.
Until then, we just gotta do what we gotta do to look whatever way feels best. And if that’s using a hair fiber and locking spray, so be it.
(And P.S., yes: given that we have out spoken against pseudo-science in the past, we did give a healthy amount of side-eye to the marketing copy that claims, “negatively charged Moroccan cotton fibers adhere to positively charged individual strands of natural human hair at the root for a noticeably fuller look.” But here’s the thing: there’s a difference in how harmful it is to say some fibers make your head look nice versus claiming an aligned chakra is the best arthritis medicine, so we’ll let it slide.)"	0.05			2018-10-23T04:00:01.475Z	0.3256555514094781	0.94	62467			0.10346348247905289

When the exorcist arrived, the toy seller was pacing the sidewalk in front of his shop.
“You called,” the exorcist said, “for some assistance?”
“Oh, it’s you,” the toy seller cried. “I was worried you might not arrive in time. Yes, yes. I am in desperate need of your help! Some of my toys, you see: they’ve been possessed!”
“Let me guess,” the exorcist said. “Tiny toy soldiers are mounting a microscopic war against you.”
“No,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s little knights, I’m sure,” the exorcist said. “They ride in upon plastic horses and jab you with their surprisingly sharp lances.”
“It’s not them either,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s certainly dolls and stuffed toys,” the exorcist proclaimed. “Raggedy Annes and Andys, sock monkeys, and teddy bears, all singing ironic songs of friendship while stalking your every move, each brandishing pencils sharpened into shivs.”
“Actually,” the toy seller said, “it’s fidget spinners.”
“Wait, what? Fidget spinners? Seriously?”
“I’m afraid it’s very serious,” the toy seller said. “They just won’t stop… spinning.”
“That’s it,” the exorcist said. “They’re just spinning? Like fidget spinners do? But on their own?”
“Exactly! And I have work to do! But I can’t anything done! Because I’m so distracted by their infernal noises! Some of them even glow!”
The exorcist nodded. “I understand. They glow brightly with the spirits of the dead.”
“Nope,” the toy seller said. “They’re just the LED kind. And they don’t all glow very brightly. They’re pretty hit-or-miss, to be honest. A lot of them are fine, but the lights on some are dim, or out entirely. That’s why we’re selling them for cheaper than the non-LED ones.”
“Okay,” the exorcist said. “I think I know what to do. But I’ll need absolute privacy while I carry out the… um… exorcism. And I’m sorry to say, I’ll need to take the fidget spinners with me. To… ensure they don’t get possessed again or whatever.”
The toy seller did not object. In fact, he hugged him and thanked him with tears and his eyes. The exorcist assured him it would all be okay. Then, leaving the man to pace again on the sidewalk, he stepped into the store. It was true: the fidget spinners were possessed. They spun and spun and spun, until the exorcist said a quick three-word incantation, returning them finally to stillness.

Welcome to everyone’s favorite day: Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, wherein we offer a new shirt or whatever every Sunday until, eventually, we get lazy or forget and it ends! Today’s shirt requires a little more explanation than the others. Basically, it’s the Casemates launch shirt, on royal blue… BUT you get a choice: the original sketchy version of the logo (and that’s sketchy as in sketch-like; not like, “it can’t be trusted”) or a new exciting more geometric-looking logo!
That leaves you with four potential purchase choices:
You Purchase The Classic Design
This the option for people who respect tradition. You want a shirt you can wear each night when you return to your victorian home and settle into your bergère chair to re-read Don Quixote. What’s that playing in the background? Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16, of course. And what’s that you’re drinking? Maybe a glass of 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir, or maybe a Boulevardier cocktail that you’ve been antiquing for a few days in a mason jar in the fridge. It all goes just smashingly with your new (or should we say old?) Casemates shirt!
You Purchase The New Design
Here, we have the modern choice. You’ll look right at home wearing this when you pull your electric car into the driveway of your house, a recent construction comprised, it appears, of only the most jagged of edges. Inside, you’ll ask your digital assistant to play the latest release from your favorite musician, a masked individual from a country far away who makes electronic music that is one step removed from the dial-up modem noise. Then you’ll settle in to read a collection of experimental prose poetry while sitting on a piece of brutalist furniture that might be a couch but also might be an end table; you can’t remember. What you are sure of: how comfortable you feel in your exciting new Casemates shirt!
You Purchase Both
This one goes out to all those who toe the line between classic and modern. You like mid-century modern furniture. You listen to blue-grass covers of new wave songs and new wave covers of blue-grass songs. In short, you appreciate all things: from the old and traditional to the new and innovative. If we may be so bold: this is definitely the best choice.
You Purchase Neither
This choice, on the other hand… well, it’s not really a choice at all. It’s the absence of one. You’ve essentially chosen not to choose. To put it bluntly, you are empty. You see stories about rescue dogs on Facebook and feel nothing. you stand directly in front of the elevator doors waiting for them to open, not because you’re in a rush, not because you think you’re better than other people, but because you haven’t thought at all. Often, you feel as though you’ve forgotten something. Your phone? No. It’s in your pocket. Your wallet? No. That’s there too. Your keys? No again. Really, you have forgotten nothing; instead, what you’re experiencing is the sensation of your being crying out to fill the hole where a soul should be.
Anyway, hope this helps you make your decision! Happy Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, and until next time (if there is a next time)…"	0.07			2018-10-21T04:00:03.298Z	0.49400280593593765	0.94	54240

This is a drone. It does what drones do. It flies around for nine minutes, hovers in the air, etc. @Moose tested it. He said it actually was one of the easiest to fly, and might be the most stable of the ones he’s tried for our site. They could’ve marketed it for that: its ease and stability.
Or maybe they could’ve called it a photo drone or a video drone, because it does have a camera that can take 1.3MP pictures and 720p videos. After all, drones are often used for photos or videos. My pretty basic wedding package featured a video done with a drone. Remember that shot at the end of 10 Things I Hate About You, of the band playing on the top of building while the credits rolled? That shot probably required licensed pilots, a helicopter, crew members, waivers, the works. Now, anyone could make something that looks like that, for, I’d estimate, 5 figures less thanks to drones. Like this one.
And no: a Remake-The-Last-Shot-Of-10-Things-I-Hate-About-You-Or-Something-Like-It Drone isn’t exactly going to move units here in 2018… but it would probably be better than Selfie Drone.
Like, are you fucking serious? The phrase “selfie drone” is verbal ipecac. It takes ingenuity and renders it into an overcomplicated way for millennials to engage in the act that has become synonymous with the self-absorption most other generations (wrongly) know them for.
Still, what annoys me isn’t the how clear it is that this product was definitely named by some old dude thinking he’d discovered a new way to “reach the youth.” It had to be, by the way, because, say what you will about millennials, they at least know what a selfie is, and a photo that you need a drone’s angle to capture is not a selfie; it’s a photo with you in it. There’s a difference.
What annoys me is how reductive it is. It’s a dumb marketing 101. It thinks it’s carved out some entirely new lane in the drone game by catering to the selfie-obsessed among us, without taking into account the large number of people that it would turn off. Like, there are probably folks who arrived at the site today, read the product name, and said, “oh, no way,” and navigated away without reading another word. Or even if they did get further, they might still be thinking, It could be cool… but cool enough to risk my friends seeing a box that says “Selfie Drone” on it in the week before the recycling gets picked up? I don’t know…
That’s what really annoys me. But it doesn’t annoy me that much, to be honest. I mean, there’s a reason we can sell this thing here for $20. And it’s not because it’s a bad drone."	0.07			2018-10-20T04:00:46.966Z	0.34139579152096994	0.94	51885

Dear iRobot,
You’ve done what many companies aspire to do, but few actually achieve. In this stratosphere of success, your company is elite: Xerox, Kleenex, Ping Pong. Your product’s name–the Roomba–is now synonymous with (or maybe even supersedes) the “robot vacuum cleaner.” Congratulations.
And many of us here at Meh have been along for the ride since nearly day one. Yet, there’s something that’s frustrated us over the years: every time we sell a Roomba, we realize the model is slightly different than the previous one, despite looking almost exactly the same. We then dive into hours of research, hoping to solve the mystery of what’s so different in order to help our customers make an informed purchasing decision–only to find, in the end,  something trivial, like the canister capacity being one tenth of a percent larger than before.
What we’re saying here, iRobot, is: help us. Or, help us help you. Why not give every  new Roomba a feature that really STANDS OUT, so that they can be easily differentiated?
For example:


You could make one that says “sorry” whenever it bumps into a wall. An another that cries out in pain whenever it bumps into a wall. And another that recites a poem by Robert Frost in a Mike Tyson accent whenever it bumps into a wall.


Or a model that kisses your ankles when it goes by so that you know it loves you.


How about a Roomba that can take all the crumbs from the kitchen floor and forms them into new snacks for you to serve at your next party?


Maybe one Roomba could feature “pie warmth and texture.” And then the ""Plus ""version of that model could also feature “pie flavor.” And it could just be a pie.


Or what about a Roomba that just came with one completely functional human finger? Is that too much to ask?


Look, iRobot: the sensors, the 3-Stage Cleaning System, the ability to automatically adjust to any floor and navigate around furniture–that stuff is cool and all, but it’s also what we expect. Why not give people something a bit more unique? It would certainly be great for us. And if it’s great for us, isn’t it great for you too?
Just something to think about.
Sincerely,

“Another lame Halloween,” Arthur said. “It’s like, what’s wrong with giving out candy? Everyone around here tries to get too creative. I got the worst stuff.”
“You got the worst? Wait until you see what I’ve got,” Lisa said.

Lisa leaned over and looked. “Are those malt balls floating in it?”

“How is it?”
“It’s okay. There are some point of telling issues. Like, if you’re going to use a retrospective POV, the narrator can’t be surprised by the events as they unfold. Also, some of the fantastical elements frustrate me. I keep thinking: what are the rules of this world?”
“Huh,” Arthur said. “I wouldn’t be much help. I’m a journalist, not a novelist. Or at least I am now that a woman on Church Street gave me this.” He handed a diploma over to Lisa.
“Wow, a journalism degree! From George Washington University! They could be really useful,” Lisa said, “for mopping up the soup!”

Probably, we should lie. We should say that this is practical. We should say something like: you can garden from inside! We should claim something about how, with the success of HBO’s Sharp Objects, wealthy families have a renewed interest in dollhouses, and some of them are even hiring full construction crews to break ground and build them; get the heavy duty equipment your crew needs to beat out the other bidders!
But we won’t. Instead, we’ll look both ways, we’ll lean forward, we’ll gesture for your to lean forward too, and then we’ll whisper into your ear…

Two-for-Tuesday? Where’s the ambition in that? Yes, it sounds nice. But we can’t let alliteration lower our standards. So today, it’s four-for-Tuesday or twenty-four-for-Tuesday (which, I guess is technically alliterative).
That’s right, a choice between four or twenty-four. You know that means, it’s…
ORDER/HOARDER!!!
In these semi-regular sales, we provide two options: one a fair number of things for a good price; the other is an unfair number of things for a GREAT price. So, without further ado, let’s get started.
Today’s product is…
FLEECE BLANKETS!
I don’t know about where you all live, but here, the weather has taken a dark turn. It even snowed yesterday! Which means: it’s time to make a nice cup of tea or cocoa and bundle up under a fleece blanket on the couch with one to twelve dogs and/or cats for the next five months.
THE MATH
The four-pack will run you $14. That’s $3.50 per blanket. Not bad, right? But wait! The twenty-four pack goes for $60. That’s $2.50 per blanket. But wait even more! If the first four cost $14, that means the last twenty cost just $46, which is $2.30 per blanket! Does it make sense to break it down like that? Probably not! But that’s how we do it here on Order/Hoarder days!
WHAT TO DO WITH FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
With four fleece blankets, you can put one on the couch, one on recliner, keep one in the office, and still have a backup to rotate in when one is being washed. Or, store them all in a closet and break them out for a late fall bonfire.
WHAT TO DO WITH TWENTY-FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
So! Much! For example:


You could give them out as gifts to twenty-four of your favorite people!


Or, if you don’t have twenty-four favorite people, give them as gifts to twelve of your favorite people! (You can use the remaining twelve fleece blankets as wrapping paper for the other twelve fleece blankets!)


Send one to each venue on your favorite band’s 24-stop winter tour to show you’re a true fan!


Or, give one to all but four members of the twenty-eight piece Swedish indie pop group, I’m From Barcelona, in case they have to play any cold weather outdoor festivals! If they complain about not everyone getting a blanket, just tell them you’re not the idiot who decided to start a twenty-eight person band!


Use them to build a winter-ready tent in the bank yard! Actually, hell, you’ve got 24 fleece blankets! Build a winter-ready tent mansion!


Interior decorators will tell you that the right lighting can give rooms a soft, warm feeling; we say, why stop at lights? Why not take that “soft, warm feeling” over the top by wallpapering your house with fleece blankets?


See? Maybe twenty-four fleece blankets isn’t so impractical after all.
So, what’s it going to be: are you going to place a boring old order, or are you going to take the exciting first steps to becoming a fleece blanket hoarder?"	0.05			2018-10-16T04:00:03.596Z	0.3410857897640822	0.93	63281

Let’s start off general and work our way into more specifics. Every laptop manufacturer calls their product something different, but a Chromebook isn’t just a cool name. It’s actually a different kind of computer. Laptop Magazine sums it up nicely:

Instead of Windows 10 or macOS, Chromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. These machines are designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with most applications and documents living in the cloud.

In other words, if you live in a cabin somewhere in the mountains, and you have to hike and ski many miles back to civilization to grab a solitary bar of wi-fi, this might not be your best bet. Nor would it be a good option if you’re looking for a machine that can support your career cutting movie trailers and playing the latest computer games. These things are pretty sparse, in terms of power.
But for the rest of us, who pretty much never stray far from the router and who mostly use our computers for checking email, keeping track of things, writing, and organizing: a Chromebook is actually a pretty great, pretty cheap option.
And this one is actually both of those things: we’re selling it for just under $150, and on Amazon it has four stars on over 1,000 reviews.
Yes, if you want to be cynical, you could say: but wait, Meh, this thing came back out who-knows-when, and many of those reviews were written a while ago. And that’s true. BUT 1) there were still five star reviews coming in as recently as August of 2018; and 2) never underestimate the online reviewer. Like, these people self-identify as arbiters of all that is good (and not good) to buy; do you really think they wouldn’t rush to update their review the minute anything goes wrong?
Besides, let’s be totally honest: as much as we like to talk about the forward march of tech, most of us are still using our computers for the exact same things as we did five years ago. New apps come and go, but we’ll always need to make spreadsheets and type up documents and check our email.
Who knows? Maybe it’s a blessing it’s a little older: it might mean it was unaffected by the Gmail redesign. That’d be worth the price alone, if you ask us!"	0.05			2018-10-15T04:00:05.520Z	0.2839675274780344	0.93	64996

Mr. Khool was the coolest teacher at Meh High. He taught an elective called The Mathematics of Skating, a class he only managed to get approved after bringing the principal to a skate park and catching phat air while explaining how each side of a halfpipe was essentially a graph of exponential growth. Now, he was on his way to teach his first session of it when, rounding a corner, he heard stifled sobs.
Narf, hunched next to the water fountain, tried to straighten up when he saw Mr. Khool approaching. “Oh, hey, Mr. Khool. I was just… uh… making sure the fountains weren’t leaking.”
“Sounds like the only thing leaking are your eyes, l’il guy,” said Mr. Khool, crouching next to him. “You want to talk about it?”
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Narf said. “It’s just… well… I feel like when all the other kids ask for stuff, they get it right away. Toothbrushes. Jerky. Fidget spinners. But I’ve been asking for the same thing for years, and nobody takes me seriously.”
“I know what you’re going through,” Mr. Khool said.
“You do?”
“Sure! Being a cool guy is great, but sometimes it’s hard to get people to take me seriously. They think it’s all kick flips and cliff jumps, when really that’s only like 60 to 70 percent of what I do. There’s also a lot of hard work that nobody gives me credit for. But you know what? Whenever I start to feel like maybe it’s time to trade my longboard in for a Prius, I remind myself: there’s a reason progress and persistence both start with p. A friend of mine told me that once. His name was Tony Hawke.”
Narf’s eyes went wide. “Tony Hawk the skateboarder?”
“No,” Mr. Khool said. “This is Hawke with an e. He was Ethan Hawke’s second cousin. We played in a band together in college. And actually he went by Anthony.”
“So do you just call him Tony Hawke so people think you’re talking about Tony Hawk?”
“It doesn’t matter why I do it,” Mr. Khool said. “The point is, it’s a decision I made to call him Tony. And we all have decisions to make in this life. So, are you going to give up, or are you going to decide to keep chasing your dreams?”
Narf stood up. “You’re right! It doesn’t matter that it’s taken this long! I can’t give up now, not for anything!”
“That’s right! So, what is it that you’ve been asking for?”
“A cat shirt,” Narf said.
“Wait, seriously?” Mr. Khool said, getting to his feet. “But you’re Narf. You’re wearing a cat shirt right now. And you wore one yesterday. And the day before that. And actually every other day too. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the same cat shirt twice, now that I think about it.”
Narf slung his backpack over his shoulder. “Sorry, Mr. Khool. I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve gotta get to chem. Thanks again! You really said exactly what I needed to hear!”
“That’s great,” Mr. Khool said. “Although, maybe we need some other designs?”
But Narf was already off and running to his next class.

Douglas, We’re glad you’re here. We can see you’re confused, but don’t worry: all will be explained. You see, when LeAnn said to come home so you two could “take a scenic flight over a pristine lake” together, she was lying. This is an intervention. We, your friends and family–we’re all worried about you, Douglas.
It all began when you bought that Odyssey Stellar NX Drone. You said it was a way to bond with your son. But you didn’t let Trevor use it much, did you, Douglas? Still, it was a fun hobby for you. You liked that it came with a VR headset, so you could see from the drone’s POV. You would fly it, recharge it, fly it, recharge it, all day.
Only after a few months did we start to see the warning signs. You walked into furniture, cursing your legs. You started standing on the dining table to watch television. You called this “a more natural prospective.”
Then there was the mini drone that came with your purchase of the original drone. You started calling it ‘l’il guy,’ then ‘son,’ then finally you named it. It would’ve seemed cute, if you didn’t choose, ‘Trevor,’ the same name as your real son.
Yes, Douglas, that’s right: only one of them is your real son. Because you are not a drone, Douglas! You are a man! You might spend days coming out of drone-prospective for only as long as it takes your Odyssey to charge. You might spend these times with your eyes closed tight, whispering, “it’s a dream, it’s just a dream,” so as not to face the fact that you are a human being, and as such, you are bound by gravity to remain on the ground.
But it’s not healthy, Douglas! You have a family! You have a job! You have obligations! You can’t just ignore them because you have “a new life in the sky” now. It can be a fun hobby, but you’ll never really be a drone, Douglas. You need to start seeing that. And moreover, you need to apologize to all of us for what you’ve put us through. Let’s start with Trevor.

User @alacrity wants one thing and one thing only: a margarita.
When we sold a Copper Cookware set, they wrote:

well, I guess I could serve margaritas in these…

On a two-pack of posture trainers:

it has to be said: these make really shitty margaritas.

For a 2-pack of cast aluminum skillets:

well, I guess I could drink a margarita out of em… but there’s still the salted rim thing.

A coffee maker:

this will make very hot margaritas.

Earrings:

these are absolutely useless for margaritas.

You might notice that these are not all sales from the last few months. No, @alacrity has lived with desire for years. But that will change today. Because today we are selling a Cuisinart Waring Pro Blade Blender.
And yet the story does not end here. What we want to know is: how does @alacrity feel about this?
Will they arrive at the site today relieved? Will they cry aloud, “For many years I have wished for nothing more than a sweet lime-rich tequila cocktail. And at long last, the great Meh has delivered to me a device that shall itself deliver me to my own personal paradise. Thank you, Meh! Thank you so much!”?
Or will they feel some resentment? Will they realize, all too late, that the real margarita was the friends they made along the way? Or, to put it differently: is there any margarita that’s as sweet on the lips as camaraderie is to the heart?
And yet, there remains a fact we have not reconciled: uhh, like, hello? We’ve sold blenders before!
So perhaps we’re misreading @alacrity. Perhaps, they do not hope for their own margaritas at all. Perhaps they seek only to be a sort of margarita-specific town-crier, to stand in the virtual park at the center of Meh and warn all those around them about the dangers of attempting margaritas in products not optimized for margaritas.
And then of course, there is the final possibility: maybe @alacrity prefers margaritas on the rocks.
So what is it? Only time will tell. And by time, we mean: hopefully @alacrity in the forums."	0.05			2018-10-12T04:00:20.860Z	0.34750686103289724	0.94	59130

Watches? I never wear watches. Why would I wear a watch in the age of cellphones? That’s what I say. Because I believe in efficiency. It guides my every waking move, from the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the time I lay down to sleep at night. (That’s the alarm on my phone, by the way. Why have an alarm clock when you have a cell phone?)
But it’s one thing to say you believe in efficiency, and it’s a whole other thing to live by it. I know because I do. To prove it, I’ll run through my average morning:
First thing’s first, I make breakfast. It’s the same every day: spaghetti and meatballs. I have it for lunch too. And dinner. Food is food, isn’t it? Why should I have different foods for different meals?
When I’m done eating, I floss and brush my teeth, then spit into the drain in my shower. Because why have a sink when you have a shower? Is not a shower a human-height sink? Think about that for a second. Anyway, when I’m done brushing my teeth, I wash my hands with shampoo. Soap-products are soap-products, after all! Then I shave, checking my reflection in the mirror–by which I mean, my phone, on selfie mode.
A little bit of leisure time is part of being efficient too. So, before heading out the door to work, I take twenty minutes to relax. I might watch a show (on my phone) or read a book (on my phone). But soon enough it’s time to check the weather (on my phone). To confirm the app, I look out the window–the single window I have in my whole house. Why do I need to see out my house from so many different sides? Outside is outside, no matter what way you’re looking at it. One window is plenty.
Using this information, I decide what I’m going to wear: pants or shorts. I should elaborate; it’s the one garment, but it’s got a zipper so I can unzip them at the knee when it gets warm. It’s the same pair I wear every day, because again, for me it’s all about efficiency. Not everyone is a fan of this. My sister, for example, once said she actually hated my zip-on pant-shorts. She said I should switch things up by wearing something else sometimes. She said that by wearing them I was ruining her wedding. Can you believe that?
She hasn’t spoken to me since then, but I don’t mind. I still have another sister, and honestly, at the time, I was in the middle of a painful decision of which sister I would keep. Two sisters? Are you crazy? Who needs all that in your life?
Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh, right: these watches. Yep, don’t need them. Although, they would go nicely with the one sweatshirt always I wear, especially on days when it’s hot enough that I have to roll up the sleeves. And if you’re wondering why I don’t just take it off, it’s simple: I’m not wearing anything underneath. Wearing a shirt under what is essentially another shirt?

Imagine for a moment you’re a secret agent. You’ve been called upon to infiltrate a very important party held by a tycoon with designs to take over the world. You need to take a video of the party, so key attendees can be identified, and hopefully sneak into the study where you’re told the plans for the doomsday device are kept. For this mission, you’ll be provided with a PogoCam. It’s smaller than a tube of lip balm, attaches magnetically to your favorite pair of glasses, and shoots 5 megapixel photos and 720p HD videos. You just need to go to Q to collect it.
FYI: in this imagined scenario, Q refers to the dumpster behind the Qwikmart convenience store down the block, not the genius gadgeteer from the movies. Because, boy oh boy, would that guy steer clear of this thing.
In fact, over on Amazon the PogoCam only has 2.5 stars. That’s some real ruh-roh territory, especially given most products fall into a 3 star rating just by being delivered. People who bought it without the Pogotrack sunglasses offered here griped about the safety loop required when using your own pair.  Others complain about the picture quality or that it only takes 30-second video clips.  One user goes even further: “while I have little proof,” LE says, “[I] believe PogoCam has been the cause of much of the world’s turmoil lately.”
Not great!
But here’s the thing: since it’s come out and been revealed to be of less than desirable quality, the PogoCam’s price has tanked. In fact, I’m told that at one point is retailed for as high as $150. That’s nuts. But even with all those price drops, it’s still just shy of 50 on the 'zon.
We’re selling it for $24. For that price, it can just be a fun little gimmicky impulse buy. Wear it once or twice and you’ve pretty much justified the purchase. If you get it to work better than a bunch of Amazon reviewers and find some real use for it, awesome! If not, at least you got some sweet magnetic sunglasses out of the deal.

“Well, sir,” the engineer said, “I like to think of it like this: by adding a number of attention-grabbing but ultimately unnecessary and overcomplicated ‘smart’ features, we’d only introduce the possibility for bugs and glitches. Not to mention we would have to put out different models for different phones and tablets. So, despite how it may seem, this is a ‘smart’ product, in that simplicity is smart, because it leads to ease of use and universal compatibility.”
The CEO pounded his fist on the table. “I like that! I like that a lot! Not smart is actually smart! That’s great! That’s gonna help me a lot, not just at work, but also in my personal life!”

We’re entering the time of year when everything freezes and dies and allergies are replaced by a sense of tired dryness. For some of you, this might be a relief. And yet, consider these two things: first, said dryness does nothing to dry up non-seasonal allergies, like those related to pets; and second, spring will be back sooner than you think with its pollen-thick air. And just like the smart shopper buys next year’s wrapping paper the day after Christmas when it’s marked down to nothing, so too does he or she purchase an allergen-optimized vacuum just as allergy season winds down.
And boy oh boy, does this thing suck up allergies. In fact, it “captures and traps 99.9% of dust and allergens down to 1 micron.” As a non-allergy-sufferer myself, I don’t know exactly what that means. I can tell you that, given the the word “micron” is pretty much just “micro” with an n, it sounds pretty small.
What I actually CANNOT understand is what the fuck “MultiFLEX Technology” is. I know that it “provides flexible reach for under furniture and freestanding, compact storage.” But what does that mean, exactly? Digging a little deeper, I found that the “MultiFLEX wand bends so you don’t have to, reaching under low lying furniture with ease.” So, apparently, it’s a kind of semi-flexible wand? That’s it? Seriously?
But friends, I’m not mad. No, not at all. In fact, I think it’s smart. Genius even! Every feature of every product, regardless of how mundane, should get the marketing-speak treatment. For example:

Yes, on one level, the design is simple: it’s the Meh face, or should we say, the many (meh-ny) Meh faces you see when you come to our site. It’s a button. You press it. You keep a streak going, if you want. Or else you don’t; you reserve the Meh button only to show your nonplussedness. It’s something that makes our site special, a little inside joke among you, the customer, and us.
But, on another level, the design means so much more. It’s a tribute. To us. And all we’ve done for the world of commerce. Before we came along, all was excitement, and much of it was false. Companies didn’t know that it was fine enough to be, well, fine enough. Everything had to be glorious and exuberant. But then we showed up, and we taught people that it doesn’t always have to be that way. You don’t have to worry about moving the proverbial needle. You don’t need to dial it up to a ten. You can hang out at a five if you want.

In this bundle, you get a power bank and a dual USB travel charger (meaning a wall charger with two USB ports). It’s pretty simple, except for one wrinkle, which is that you get to choose what capacity power bank you want: 4200, 6000, or 9000 mAh. Now, most modern phones can be fully charged with between 2000 and 3000 mAh, which means even the smallest power bank we’re offering can charge your phone somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times. By that standard, you could get 2.5 to 3 full charges with a 6000 mAh power bank, and 4.5 to 5 with the 9,000.
But look, we’re not going to spend the next few hundred words talking math. It’s too abstract. The most helpful thing to do would be to provide brief profiles for who might require each power capacity, so that you identify yourself among them. Here goes:

You’ve got a full day ahead of you, enacting archaic rituals and making shady transactions in a number of parks in and around Cincinnati. And let’s just say the Corrigans didn’t factor in any time for you to stop and juice up your phone. Which is a problem, because you need to be face-timing the entire time so they can be sure you don’t call the cops. In short: you’re gonna need some serious recharge power.

You find that you have an intense desire to work out. You go running and clock 18 miles easily. The next day you go further. And further after that.

You’re afraid that if it does, this will all come crashing down. And yet, you’re always setting off on some new adventure. You don’t get a chance to charge that often.

I said YES!!!” or “It’s a healthy baby girl, 7 lbs, 12 ounces!” And you’re responding, “k,” because even typing out a simple “congrats” would take about twenty minutes. And you don’t have that kind of time. Because you’re at a red light. And you’ve gotta look down at the directions you printed out from MapQuest.

Each year, representatives from all 50 European countries gather for the EuroSock Summit to discuss potential changes to the sock’s age-old design. Here is a summary of year’s Summit, which took place in Luxembourg in a chamber deep inside the Grand Ducal Palace:


The representative from Sweden proposed changing the design, so that the sock appeared strangely both modern yet antiquated, like a torture device, but also attractive and entirely comfortable. Motion failed to pass by a vote of 11 to 39.


The representative from Italy proposed making the next EuroSock as soft as the richest pillowy ball of burrata, as delicate to touch as the most sumptuous pluck-able leaves of basil, and yet as firm as tagliatelle cooked to a perfect al dente. Also: more garlic. Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 19 to 31.


The representative from France proposed making the sock from a distinct material that would grow delightfully crusty over night, so to it could be enjoyed the next day. There was some confusion over this, but eventually the representative from France admitted she was simply hungry, having been disappointed in her hotel’s bread options that morning at breakfast. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Norway proposed making the sock seven times thicker. When someone suggested he have multiple pairs of socks–some for summer, others for winter–he smiled and nodded, saying, “Yes, exactly! These would be for summer!” Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 3 to 47.


The representative from Ireland proposed making the socks out of a darker fabric, one “as pitch black as a Guinness.” The representative from Belgium chimed in to add that the fabric should be strong, “not unlike a delicious quadrupel.” The German representative also leaned forward to propose adding a pinch of sea salt, “one of the key ingredients in a traditional gose.” When they all three broke down laughing it became clear that they’d partaken in a few of the aforementioned beverages during the break for lunch. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Lithuania proposed shelving sock-talk for a bit. Instead, she suggested, maybe they should open some rakia, grappa, limoncello, champagne, or what have you and join their Irish, Belgian, and German compatriots, who were obviously having the best time of anybody. Motion passed by a vote of 50-0.

When I first saw that we were selling an air fryer, I was torn.
On the one hand, Wirecutter pretty emphatically stated that they don’t recommend these things for how expensive they are. If you’re not familiar with Wirecutter, they’re basically one of the best and most straightforward resources for when you’re buying kitchen appliances, electronics, and just about everything in between. They do a lot of research and provide simple, easy-to-understand articles replete with concrete purchasing recommendations. So, their opinion carries a lot of weight.
On the other hand, my dad has an air fryer and he likes it.
Two venerable sources. Two contradictory opinions. I didn’t know who to trust. So I began to dig deeper. Here’s what I found:


While working on his Wirecutter article, Michael Sullivan conducted more than 35 hours worth of air fryer tests. In the end, he was so unimpressed with them that he recommended buying a simple convection toaster oven to get a better bang for your buck.


Back when I was in high school, my dad used to change my car’s oil. Not just check it, mind you, but perform a full-blown change. He had a little pit in the garage, so you could pull your car right in and he’d take care of it every 3000 miles.


Given those two facts, I came to the following conclusion: it was possible that my dad had also used his air fryer for 35 total hours, yet it was very unlikely that Michael Sullivan had ever changed the oil in my car when I was in high school. This seemed like a pretty clear “checkmate” situation. But then I remembered that an air fryer’s greatest selling point is its oil-free frying. Thus, it only seemed fair that all oil-based arguments need be discarded. I found myself right back at square one.
Then it hit me: my dad is a Meh customer. He likely bought his air fryer right here on this very site. Meanwhile, Wirecutter suggests a model that retails at about $250, which is FIVE TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS ONE. Furthermore, they never say they’re outright bad; they just say they aren’t worth the money. Which makes sense: my dad would likely not be the satisfied air-frying customer he is today had he been required to fork over more than 200 bucks.
Therefore, Wirecutter, I know we’ve suggested this before, but if you’re reading this, consider an addendum to your initial verdict of “Not recommended”: something like, “unless it’s selling on Meh for almost a fifth of the cost, in which case, go to town.” I’d be happy to put you in touch with my dad if you need any more information."	0.05			2018-10-03T04:00:13.622Z	0.4058992852291472	0.92	65054		0.15524434813545068

In the grand scheme of things, I’m pretty smart about health stuff. No, not necessarily among other humans. I mean in the REAL grand scheme, as in: among all living creatures in the world. I sometimes eat too many donuts, or drink so much coffee that I give myself a headache. But I at least KNOW what I’ve done immediately after I’ve done it. And compared to my cats or my dog, I come out looking like a friggin’ genius!
For example, I won’t find my way into the trash and attempt to consume a giant wad of paper towels that were used to soak up frying oil, only to slink behind the couch and embarrassedly vomit it up. And if I found myself stuck in a bathroom, I would wait patiently until someone got home and ask them for some help. I would not, under any circumstances, try to EAT MY WAY OUT, causing enough damage so that both the door and the trim need to be replaced, and giving myself a pretty rough tummy ache along the way. Another point in my favor: I understand the utility of pills as well as the ease with which they can be taken. They don’t need to be hidden in cheese or loaded into a little plastic contraption to be shot deep into my throat in order to induce swallowing. I just take them!
And yet, even as I type these gloating words, I’m sitting in a rickety wooden chair, leaning awkwardly over my laptop. Unlike the damage of a few too many donuts or a bit too much coffee, I won’t feel the effects of my bad poor posture for many years. And yet, I know this, but I do nothing to correct it.
In a way, poor posture is like the human version of eating out of the garbage. We just can’t help it. Instead of taste-testing rotten meat or chewing on plastic bags, we hunch. And just as pets need help learning what they should and should not do, often for their own good, so do we.
That’s where this this Posture PT Confidence Corrector comes in. It can fit onto just about any chair–from office chairs to the driver’s seat of your car–and it improves posture, which in turn strengthens your core and reduces lower back and shoulder pain. Or, to put it differently, it’s not unlike a spray that makes bad posture smell like sour apples!
Okay, that’s going a little overboard with the pet metaphor thing. It’s not a spray. It’s a posture corrector. Sorry for the confusion. Now buy one, and straighten out your life. Got it?"	0.05			2018-10-02T04:00:03.835Z	0.31486252125742953	0.93	62431

Today’s sale leaves us conflicted. On the one hand, this would seem like an Order/Hoarder sale: you’re given options, some more reasonable than others. On the other, it’s not exactly the same as past Order/Hoarder sales we’ve offered. For example, there are more than two options. So, if you don’t mind, we thought we could work through this together, with a little Q&A:
How does the math break down?
This is a little more complicated than usual. You can get a 40 pack of basic fidget spinners for $14 ($0.35/spinner) or a 40 pack of LED fidget spinners for $16 ($0.40/spinner). But you could also get a 160 pack of both LED and basic fidget spinners (an 80 and 80 split) for $34. Which is about $0.21 per spinner… except, if you think about it: the first 40 basic spinners cost $14 and the first 40 LED spinners cost $16, which adds up to $30. So that’s a mere $4 for the last 80 fidget spinners, or a nickel per! CRAZY!
So then why wouldn’t this be an Order/Hoarder sale?
For three reasons:


As mentioned above, it’s not an either/or. There are three options.


40 fidget spinners will already have you well on your way to hoarding fidget spinners; but, more importantly…

Because fidget spinners are fun and will last longer. Also, this site is run by someone from Saint Louis where some people give out jokes instead of chocolate, so it’s kind of on brand for us to eschew the national standard for Halloween practices.
Wait, back up: what even ARE fidget spinners?
They’re goofy little spinny toys with no real purpose other then to be fidgeted with.
That’s sorta dumb, isn’t it?
You might think so, but in a world where people try to sell peppermint-scented oil as an alternative to physical therapy, I find it refreshing that there’s a product out there that’s explicitly for useless goofings-off.
Hey: fidget spinners. Halloween. Did I see that on the forum?! Is this the third day in a row that you’ve sold something someone suggested you sell, after making a big show about how you don’t take requests on Saturday??

Okay, so, we know how this looks: we go on a rant yesterday about how you can’t just post on the forums and get us to sell whatever you want… then the next day we sell exactly what you’ve been posting about on the forums. Doesn’t really help us reinforce our standing as definitely-not-pushovers.
But really, we’re trying to teach you a lesson. Because you may think that this is what you want, but are you sure? Like, are you REALLY sure?
You might think you want a shirt. And you might purchase one of these–showing the Meh or the Mediocre logo in glossy black ink on a black shirt, a “stealth” logo, if you will–and you might feel satisfied. You might feel a surge of something each time you put it on, a warmth rising in you that you will recognize as not just comfort… but comfort mixed with a sense victory.
You might wear the shirt proudly at first: to work, or out to grab drinks with friends, or when you’re on vacation, or when you’re visiting family. The people around you might ask, “Who made that shirt?” And you might respond: “Meh.” But really, you’ll want to say: “Me. I made it. Or I made it possible. Because had I not badgered them, had I not joined forces with @reclaimercube, the great bringer of the brush, there is a chance–nay, there is a certainty–that they never would have sold this or any shirt ever again.” And you might beam inwardly to yourself.
But many years from now–long after the shirt has got through the cycle: from wear-it-whenever-you-can, to wear-it-sometimes, to laundry-day-only, to pajama-top, to lawn-mowing-shirt, to rag, and finally to trash–you might be driving down a desolate midwestern highway, listening to a true-crime podcast, and you might suddenly remember: all the time you spent on a deal-a-day site’s forum rallying to spend ten dollars on some silly shirt. And you will wonder to yourself: was it really worth all that effort?
And knowing you people, you’ll be like: HELL YEAH! And that’s why we love you.

On September 13th, user @djslack offered up a list of potential things we could sell, including “some kind of interesting jerky type product.” And so here we are selling delicious Wicked Cutz jerky!
Now, we need to make two things clear:
First, this is some pretty classy jerky. Therefore, the price tag isn’t going to be exactly in line with the Slim Jim that you buy on a whim as you check out at the grocery store, only to open it in your car and for the noxious smell to make you regret your decision, although not enough to stop you from eating it. Hypothetically speaking. Point is: this is good jerky and good jerky costs money.
Second, and more importantly: we need to make something EXCEEDINGLY clear. We saw @djslack’s suggestion and considered it, but the decision to sell the jerky ultimately came down to us and us alone. In fact, there’s a chance that we subconsciously were thinking about selling jerky and so @djslack didn’t exactly give us the idea as much as surface it.
What we’re saying is: we’re not necessarily in the business of outsourcing our product selection. As in, we don’t do requests. As in, don’t get used to this, okay? Because this is it. The party ends here.
We say this because ever since we sold some toothbrushes as a joke–that’s right, it was a joke! A joke ON YOU!–we know there have been rumblings on the forums about something you’d like us to sell. That’s how obstinate we are, people: we won’t even name the item. We won’t even write the word. Because we are unmovable.
We’re like a brick wall. People always tell us that. They say, “Talking to you all is like talking to a brick wall.” Which we take as a compliment concerning our strength. And also our attractiveness, given that brick is a very beautiful building material. In certain cases, at least. Maybe not in some of the suburban architecture of the mid-fifties. But then again, those homes have a certain nostalgic beauty in a way. There’s a pure American warmth to them, isn’t there?
What were we talking about? Right: how we’re not a bunch of pushovers, and you can’t boss us around and tell us what to sell!

No, we’re talking about going even further towards singularity. Not just one deal each day. One entire new site selling only one thing per day.
Here’s how it would work if we were launching today. The site would no longer be called Meh. Instead, it would be called something like FLASH! Or, maybe, ILLUMINATR. We’d have a video about flashlights, perhaps a podcast interviewing flashlight experts on the ins-and-outs of responsible flashlight ownership, and then a lengthy write-up explaining the different scenarios in which you might use a telescoping light with a strong magnet, a small cree light with an adjustable beam, and a solar powered light.
There’d be a new logo each day, and more importantly a new URL.

As well as new hires.
Because we would essentially need to build an entirely new team, wouldn’t we? Otherwise, it’d just be a gimmick. And besides, I don’t want a flashlight expert telling me about trowels or copper pans or robot vacuum cleaners. No, we’d have to start from scratch every day. And in the event that something sells out, we’d probably have to have another site. A site of nothing. A sort of meditative anti-consumerism zen space with no purpose aside the absence of all shopping. Which would also need a whole new staff. That would need to be hired midday and let go by the next morning…

Dearest Professor Alba,
First off, a hearty congratulations on winning the Henning Prize. Your self-adhering bow-tie is certainly a masterwork, and the award is absolutely deserved. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the ceremony. As I am sure you are aware, since my expulsion, you are my sole correspondent from the Meyer Institute of Alchemic Fashion. But my choice not to attend is not due to some fear of seeing my former classmates and teachers again–or, more accurately, of experiencing their fear as they witness me. No, I cannot attend because I have fallen ill, and I fear this may be the last letter I ever write.
Although, perhaps ‘fallen ill’ is a simplification, as the illness under which I suffer has no name.
The trouble began in my makeshift lab late one night. I was working on a new stitch technique, making minor tweaks to it here and there over the course of several weeks. It was going nowhere, and after one particularly long day toiling in the haberdashery (with no Meyer Certification, I am forced to do such menial labor), I came home so exhausted and angry that I decided to throw it all away in favor of something entirely new.
I am sure you will be disappointed to hear this. During my expulsion hearings, you were the strongest voice in my favor. When the administration said that I “endangered” all those around me with the “diabolical recklessness” of my work, you told them it was just a phase. But Professor Alba, it was not. And while I am not proud to admit that, I am also not exactly not proud either.
For that evening, in my lab, I created something amazing: a stitch unlike any other stitch; a stitch that seemed to take time into it, that seemed to steal tiny slivers of the universe’s fabric and convert them into pure style. It was a stitch that resembled a stitch in only an ethereal way, like a word in another language whose definition we can on some level understand but for which there is no direct translation. I sewed up some pairs of socks with the stitch; despite using bland monochrome fabrics, each pair came out patterned with a bold unpredictable design.
I learned all too late that it was taking something from me as well, that it was essentially draining my life energy, weaving it among each sock’s seams. I fashioned a lead coat to wear while working, but it was too late. The damage has been done. I write this letter to you from bed, Professor Alba, a bed from which I fear I may never again rise. Indeed, just the act of writing has left me pale and exhausted.
But this is not a letter merely bidding farewell to you and this world. You will find, in the envelope, the detailed plans for the aforementioned stitch (as well as for the protective coat). I cannot say what I want for you to do with them. Some days I hope you will set them aflame and think of them no more; other days I hope you will use them to start a line of vibrant and delightful socks to sell around the world.
But, Professor Alba, promise me this: if you choose the latter, make sure to warn the people, to let them know the truth, that these are not simply stitched socks.
With Eternal Gratitude,

Step 3: Apply blanket to lap and/or legs.
Step 4: Apply purring cat to blanket at lap area. Pet cat occasionally.
Step 5: Apply hand to remote; locate a binge-worthy show on your television; press play.
Step 6: When your significant other or roommate enters the room and asks if you’re really going to spend all day just sitting there watching television, sigh and say, “You’re right,” then move (very slightly) to get up, stopping only to hiss with pain and grasp at the injury area where the first aid was administered. (Optional: parlay sympathy, if shown, into your significant other or roommate bringing you a hot beverage of your choice: coffee, tea, cocoa, or apple cider.)
Step 7: When your significant other or roommate leaves the room, replace purring cat (if riled by your attempt to get up), rewind show as needed, and resume viewing.

Overview: Very good, but not as good as Michael Keaton!!!
Before I get into my review, I want to give you a little bit of background: I’m a huge Michael Keaton fan and a software developer. Recently, I sold my start-up to a large tech conglomerate for several million dollars. I used that money to build a bunker inside an abandoned warehouse where I would live and wait for Michael Keaton to arrive so I can ask him a few continuity-related questions about his seminal 1996 comedy, Multiplicity, for my podcast: The Podkeast. I won’t list the questions here because I am certain they’ve never been asked and I want to be sure I’m the ones who asks them (more on this below, when I get into the complaints).
I need peace in my bunker to record episodes of The Podkeast and also to meditate and prepare myself for the eventual interview. Luckily, it’s soundproof. That brought up another issue, though: if I can’t hear anything, how will I know when Mike (that’s what I call him in my head sometimes) has arrived?
That’s where The Lynx 1080P Camera comes in! The quality’s great, they’re easy to set up, there’s free cloud storage, and most importantly, it has facial recognition. Using photos, I trained mine to only recognize one face: Michael Keaton’s. Thus, I’ll get a check-in notification whenever he arrives (fingers crossed, any day now!). Any other unfamiliar face alerts that come through I just ignore, because like I said, I don’t need the distractions.
I should say: I do have two complaints. One is that the Lynx recognizes faces really well, but not always the material said faces are made of. What I’m getting at is that my mom keeps showing up in a really realistic Michael Keaton mask (she probably bought it with the start-up money I gave her, ugh!). She always says the same thing: that she’s worried I might be losing my mind. It makes me want to scream. Like, of course I’m losing my mind! I got a check-in notification and thought Michael Friggin’ Keaton was here! And sometimes I do scream. Hey, it’s a sound-proof bunker, gotta get your money’s worth, right?
The other complaint I have is that Michael Keaton has not shown up to do the interview with me. This is probably more a don’t-have-Michael-Keaton’s-contact-info problem than a Lynx problem, but still: with that AND the mask issue, I didn’t feel right giving it five stars.
Overall, though, a very good camera!"	0.05			2018-09-24T04:00:11.601Z	0.2044531578210335	0.94	74861

When it comes to celebrating milestones, different people demand different amounts of ceremony. Some will require you to wear tuxedos and dinner gowns to the their wedding in a restored factory-turned-theater-space, wherein they will prepare a choreographed song and dance commemorating the various defining moments of their relationship. Others will go to the courthouse, sign a few documents, and send a text imploring you to meet them for beers later.
Whether it be a birthday, a successful defense of a PhD dissertation, or a housewarming party–everyone’s a little different. Not everyone wants gifts. But herein lies the one consistent rule, regardless of an event’s formality: if you’re bringing a gift, you have to put it in something festive. Because even the most casual soon-to-be mom isn’t going to stoked when you show up with a onesie still in the shipping box from VintageOnsiesRUs․com.
The problem? Wrapping is stressful. Wrap a gift poorly and you look like a degenerate. Wrap a gift too ornately and you seem like a bit of an over-achiever. Besides, not everything is easy to wrap. If you want to wrap an overstuffed plush starfish, you can either a) put it in a box and wrap that, or b) get your friend who’s an aerospace engineer to help you get the measurements and scissor placement just right so that it doesn’t come out looking like garbage.
Really, your best bet is to put that overstuffed plush starfish into a gift bag. Because the gift bag always looks good. It’s as fun-looking as wrapping paper and as easy as a shipping box. Plus, getting a gift in a gift bag rules. You’re basically getting two gifts, one of which you’re more than encouraged to regift later when you need to give someone else a gift.

For those are unfamiliar, Order/Hoarder is when we offer you two options: a normal number of things for a good price, or an abnormally large number of things for a GREAT price. Today’s product:
Cooling towels!!!
So, let’s break it down:
The Math
“You can’t put a price on cool.” That’s something someone said in a movie once. It doesn’t matter who or what movie or if I just made it up, because it’s not true. You can put a price on being cool.
For example, if you just want to be double-cool (as in, get two cooling towels) you have to pay $12. That comes down to the totally reasonable per towel price of $6 (especially considering they’re $10 over on Amazon).
Now, here’s where it gets a bit more complicated. As we like to point out on these sales, when figuring out the price per unit of the Hoarder order, it’s not as simple as dividing the overall price ($36) by the number of units (12). BECAUSE, your can choose either 2 or 12, no in-betweens. Therefore, if you think about it, you’re already paying $6 for each of the first 2 towels, which means the last 10 towels are only costing you $24, or a mere $2.40 per towel! How about that deal, huh?!
What you can do with a normal order
It’s pretty simple. Cooling towels are not exactly all that, well, cool, but they are functional. With just two of them, you can use one as your main post-workout cool-down towel, and give the other to your spouse or partner. Or you can cycle through both yourself so you don’t have to do laundry as often.
What can you do with a Hoarder order
So much more! Here are just a few suggestions:


Go a day early and leave a cooling towel at each mile marker of your upcoming 20K race, so you never have to worry about getting too hot.


Take all of them and fashion them into a suit or cocktail dress to wear to outdoor weddings. But would a suit or dress made out of cooling towels really be classy enough for something like that? you might ask. To which we would respond: Could it be any less classy than a suit or dress soaked with sweat?


Sure, you could spend a bunch of money on an air conditioner and then a bunch of more money each month to run it. Or, you could save some cash by sewing yourself a delightful cooling towel quilt!


They’d make a great napkin alternative at your 12-guest “super spicy food banquet”.


Are you a do-gooder teen? Do you often dream of fashioning rope ladders out of clothes and blankets to lower yourself out your 2nd story bedroom window so you can run around after bedtime with your new rebellious friends? Only, your palms get so sweaty that you can’t get a good grip? Gosh, if only you could make a rope ladder out of something cool and soothing to the touch!


See? Maybe we were wrong. Maybe 12 cooling towels isn’t an unreasonable amount of cooling towels at all. On the other hand, you still have the option of buying the (completely boring) 2-pack. The decision is yours!
So what’s it gonna be? Are you going to place an order? Or become a hoarder?"	0.06			2018-09-22T04:00:05.871Z	0.20048520789810637	0.96	62757

Generally, we don’t support the silencing of artists. Except here, where you can use Karaoke Creator to suppress the vocal frequencies of a song (and shift the key) so one of your friends can do a much shittier rendition of it.
Crossfader lets you transition seamlessly from one song to the next.
It also has something called “Party Thruster” which involves sliding a “throttle” that allows you to “hear the party build up until you hit maximum party at which time the system booms and the lights go crazy.”

We have no complaints about this LG Hi-Fi Entertainment & Karaoke System.
Honestly, it seems pretty cool. With 1000 watts, it’s got plenty of power. Plus, it’s got a wide range of features that’ll help you “pump up the party” as the youth say. For example, the Crossfader allows you to blend songs together seamlessly. And the Karaoke Creator can suppress the vocals of a given track and then shift the key to one that better suits the karaoke singer.
It also has something called “Party Thruster” which allows you to “hear the party build up until you hit maximum party at which time the system booms and the lights go crazy.” If you’re unsure of what that means, maybe this, from the instruction manual, will help paint a clear picture:

Sounds like a pretty quick party if you ask me, but I’m told it happens to a lot of guys.
So again, we have no complaints about this particular karaoke system. Our complaint is about karaoke in general, or, to be more specific, about the musical artists we so often choose NOT to sing. That’s right: I’m talking about birds. Despite being nature’s original songwriters, you rarely hear anyone at a karaoke night sing a song by the many great bird-fronted musical groups out there, such as:

Oriole Speedwagon,
Cardi(nal) B,
Chirp Trick,
The Coo-Coo Dolls,
David Crowie,
Squawking Heads,
The Beaksie Boys,
The Sparrowling Stones,
Nine Finch Nails,
Pengwen Stefani,
Red Hot Chili Pipers,
Macawl McCartney,
Fowrener,
Kendrake Lamar,
The Flamingo Lips,
Ibis Markie,
Kelly Larkson,
Kingphisher,
or The Killers (of Worms & Field Mice).

It’s ridiculous, really! These are some of the greatest musicians to ever roam the skies, and they get no recognition. But you can change that. All you need to do is buy this LG Hi-Fi Entertainment & Karaoke System. Then, come your next karaoke party, make it a rule: only bird bands.

Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a child. Let’s call him @Dave. Dave wore Sears-brand Toughskin jeans. They were, as their name implied, durable and long-lasting. But, like most economically practical things, corners needed to be cut to keep them affordable, and, unfortunately for Dave, the corner Toughskin jeans cut was the let’s-make-these-things-look-cool corner.
Or maybe not unfortunately. Because Dave rarely felt self-conscious in his Toughskin jeans. What did make him feel self-conscious was when, in the mid-80s, his grandparents splurged and got him a Generra sweatshirt. It was “in.” Very “in.” In fact, you could say that it was so deeply “in” that the brand couldn’t find its way out of the decade.
Suddenly, all the other kids at school were stopping Dave in the hallway to say, “Cool sweatshirt,” and, after years of remaining invisible behind the Toughskin curtain, he didn’t know how to react to such a compliment. It was uncomfortable.
Dave has come a long way since then… or has he? No, he doesn’t wear Toughskin jeans anymore, but he still has a Toughskin mindset. He’s not afraid of bright purple laptops or speakers that are loud in both function and design. This, in some ways, is his calling: espousing the virtues of things that don’t look exactly like you’d hope but work just fine.
But he doesn’t exactly know what to do with these slick-looking Rowkin Bluetooth Ear Buds.
Does he say: just because Meh sells some stuff that has substance but lacks style does NOT mean the stylish stuff we sell lacks substance in equal measure? Does he point out that many of the negative reviews on Amazon that have driven the average rating down to an unimpressive 3 stars can be put into 3 categories:

people complaining about the hefty (non-Meh) price tag;
people who struggled with a weird issue that was corrected easily by a factory reset; and
people hating on Bluetooth technology as a whole?

Does he mention that many reviews were impressed with both their size and sound quality (and again, that those people were reviewing after, presumably, paying some 50 bucks more the price they are offered at here)?
No. @Dave does none of these things. He has a copywriter do it, duh."	0.05			2018-09-20T04:00:02.850Z	0.2538143856831479	0.92	72743

As we’ve mentioned before, we recently won an auction for a storage locker that was filled entirely with branded content romance novels. Or so we thought. But, picking through the titles, we actually found many belonged to a branded content epic fantasy series by the author L.L.R. Holdien about a warrior named Tarklaw The Powerful. Luckily for us, there’s a chapter in book 19 about today’s product, the Keysmart (and Keysmart Pro).

Having successfully freed the shape-shifting wizard Vintel, son of Filor The Great, from the floating prison of Delkabana, narrowly escaping the light-spears of the Meschlen Guards by leaping through a portal leading somewhere that only a seer like Wise Crin might intuit–Tarklaw found himself deposited into murky waist-high water.
“Vintel?” Tarklaw called out, trying to locate the wizard whom he had just a moment ago saved, despite their families’ centuries-long acrimonious relations.
“I’m right here, Tarklaw,” Vintel seemed to whisper into his ear, buzzingly. “As a shape-shifting wizard, it is my custom to acclimate my shape to the environs, and so I have taken the form a mosquito because we, bitter-family-enemy-turned-savior, appear to be in a swamp.”
“Not just any swamp! The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors!” came a voice that belonged neither to Tarklaw or Vintel, but another in their vicinity. Tarklaw turned quickly, drawing his great sword with a shing sound common of sword-drawing. But he found only a small creature not unlike an unshelled tortoise, swimming towards them. “Forgive me for startling you! I am Rewn, peaceful leader of the Melorians, the primary inhabitants of this swamp at the edge of the Planet Glor at the far reaches of the Heplan Galaxy. Now, I imagine you’ve come here through some pesky portal or other, but fear not: your exit is easily made through one of the Eight Astounding Doors.”
“Doors?” Said Tarklaw. “I am from the planet Phentalon, a place without doors, due to our peoples’ openness with each other.”
“Very noble,” Rewn said. “Perhaps one day, The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors shall be like that. For now, you must choose one. They go to any number of worlds, from the euphorically beautiful mountain-scape of Relan to the hellish fire-deserts of Dumask. And we have all the keys right here…” Rewn dipped under the water for a moment, but re-emerged with a perplexed look upon his creaturely face. “Oh, dear! They were right there a moment ago.”
“You simply allow all keys to be strewn throughout a swamp?” buzzed Vintel.
“Not exactly,” Rewn said, explanatorily. “We keep them all together using an ingenious contraption known as a KeySmart. Made of aircraft aluminum, it can hold eight keys–or as many as fourteen, with an expansion pack! Additionally, it includes a loop for keys belonging to vehicles propelled by motors. Not to mention, its extended frame can hold long or foreign keys, which is especially important to us, as one of our oldest and most prized keys is made from the hollow bird-like finger bone of the fallen Hilderan Mage Lazlorn.”
“But,” Vintel buzzed, contrarily, “as ingenious and organizationally optimized as that all sounds, it seems at present not to be helping in your ability to locate them.”
“Ah, yes, that would be true if it were the base model, which is still good,” Rewn said. “Luckily for us, we opted for the Pro. Not only does it have a built-in LED flashlight and bottle opener; it can also show a map of your missing keys, and by way of the Tile app–which can be accessed via your smartphone or tablet–you can make your keys ring out loud! Of course, I should add at this juncture that the ‘water’ here in the The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors is different in elemental makeup to that of the water on other planets, such as Earth.”
“Are you saying,” Vintel buzzed, clarifyingly, “that just because we are discussing the KeySmart Pro being used in a water-based situation, it should not be taken as an endorsement of it being waterproof?”
“Exactly,” cried Rewn, disclaimingly.
“Much like doors, smartphones and tablets are concepts foreign to my home world,” Tarklaw said. “But that sounds like a great functional product nonetheless.”
“And I will show you just how functional it is!” Rewn cried with excitement. He brought forward a device and opened the Tile app. A moment later, a ding rang out, though it sounded muffled. The three of them turned… and stood facing a giant glowing snake-like beast. It emerged from the water, standing nearly forty Glorian theltans tall, or forty feet tall in Earth measurements, Glorian theltans being exactly equal to terrestrial feet. The ding sounded again, from somewhere deep inside of the monster’s abdomen.
“Oh no! A Mirelord! Run!” Rewn cried with fear. “Or, better yet, swim.” And with that, he disappeared under the water.
But Tarklaw did not swim away. He crouched into a combat ready position as best he could in the deep murky water. The Mirelord leaned closer to him, its eyes alight with evil.
“What are you doing?” buzzed Vintel into his ear, questioningly.
“We must get out of this swamp,” Tarklaw cried. “This is the only way. Though, it will be hard for just the two of us to defeat it…”
“Perhaps, I can help?” came a distinguished voice from Tarklaw’s side.
Tarklaw turned, and saw… no! He couldn’t believe it! “Hinton, son of Raquille, wielder of The Great Axe Of Orlagos, and best friend since birth of Tarklaw The Powerful? But I thought you were–”
“The immortal prisoner of the Inter-dimensional Pirate Lop, locked away in the his ship, The Pummeling Ewlok, for all of eternity?” Hinton laughed. “Not a chance in Dumask, my friend! Now, what do you say we free the aforementioned product from the belly of the beast? Just like old times?”
Tarklaw couldn’t help but smile. “Just like old times, indeed,” he said, and they raised their weapons to the approaching Mirelord."	0.05			2018-09-19T04:00:10.856Z	0.34612555704581827	0.93	72268

One time, I left without remembering to close the door.
I was living in a house somewhere so rural we didn’t need to lock up, and, in a rush to leave (I was going on a trip), I forgot to swing the door all the way closed, leaving only the screen door between my cat and freedom. He was fine. My mom checked on him the next day and, much to her surprise, he emerged from under the deck after spending what must’ve been, for an indoor cat, a terrifying night outside.
Just about every time I have left the house since then, even if just for an hour, I have wondered: “did I close the door? Did I lock the door? Do the pets have food? Do they have water? Did I leave the oven on? Did I unconsciously light seven candles and place them precariously close to window curtains that are, unbeknownst to me, highly flammable?” Many times, I have gone back to check. Never have I left the stove on. Never have I found candles flickering. The pets have always been fine. Only once or twice have I found the door unlocked.
Still, I never regret it, because it’s nicer to know everything’s fine than it is to hope everything’s fine.
And that’s really what these Zmodo MeShare cameras are for: making sure. You can call them “security cameras,” but that feels a little overstated. Maybe it would be better to rebrand them as “check-in cameras.” After all, the chances that you’re going to tune in as your home is being burglarized–thus allowing you to call the authorities while the burglary is in progress–is very low. I mean, hell, the actual likeliness of your home being burglarized at all is very low. And if your first thought upon reading that is, Nuh-uh, my home gets broken into all the time, we won’t argue with you. But we will say: you probably need more than a couple Zmodos.
Otherwise, these are a good option for the second-guessers out there to quell all the concerns that might flare up during your day at work: whether you just want to make sure everything’s fine, or to check that you didn’t forget to close the windows, or to monitor whether your dog is feeling okay after eating something stupid that he wasn’t supposed to…

Every time they sit down they’ll think, “Hey, you know what: I’m special!” And this confidence will push them to do great things.
Game Room

Checkers is simple and boring on a board… but what about in a room, with you and all of your friends as the pieces? To make it more exciting: institute a rule where it’s not as easy as just “jumping” another piece; instead, you have to battle for it. Whoever doesn’t get cast into one of the empty spaces (i.e. onto the floor) wins!

Think about it: you cover the floor of your kitchen, wall-to-wall, with Sactionals, and now, suddenly, you can drop a glass or a ceramic mug and it won’t shatter! Plus, they’re machine washable, in case there’s a spill. Best of all, if you need to keep an eye on something you’ve got baking, you can just lay down next to the oven and watch it!

Dear @reclaimercube,
On September 2nd, you posted the following comment on a knife sale:

Meh I have anxiously been awaiting for you to post a toothbrush for sale again. I will post this everyday until you finally sell another one again.

And, @reclaimercube, can we tell you something? We’re very proud of you. Because you kept your word. Since then, each day, you’ve put forward this same request.
Your fellow Meh customers began to notice. One post from Friday, September 7th sparked a discussion that involved more than 20 comments. In that conversation, someone pointed out a toothbrush for sale on a competitor’s site. You, ever strong, refused to take the bait:

not a bad deal… But not on meh so it doesn’t matter. You could link me to colgate’s website or crest’s website for a free toothbrush and I still wouldn’t want it unless it was on meh. I’m chaining myself to this statue. Ride or die mehbrother.

Your repeated request did not specify why you wanted a toothbrush, or what kind of toothbrush you wanted. Really, you haven’t even promised that you’d buy the toothbrush. You’ve only asked, repeatedly, for us to “post a toothbrush.”
Well, good news, @reclaimercube: when we launched Meh, we made a decision. Once, and only once, we would allow a Meh customer to dictate exactly what we’d sell. The only rule was they had to make the request for 13 consecutive days. They could ask for $1 MacBooks, or free puppies, or Cadillac Escalades filled with cash. It didn’t matter. There were no restrictions, aside from the 13 days. Some of us worried the financial hit would be too much, but others felt assured: we could trust our customers! They wouldn’t make unreasonable demands!
So thank you, @reclaimercube; you’ve shown us that our faith was not misplaced. Now, Meh community, let’s all come together and celebrate with this build-your-own-bundle of toothbrushes.

Hair: it is the ultimate example of disobedience.
You can train puppies to pee outside, to walk next to you, to sit, to shake, to do any number of fun and/or useful things. With cats, the job is much harder, but with some persistence (and a spray bottle) it is possible to enforce a few rules: you do not yowl in the middle of the night, you do not walk on the kitchen counter, you do not knock our decorative trinkets off the mantle as a game. Even a bonsai can be coaxed, over time, to grow a certain way.
But not hair. Nope, no matter how many times you comb, shave, style, epilate, and wax: it can just never take the fucking hint!
You know that person in your  your life who’s like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “hmm, maybe?” And you hope they’ll just drop it, but then a day later, they’re like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “I don’t know if that dumb thing is really a good idea.” Which should be clear as hell, but they don’t want to listen, so they keep prodding and prodding until you’re like, “Look,  I don’t want to do the dumb thing because it is dumb, and honestly, I’m worried you might be dumb for suggesting it, and I might be dumb for being the friend of such a dumb person.” And you feel terrible but they just smile and say, “C’mon! It’ll be great!”
That’s hair. No matter how many times you try to send the message that you don’t want it to come back there, it keeps coming back there. It is untrainable!
Or is that the wrong way to look at it? Could it be that we are the untrainable ones? That our hair is not being a stubborn learner but a tenacious teacher? That it wants to lead us to a better place? A place where we eschew the standards of beauty thrust upon us? Because isn’t it pretty arbitrary where we say there should be hair and where we say there should not? On the head is good, but not on the face? Except some faces capable of growing thick enough hair? On the chest is okay, but no, never on the back? Not on the legs, but okay on the arms, except in the armpits? Could it be that our hair’s persistence is its way of saying: you need to get the hell over it and just be who you are?

The three brothers had been cleaning out their grandfather’s basement for nearly two hours before they found the FoodSaver.
“What’s this?” said Kyle, holding it up.
“Looks old,” said Jake. “I’d guess circa second half of the 2010’s.”
Terry took it from Kyle and inspected it. “Wait, I know these things. It’s an early model weed-sealer. You know? The devices for vacuum-packing weed so it wouldn’t go bad.”
“All this talk of weed remind me, have you guys taken your three o’clock edibles yet?” Jake asked.
Kyle and Terry nodded.
“But wait,” Kyle said, “why does it say FoodSaver on it, if it’s for weed?”
“You have to understand, Kyle, this was before weed was legal everywhere,” Terry explained. “They didn’t even put it in the water back then!”
Kyle looked at the FoodSaver perplexed. “Really?”
“I’m serious,” Terry said. “So people weren’t as acclimated to it as we are now. They considered it a drug. Thus, when people took some, they got ‘high,’ which basically meant they thought without logic. So it’s likely that the inventor of the ‘FoodSaver’ only named it such because he was super high, and probably pretty hungry.”
“So strange to think that the same substance that keeps us calm and measured, used to have almost the opposite effect!” Kyle said.
Now Jake had the FoodSaver. “Are you sure this is a weed-sealer? To me, it looks like an early sous-vide-assistant. That would make more sense with the FoodSaver name.”
“Did they even sous vide back then?” Terry asked.
“Sure,” Jake said. “It was more of a luxury, though, given that it was before the Microwave And Oven Act of 2035.”
“When I read about those times, and all the negative-energy-pollution caused by those now illegal kitchen appliances, it just makes me sick,” Terry said.
“Guys, you’ve got me thinking…” Kyle paused to gather his thoughts. “Well, you know how when we put stuff in the freezer, it just freezes together and gets covered in weird ice?”
“They’re called water diamonds, Kyle,” Terry said.
“They mean the moisture has accepted the food, so we know it’s safe to eat,” Jake said.
“I’m well aware of them and what they mean. Don’t forget, I’m the one who studied health at Dove For Men Presents: College. But I was thinking, the food doesn’t always taste good after the water diamonds form.” Kyle took the FoodSaver from Jake. “And I know this is going to sound crazy, but if this thing could keep weed fresh, and be used with food products for sous-vide purposes, maybe we could combine the two functions. Like, we could use it to seal food before we freeze it so it stays fresher longer.”
“You mean, you want to eat food that’s been frozen but hasn’t emitted its proper water diamonds?” Terry said.
“Isn’t that illegal?” Jake added.
“Sure, on Earth. But not here,” Kyle said, “on Mars.”
Jake and Terry had to admit he had a point: they definitely had been on Mars this whole time."	0.05			2018-09-13T04:00:05.184Z	0.21097046413502127	0.92	62121

As someone who doesn’t brush his hair much, Wet Brushes look, to me, like normal brushes. But looks can be deceiving. Or, in this case, the looks are deceivingly simple. In truth, everything I’ve read about them states, quite simply, that they’re best brushes around. And today, we’re selling a pack of three: one pro, one pop fold, and one paddle.
They’re all designed specifically to brush out tangles without pain or tugging. They work especially well on wet hair, but can be used on dry hair too, even wigs and extensions. The paddle features “AquaVents” that help with ventilation and drying as you brush. In short, they sound great. But again, I don’t brush my hair really ever, so if you don’t want to take my word for it–or the word of the many happy customers over on Amazon–then maybe these totally real reviews from absolutely not-made-up hair professionals will help seal the deal:

“Great brushes,” says Hairrison Ford.
“I love mine,” says Braid Pitt.
“The best,” says Julia Stylist.
“Top shelf stuff,” says David Mulletterman.
“My favorite,” says Follicle․i․am.
“Excellent products,” says Scarlet Johansbun.
“The only name I trust,” says David Sprayed.
“Fantastic value,” says Gel-ly Clarkson.
“Just awesome,” says K.D. Bang(s).
“Use mine every day,” says Partin’ Lawrence.
“Why get the rest when you can have the best?” says Pompadoris Burke.
“Bloody good stuff,” says Hairy Styles.
“A triumph in brush-making,” says Kate Brush.
“One thumb up, because I’m using my other thumb to hold a Wet Brush,” says Ethan MoHawke.
“Hands down, the greatest,” says Mariah Hair-Carey.
“Hot take: they’re amazing,” says James Comby, former director of the FBI (Federal Bureau of Interesting-Hair-Styles).

The Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet is pretty simple: it’s a wallet that comes with a powerpack, which can be used to charge your phone or other devices.
In a way, to recharge something is to refill it, but unfortunately, while the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet does fill your wallet in the literal sense–like, there is a powerpack inside of it–it can’t refill your wallet in the figurative sense–as in, recharge your bank account.
Or can it?
Because think about this: what kind of phone is the most likely to have a short battery life? An old phone! And maybe you have an upgrade waiting for you, but you don’t want to dish out the money for one. Because maybe, with your provider, it’s not as simple as handing over $200 and getting a new iPhone. Now, you pay for the upgrade via a small increase in your monthly bill–a small increase that over time accumulates into a lot of money. And it’s very possible that this change was made because people like you: people who buy a phone and then ride it into the ground, thus spending a couple hundred bucks every six years, rather than evert two like your cell company–let’s call them Werizon–would prefer.
And so now you’ve got a geriatric phone that needs a pick-me-up every few hours to make it through the day, and you’re not always near an outlet, so one of these Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallets–‘wallets’ plural because you get a 2-pack–is just what you need. It’s your wallet, so it’s not like you’ll forget it. Thus, you’ll always have some charge on hand, which means you don’t need to upgrade, which means your phone bill won’t go up, which means you’ll save money, which, in conclusion, means the Adrienne Vitadini Charging Wallet can, in fact, recharge both your phone and your wallet!

I remember being a kid, riding in my parents’ car at night, and dropping something. Maybe a toy or a quarter. It doesn’t matter what. What matters is I reached up and turned on the dome light to find the object in question. And it was then that my dad freaked the fuck out. You would’ve thought I’d tossed hot acid in his eyes. “Turn that off! I can’t see anything!” he claimed. He might’ve even swerved a little, for emphasis. As a dutiful child, I switched the light off as quickly as possible to avoid careening off the road into a ditch.
Flash forward some years: I have a license. I have a car. A friend is riding with me. He turns on the dome light for something and… everything is fine.
The same thing happened the first time I helped jumpstart a car. I’d been told so many times about everything that can go terribly wrong that I felt sure that it would end in a) an deadly storm of electricity and fire; or b) one or both of the cars being fried for good. Turns out, if you, ya know, just follow instructions, it works out fine.
If anything, the greatest risk of jumping a car–the one that no amount of how-to articles or Youtube videos can save you from–is the risk of wasting a favor. Because think about it: you spend all that time being a good friend and building up positive equity until you’ve almost got enough to cash in for pet care or help shlepping some furniture from your old apartment to your new one… Then your car battery farts out and now your buddy is driving over in the cold to help you get it started again.
That’s where this iJoy Jump Starter Kit comes in. Not only will it charge your phone and provide some you with some light; it’ll make it so that you don’t need to dip into the favor bank just to get your car running.

Roy laughed. Not at the man but at the theory the honk had charitably eradicated from his mind. Lorraine couldn’t be the Scarlet Savior. Sure, they both had striking red hair, but the Scarlet Savior always wore a matching Treasure Island jewelry set–one necklace, one bracelet, both made out of genuine gemstones and pearls–whereas Lorraine wore a single longer Treasure Island necklace, which was also made of genuine gemstones and pearls.
Well, that settles that! Roy thought. And just in time too! Because here she came, the Scarlet Savior, flying through the sky, blazing a red path through the sky that, strangely, looked like it originated on the roof of the Gazette’s offices.

For those keeping score at home: that’s now a $9 difference between the two.
In some ways, this isn’t simply a sale; it’s an experiment. We want to answer the question: what is a zipper truly worth?

There are three potential outcomes to buying this Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk:
Outcome 1
You buy the standing desk. You’re intrigued by its promises of a stronger core, healthier circulation, improved productivity, and better posture. But the truth is, you don’t care for it. You’ve spent your entire life believing that getting work done requires sitting down and shutting up. So how do you expect, as an adult, to change your working position? Maybe if you gave it more time… but you don’t want to. You just want to use it as a normal desk. And that’s fine! Because this thing didn’t cost north of $600 like some models out there; it cost less than $200. And look, that’s not nothing, but it was a worthwhile gamble.
Outcome 2
You love your new standing desk. But it’s not enough. Once you taste the thrill of working upright, you want more. You quickly replace your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk with a treadmill desk. You start out walking, but soon enough you’re outright sprinting while you manage your spreadsheets and respond to emails. You get a kiddy pool and set it up behind the treadmill, filling it with a medley of pirañas and water moccasins. Now, any slowdown and you’re in trouble. But even that’s not enough. You take out the water moccasins, extract their venom, and put it in an IV that runs directly into your arm. The anti-venom is in another IV that you’ve rigged to only administer as you meet your hourly sales goals. Your friends and family members are worried about you, but you’ve never felt more alive! And it all started with the Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk!
Outcome 3
You get your Cool-Living Adjustable Stand Up Desk, and you like it. You crank it up to standing height for a few hours of the day; for the rest of the time, you use it as a normal desk. You’re neither disappointed, nor unsatisfied. It meets your needs, and you will use it for the foreseeable future.

Shaving is the blandest and yet most grueling task of every personal grooming regimen. It is a zero sum game: you can put it off, but that only means it’ll be a longer and more grueling process when eventually you do get around to it. It’s like mowing the lawn, except without the exercise, and the smell of fresh cut grass replaced by the noxious chemical odor of shave gel. In short, it’s miserable.
Or it was. Until now. Enter these “Famous Maker” razors. Famous Maker? you say. But who IS the famous maker? That’s just the thing, we can’t tell you. And now suddenly, shaving is an act of immeasurable mystery and excitement!
Could it be that these razors are the excess produced by an underground razor factory located far below Park City? Perhaps for the original purpose of being distributed, in secret, to the agents and publicists and personal assistants of actors in town for the Sundance Film Festival? So that these various agents and publicists and assistants could sneak into the actors’ hotel rooms at night and shave their faces clean while they slept? Because maybe the actors, having escaped the always-on environs of Los Angeles, wanted to let themselves go, but the various men and women whose livelihoods relied on their pristine image had other things in mind?
Or could it be that the razors are from a different hidden factory, a facility built into the side of one of the Alps? For a baron? A baron who volunteered to host the worldwide beard and mustache contest at his expansive villa? While harboring a secret hatred of all facial hair? And so the plan was not to celebrate these growers of elaborate beards and mustaches, but to trap them and then use the razors to, as the baron said in a private correspondence, “reveal their cheeks upper lips once again to the world”? Maybe he even wanted to shave the hair on their head too, just to prove a point? Only his scheme was discovered by the lowly helper-boy tasked with taking his correspondence to the post office? And so the baron had no choice but to sell off his stock of razors in an effort to cut (pun intended) his losses?
Or could it be a pretty basic story of a razor company having some leftover razors that they wanted to offload? Only they couldn’t do so under their own name? Because then people would be like, “but wait, I just spent this much on these at the store, but now you’re selling them for cheap online? That’s bullshit!”?
Okay, for purposes of whimsy, let’s just ignore that last scenario. Instead, focus on the first two, buy these razors, and shave with an entirely new sense of intrigue!"	0.05			2018-09-05T04:00:15.298Z	0.26119278036366067	0.93	62903

The actors threw up their hands. The camera man shook his head. The boom operator brought the boom mic booming to the ground in disgust.
“What,” the director said, “is that infernal noise?”
“Sorry,” said the PA. “It’s my light. It ran out of battery so I had to crank it.”
“Didn’t I tell you to crank this morning, to make sure it had enough charge to light the scene?”
“Yeah, you did,” said the PA, “But, sir, I gotta be honest, I don’t think this is the right light for a film set. I mean, I could see the utility of having one at your house.

Can I level with you here: I’m just not much a knife guy. I have a set of good kitchen knives and that’s about it. I open boxes with my keys cut through frustrating packaging with a pair of scissors. I don’t mean any judgment. I’m just being honest. The problem is, I have to write about this knife, and I can’t just say, “Uh, I don’t know? It’s fine, probably?”
Or so I thought…
Then I went to do some research on Amazon and saw a question about what material was used to make the pivot washers and how thick the blade is. The first answer reads as follows:

Sorry, this was a gift for someone in Arizona so I can’t answer your question. I can only say that the knife is substantial!

Wait, seriously? This is allowed? Admitting that you don’t know the answer… counts as an answer?! Well then friends, I’ve got some great news: I can answer all the questions you have about this 2-Pack of C.R.K.T. Ruger Go-N-Heavy Compact VEFF Serrated Knives! Let’s do it!
So, how thick is the blade?
Great question! I’d guess that it’s probably about the same as other knives like it, although it could be thicker. But even then, it wouldn’t be too much thicker, because that would be weird, right?
I’m reading that it has a “stonewashed drop-point blade.” That sounds intense. What kind of stuff can you use it for?
I bet it would be pretty good at cutting through most stuff you’d use a knife like this for, but I don’t feel comfortable naming specific stuff because I’ve never used one. I will say this, though: there’s a good chance it can cut through butter. And an even better chance if the butter has been left out of the fridge for a little while.
Was it designed by Bill Harsey?
Sure was! As to who Bill Haresay is, lol, idk! I would venture to guess he does something in the knife industry.
One reviewer says that it is 11.8"" long when it’s extended. Is that longer than other knives?
Not sure. It is definitely not as long as a foot, because a foot is 12"". With that being said, another reviewer posted a photo of it next to another knife and a tape measurer, if that helps. It is bigger than the other knife, but not the tape measurer (which is good, because those things can get really long).
Wow! This is so easy! It’s great to finally realize how much a knife expert I really am! Thanks Amazon question answerer, for showing me the way.

This Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble may seem simple enough. It’s 6 100% ceramic products with matching designs: a toothbrush holder, a tumbler, a soap dish, a lotion dispenser, a tissue box, and a trash bin. None of these things require much explanation. What does deserve some attention, though, is the multi-stage process that one goes through when deciding to buy one or all of them. We’ve laid it out below:
Stage 1: Intrigue
These are interesting. The various pieces look stylish, and they all match. It might be nice to have a motif that really brings the entire bathroom together.
Stage 2: Skepticism
But do I really need any of these? The old coffee mug we put the toothbrushes in works just fine, as does the little wicker basket we’ve got for trash. The sink already has a built-in soap dish. This one would be easier to clean, but do you really need to clean something when all it does is hold soap? Isn’t soap itself essentially the concept of cleanliness made solid? Lotion bottles already come with a pump top and tissue boxes are their own tissue dispensers, really. Am I supposed to re-package things? Isn’t that adding unnecessary steps?
Stage 3: Re-evaluation
Yes, I guess technically it is adding unnecessary steps, but all in the service of style. And maybe that’s worth it. Which would maybe mean the steps aren’t unnecessary?
*Stage 4: Introspection
And what does it say about me that I’m so put off by these objectively simple tasks? Like, it isn’t hard to empty some lotion from one thing into another thing. It isn’t hard to put a box of tissues inside another box. Or clean a soap dish. Just like it isn’t hard to put a new bag in the garbage after I take the trash out. But I never do, not right away at least. I always wait hours, sometimes even a whole day, leaving paper towels and granola bar wrappers on the kitchen counter, until finally my desire for a clean surface outweighs my laziness. At which point I put a new bag in the garbage can and am reminded that the laziness was all to avoid something that takes mere seconds. And yet, when next I need to take out the trash, this process will repeat. Making matters worse: someday it might not just be taking out the trash. Someday it might be dirty diapers I’m dealing with. It might be taking kids to the doctor. It might taking the medication I need to stay alive. And when that time comes will I just attempt to put it off? I want to say no, that I’ll be past all of this by then, that I’ll finally be a responsible organized adult… but an I’m adult now, damnit! I should already be better than this!
Stage 5: Ascension
That’s it! No more! I’m going to buy every item in this Coquelicots Ceramic Bath Ensemble, not just because it’s stylish and will tie my bathroom together nicely! No, that’s all secondary. Really, I’m doing it to prove to everyone–but especially myself–that I’m capable of taking the right steps and building good habits! New me, here we come!
Stage 6: Regression
Purchase made! Now, it’s time for bed. Shit, wait? It’s trash day tomorrow, isn’t it? I should take the bin to the curb. Although, there really are only a couple bags in there. I’m sure I’d be fine until next week…"	0.07			2018-09-01T04:00:01.758Z	0.3734081588603498	0.94	49783

There’s an old saying about innovation: “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.” It is derived from an Emerson quote that reads: “If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.” In this way, the saying is an example of itself; the ‘mousetrap’ variant is shorter, snappier, and conveys the exact same meaning, thus it is the one most often used.
The implication here is basically if you build it, they will come: you’ll have lines around the block, people from all over frantically waving their bills in the air demanding the latest in mouse-entrapment technology.
The truth, we know now, is a bit different.
The world, upon beating a path to your door, would say, “This mousetrap is smaller and more humane than the previous mousetrap, but now I’ve decided I want a mousetrap that is smaller and more humane.” Or, “I have no mice in my house, but many spiders, and this mousetrap did not catch a single spider, which is a bit of a disappointment.” Or, “Excuse me, I have some ideas for how you might make this better mousetrap–which is a good start–into an even greater mousetrap, despite the fact that I have never myself built any mousetrap.”
And so it goes with the Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Pack. You can put it in the microwave if you need heat, or you can put in the freezer if you want it to be cold. The ceramic beads heat and cool with the gel, providing a nice texture, which one Amazon reviewer says, “makes for an easy massage.” But the title of that review–“slightly different than the norm”–is telling. It implies that the incorporation of a heretofore never used component is something slight. Innovation, people seem to believe, requires a total redo.
Yes, some reviews expressed issues with durability. That’s understandable to call out. A few wished it would be more pliable when frozen. Again, fair.
But then there are the other “complaints.”
One says: “The only drawback I’ve seen so far to this item is its size. For the most part, I don’t think the size will be an issue because it’s probably rare to treat an area larger than 6x10”.""
Just so we’re clear: the only issue this reviewer could foresee would arise in a scenario that they couldn’t foresee arising.
Another–in a review titled “Does the job but not much better than competition”–claims: “the problem is just like every other reusable gel back I’ve ever used: they simply don’t remain truly hot or cold enough for long enough to do a good job. They’re more warm or cool than they are hot or cold for much longer.”
To put it differently: the biggest problem with this product, in this reviewer’s experience, is endemic to this entire product category, not just this product, and relies upon a universal tolerance of hot and cold temperatures.
The point of all this is to show that people will always find things to gripe about. And maybe they’re right. Still, it seems like the best case scenario is that you really love the texture of the ceramic beads inside the gel, and the worst case scenario is that you get three of totally passable hot/cold packs for $18.

Here we go again! The return of The Skeptics Choice, our occasional write-up segment wherein we read what a product claims to do and say, “hmm… I don’t know…” Today, we’re talking about a PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser. Follow along, won’t you?
The Claim
For all those who are thinking that we’ve been through this all before, fear not: this is a different kind of diffuser than the one we sold last time. This one is a “one-of-a-kind product combines the therapeutic properties of a pure Himalayan salt rock lamp with the soothing aromatherapy of an essential oil diffuser.” Apparently, it sets “the perfect mood for relaxation at home” and provides “all the benefits you would expect from this powerful combo.”
The Skepticism
That last part is a little presumptuous. All the benefits I would expect? I understand each word in the phrase “Himalayan Salt Lamp” on its own, but I know nothing about what they mean when they’re put together. But that’s no bother! It’s all laid out right there in the marketing copy:


The first benefit is that it will “help boost your mood.” And honestly, that sounds legit! When you’ve had your windows shut for almost 12 consecutive months because it took just a single day for the seasons transition from the bitter cold of winter to the brutal humidity of summer, something that makes the air smell pretty can be a nice little pick-me-up.


The second benefit is that it can “increase energy levels.” This seems a little more like bullshit than the first claim, but it’s vague enough that I’m willing to give it a pass.


The third benefit is that it will “neutralize the positively charged ions that emit from electronic devices like smartphones, televisions, radios, and more.”


Umm, what the fuck? That sure escalated quickly.
Seriously, the difference in hysteria levels from “it might boost your mood” to “it’ll protect you from killer ions” is about equal to the difference between a “hang in there, kitty” poster and one of those spam posts from MySpace that was like, “Post this on 10 of your friends’ profiles or else your eyes will fall out.”
And by the way, I’m not against a lot of this stuff. Crystals are fine. Astrology is fine. You could argue that it’s unscientific, but that’s missing the point. Life sucks sometimes. If getting some stones to put in your pocket makes you feel less like you’re flying a cloud of chaos towards an inevitably disappointing conclusion, more power to you! I watch groups of men in polyester play what is basically an IRL-board game involving sticks and balls on an enormous grass-and-dirt field, and if the group of men I like outplays the group of men I don’t like, I feel profound happiness. So, I try not to judge people for the things they use to pass the time.
But I will ABSOLUTELY judge anyone who preys upon someone based on those things. Because that’s what they’re doing here. They’re not saying: “you like this thing? we make this thing~” They’re saying, “we make this thing! it is DANGEROUS not to have this thing!!!” In other words, it’s taking something that should be a distraction from the chaos of daily life–which it totally could be, by the way: it’s cool looking; it lights up; it smells nice–and turning it into part of the chaos of daily life. And that’s messed up.
(Also, sorta tangential but still relevant, it’s problematic in a whole other way: What’s dangerous about technology is not that it’s pumping the air full of ions; it’s how intrusive it is. For example, did you know that if you say “Bloody Mary” three times into your smart phone, an ad for “great local brunch spots” will appear on your Facebook timeline? Our devices are definitely listening to us. We can all agree on that, right? Fine, maybe I’m just being paranoid. But you have to know that every Google search, every purchase, every photo you post is being mined for important data. And so making it a conversation about “ions” is pushing it in a direction that helps no one but those selling PureGlow Crystal 2-in-1 Himalayan Salt Lamp & Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffusers.)
The Conclusion
If you want a thing that lights up and looks cool and smells nice, this is a good investment. If you’re thinking about buying this because you’re afraid to breath in all the electro-turds you released into the air while binging Sharp Objects, maybe open a window?"	0.05			2018-08-30T04:00:02.770Z	0.20794343938448737	0.93	60935

I’m a lawyer, but right now, I’m not in the courtroom. Instead, it’s late at night and I’m in my office, wearing Ray-Ban glasses, poring over all the evidence of this grueling case, trying to find something to prove my client is innocent. All the older lawyers at this firm didn’t want to take my client on, and I’m starting to see why, but then again, I’m a young perky go-getter. Sometimes I worry that I’m too concerned with upholding justice, that I get too wrapped up in what’s right and wrong, that I fall in love with too many of my clients. But I can’t think about that now. I need to squint through my Ray-Bans at this piece of paper, then dig out another piece of paper and squint at that one, before realizing I’ve found it: a small but pretty obvious detail that proves my client wasn’t there that night. Thanks, Ray-Bans! I couldn’t have done it without you.

I’m a bit of a nerd. You can tell because I’m always wearing these thick Ray-Ban frames. Also, I’m always doing nerdy things like taking notes in class or carrying a lot of books. Sometimes I drop them, to the delight of cheerleaders and jocks. My best friend is quirky and outgoing, but I am not. I have a figure that would require a nutritionist and hours of gym time each day to maintain, but you can’t see it under these bulky sweaters that I wear, while sitting in my bedroom listening to non-aggressive indie rock or reading an obscure book like Wuthering Heights or The Collected Plays of William Shakespeare. Perhaps someday, someone will move here from out of town and crack this high school’s social hierarchy wide open, but until then it’s just me, my one quirky friend, my books, my sweaters, and my Ray-Ban glasses.

3.

I’m what you might call a savant. I’m always doing things like solving unsolvable math equations, or going to the park and playing five games of chess at a time… and winning. The crisp lines of my Ray-Ban frames are definitely in stark contrast with my wildly disheveled hair! Can I tell you something? I wasn’t surprised to see the government suits show up at my house. What did surprise me was when they took me to the research facility and showed me what they found. I stared at it for a whole a minute. Then I dramatically took off my Ray-Ban glasses, wiped them on my shirt, and stared at it for a minute longer. I didn’t know what I was looking at. What I did know was that, despite being just a guy from Queens (with the IQ of a Nobel laureate), I might save the world. Strap in, Ray-Bans! This is going to be a long ride!

Dearest Meh Customers,
Apparently, our minds cannot be trusted, and for that we are sorry.
You see, in our previous attempt to sell these M Cushions, we misinterpreted a few things. By which we mean, we mistook several vague comments about the massager being applied to unnamed areas beyond the back to mean…
Hmmm…
How do we say it exactly?
Let’s try this: we thought you were implying that the M Cushion could be applied to places where the combination of friction and heat might bring about sensations not unrelated to relief, but a step beyond relief, a sort of deep relief that goes by many names, one of which it shares with a term from film and literature meaning the culmination of the story’s drama.
But, um… apparently we were a little off-base. As one quoted commenter noted:

I swear I didn’t mean it in a sexual way. I just meant after leg day you can lean back in bed and use it on your aching thighs rather comfortably.

So, we apologize to you, commenters who we misunderstood. And moreover, we apologize also to all out there who purchased the M Cushion hoping for that aforementioned special sense of relief and, instead, received what seems to be a pretty good, if not aggressive, massage pillow and little else.
Thus, we promise not to make the same mistake again. We will heretofore not only market the M Cushion 18"" Heated Shiatsu Massage Pillow in a straightforward manner; we also vow never to purposefully misinterpret anything said on our forums as sexual innuendo… unless it’s, like, really funny to do so.

Time to dive into our library of branded content romance novels, for a tale of secrecy, royalty, and grilling. Please enjoy these excerpts from Coals Aflame by Criminy Highlater.

Grilling with one tool? Mary had gotten used to that thanks to her Starfrit Tonglite. In many ways, she was a lot like the 6-in-1 bbq multi-tool: she was strong, she had many skills, could do many things, and, since Eric had run off with his secretary a year before, she relied only on herself.
Which was what she planned to do that Saturday afternoon. Her work at the non-profit, helping troubled youth gain acceptance to Ivy League schools, didn’t leave her much time for making friends, so she would do it on her own. She would take a cooler, her little grill, and her Starfrit, and she would go from her apartment in Soho to Central Park to have a little cookout for one. It would be simple… or so she thought.
“M’lady, if I may have a word,” came a voice soon after she’d set up. Mary ignored it, thinking it sounded so British and refined that it must be coming from someone’s radio. But when it persisted, she looked up.
An austere and very handsome man stood in front of her.
“There you are,” he said. “I couldn’t help but gain sight of your grill, and I wondered if I might bequeath you of a favor?”
Mary had gotten good at doing things alone since Eric left, but there was something interesting about this man, something that made her desire his company.

The man said his name was Collin, and he worked for the a mysterious member of the royal family, Prince Nigel. Mary remembered seeing on the news that Nigel was making his first visit to the United States. She hadn’t listened to the story, because she’d been distracted by the strange mask the prince seemed to wear everywhere.
“What kind of work do you do for him?” Mary asked.
“All sorts,” was all Collin said.
“And so what can I help you with?” Mary asked.
“Well, being among the prince’s central envoy, I am privy to many of the finest restaurants in the world, but I don’t always want to partake in such luxury. And I was hoping you might allow me to dine with you, to take in a true American meal!”
“That’s it?” Mary asked. “You want a burger and some hot dogs?”
“'Tis my heart’s desire,” Collin said with a winning smile. “And if it would please you, I’d be happy to help. For example, perhaps I will unpack the remainder of the tools you require for grilling?”
Mary smiled and held up the Starfrit. “I only need one!”

Mary flipped burgers with the spatula when the upper arm was drawn back and rotated hot dogs with the tongs when the upper arm was extended. She opened them each a bottle of beer with the opener. “A fine colonial ale!” Collin said. Mary laughed, using the Starfrit’s serrated edge to cut the buns.
While they ate, Mary asked, “So is Prince Nigel really as eccentric as he seems?”
“You’re asking about the mask, I presume?”
Mary blushed. ""Well, I–
Collin laughed. “It’s no issue. It’s what everyone wants to know: why is he always wearing that strange masquerade mask, the one behind which he has hidden since his youth? Is his face disfigured? Is he some sort of lunatic? But the truth is, he simply desires privacy. He doesn’t want to be followed everywhere he goes.”
Mary opened her mouth, ready to say that this made sense–that she could not imagine what it must be like–when suddenly the sky went dark.
Nearby people screamed. Collin grabbed her hand, fearfully. “My god, it’s some sort of unpredicted total solar eclipse! Not even my royal astronomer saw this coming!”
Mary switched on the Starfrit’s flashlight, which she usually only used for convenient nighttime cooking.
“What do you mean ‘your’ royal astronomer?” She asked. She pointed the flashlight towards him, then towards his arm, and down to wear his hand still held hers. She felt a rush of something she had not felt in some time, not since Eric.
But then, the sun came back. Mary turned the light off and set the Starfrit down. Collin quickly stood. “I’ve just realized something, something very important,” he said. “Blast, I have so much bloody work. I must be retreating, but perhaps we could meet later? For another ale?”
Mary nodded. Collin named a bar–a dingy sports bar on the East Side–and a time. With that, he was gone. When Mary went to pack up, she couldn’t find her Starfrit anywhere. Which was a shame, as its scraper feature certainly would’ve helped her to clean her grill.

Mary waited at the bar, nursing her beer. The televisions were all turned to the baseball game, with the sound way up. Occasionally, a promo for the evening news promised coverage of Prince Nigel’s visit as well as the strange lunar happening of the afternoon.
“Who cares,” Mary mumbled to herself. Collin was late. Of course he was! He probably wasn’t coming. Another near-miss with love, she thought.
Just then, the feed cut out from the baseball game. “We interrupt this broadcast to bring you, a statement from Prince Nigel the Third.”
There he stood, the man in the strange mask. Mary laughed. He looked so silly. Then he spoke.
“Good morrow, our friends from across the pond,” he said.
Mary felt herself go rigid. She recognized that voice! But no, it couldn’t be. Could it?
“Collin?” she said, as if he could answer her through the television.
“It has been lovely visiting your many museums and areas of historical importance,” the prince went on. “But it was none of them that taught me the most. It was a single person–a single woman–who showed me the true American character, one that is not afraid of multiplicity.” He held up the Starfrit; Mary’s breath caught. “I’ve learned that, like this tool, Americans can do great things, many different great things, and are not as easily categorizable as they seem. And like this tool, they can do wonders at a grill.”
The crowd broke out in laughter in applause. Cameras flashed.
“Now, I may have more to say on this later. But right now, I must be going. I need to return this to its rightful owner. I fear I may even be late!” Just as quickly as the address had begun, it was over. The baseball game returned.
“Anyone sitting here?” a woman said to Mary, indicating the seat next to her at a bar.
Mary smiled. “Yes,” she said. “Or I should say, he’s on his way here now.”"	0.07			2018-08-25T04:00:01.567Z	0.3806925754768836	0.9	53347	0.020357891736731745

When you see an 8-piece cookware set like this–which is really a 4-piece cookware set with a lid for each item–there’s likely an image that comes to mind.
You see yourself standing at the stove, each of the four burners occupied by one of the pots or pans. Perhaps a sauce simmers in one and water comes to a boil in another for pasta that you rolled yourself. You’re sautéing some garlic and onions in yet another, and not with a spatula; instead, with just a flick of your wrist you are cycling it through the air like they do in cooking shows. In the final pan, you brown your steaks before moving them to the oven, where they will cook to a perfect medium rare.
But this image is a fantasy. You can’t actually manage cooking four precise things at once. Honestly, if your stove had only one or two burners, it would work just fine. It might free up some counter space for dealing with the onions you forgot to mince until after your butter had already melted (and burned) in the frying pan.
Thus, purchasing four pots and pans all at once is not necessary, but it is aspirational. You need to keep the dream alive, of wowing your friends and family members with perfectly balanced 4-part meals that make use of descriptors like “deconstructed” or “molecular” or “done three ways.” To have only one pan or one pot would be to admit defeat, to shut the door on your glorious dreams.
In the meantime, great news: you can make your signature “pasta a la butter and a handful of shredded cheese” in one of these just fine!

Dearest Anthony,
It is with a heavy heart that I compose this letter. When you return from your stint with the touring company, you will find me gone, and while we will always be brothers, I will no longer be welcome in our family’s house.
As you might suspect, father discovered my designs. He left for the park to perform his troupe. It was a production of Twelfth Knight, and while he had mentioned that it had been adapted for sock puppets, he made no indication that such modifications involved a shortening of runtime. Thus, I thought I would have nearly three hours of uninterrupted work time. When he arrived home just forty-five minutes later, he found me hard at work on my makeshift drawing table.
Now, I know what you are thinking: why did I not simply lie? You instructed me to do just that when I first confided in you about the designs. But Anthony, I have been lying all my life. I attended L’Academie Royale De L’Art Textile to study sock puppeteering at the age of fifteen. The instructors told me I could emote more with my wrists and palms than most classically trained thespians could with the whole of their bodies. I graduated at the top of my class and received invitations from several of the most renowned touring companies. I traveled the globe. By the age of seventeen, I had performed for two kings and six queens. But it was never what I wanted. I didn’t want to be a sock puppeteer like father and like all of our uncles, like grandfather before them, like you.
And I told father so. When he found me at my drawing table and asked what it was I was scribbling, I confessed everything: that the pretense under which I had returned home–to found my own sock puppet theater–was untrue; that I wanted no longer to act with socks but make my own socks, socks that, in their design alone, possessed as much vibrant life as could be instilled by a skilled sock puppeteer.
Father did not appreciate this, of course. He scoffed at my plans. He told me that out there, beyond the cardboard walls of a sock puppet theater, socks were not lauded but ridiculed. He said there was no such thing as a vibrant life-affirming sock out there. He said they were simple and drab, a mere treaty between foot and shoe.
Moreover, he said I have two options: I must either cast my designs into the fireplace and resume my pursuit of sock puppetry, or forever be banished from his house. As the opening this letter has surely confirmed, I have chosen the latter. I will be traveling far away from here, all the way to the Americas.
So, fare thee well, brother. While it is unlikely that our paths will cross again, perhaps someday you will be in clothing store and you will see a brand of exciting colorful socks with my name upon them and know I have lived my dream.
Yours,
Ezekiel"	0.05			2018-08-22T04:00:07.337Z	0.3287164649283502	0.94	61717			0.03937749319454194	0.07019466178157474

What we’ve got here are some little mystery grab-bags containing cute-ified versions of your favorite (or least favorite) WWE wrestlers. As with each of these Order/Hoarder sales, we like to provide a little math breakdown: for $5, you can get 8 packs of them, which comes out to 63 cents each. On the other hand, you could get 64 packs for just $20. That’s 31 cents each, right? WRONG! Since you can only order 8 or 64, the first 8 cost $5, and the last 56 cost $15, which means those last 56 are costing you just about 27 cents each! That’s one quarter and two pennies! And when you consider that each pack contains 2… that’s less than 14 cents per wrestler!
And if you’re like, “why would I need 128 of these things?” here are a few helpful suggestions:


Put a bowl of them at the end of your desk at work, and if anyone asks you why, just say, in as condescending a voice as possible: “It’s healthier to hold a tiny wrestler than it is to eat candy.”


Give them away at your kids’ parties. Do you kids and their like wrestlers? Great! They’ll love these things. Do they not like wrestlers? That’s okay too. They won’t know who any of these people are and you can just call them L’il Fun Buddies or something.


Isn’t it about time your little Christmas village got some extreme new residents?


Glue them to your dashboard and let them intimidate you into being a better driver.


Carry them around with you and conduct a social experiment called: how many random people on the street will catch a little wrestler when you say to them: hey you, catch this little wrestler?


You do realize it’s only 71 days till Halloween, right?

At $49, this has got to be the most expensive backpack we’ve ever sold. And for that reason it’s not going to be for everyone.
And we don’t just mean if you’re not into GoPro stuff. Because, yes: it has a Go-Pro mount, as well as a padded crushproof compartment to hold 3 GoPros and a bunch of GoPro related gear. But even if you’re not into capturing your various thrill-seeking adventures on video, there’s still plenty of use here. It’s sturdy, lightweight, and features a variety of useful compartments, such as built-in fanny-pack pockets on the waist-belt in which you can stash your phone or anything else you need close at hand.
But yeah: if you just need a backpack that does only what its name implies–a pack to put on your back–then you probably don’t want to spend $49. Not even for one that has mostly 5-star reviews (and nothing lower than a 4) on Amazon…
On Amazon. On… Amazon…
Why does that seem relevant?
Oh, we know: it’s because, while we’re selling it for $49, it actually retails for just north of $100 over there. And so all these people who are saying “Awesome bag” or “I LOVE THIS PACK” or “Bag is amazing” or simply “Perfect”–they’re happy to have spent three-figures on these thing!
They could’ve put that money towards two week’s worth of groceries or a few gas tank’s worth of gas or a few months of internet or a vending machine snack every Monday through Friday for a third of the year, but instead they spent it on a bag. And not only did they not regret it; they LOVED it.
Our point is: it must be a pretty good bag. Our other point is: at least we’re selling it for half as cheap as elsewhere."	0.05			2018-08-20T04:00:03.040Z	0.345231304974333	0.92	70757

Let’s just get right to the basic question here: what is so damn smart about these Smart Stands?
“Smart” has come to be synonymous with “online” or “connected to wifi.” But these Smart Stands are neither. They are an amalgamation of plastic and hinge. There is no voice control or app so you can manage it while you’re on vacation or built-in analytics to tell you how you might best use it in the future, based on your past trends. They just sit there and holds up your tablet or phone.
And maybe in that way they’re the smartest of “smart” products: because they’re smart enough to know what they do well, and also to know what they don’t need to do.
The past is a veritable web of failed innovations. Just like no one wanted pasta from Panera or personal pizzas from Subway, nobody’s pining for some bullshit half-functional beta-level technology to do something that was already extremely simple. Being “smart” is not just creating new complicated functions to prove you can; it’s pausing before you do all the work and asking, “Wait, why are we doing this? Is this actually necessary?”
But you know who didn’t skip that step? Smart Stands. They asked, “Why?” And they said, “Because sometimes you want your tablet to be up like this rather than down like that.” And then they asked, “Should we go further?” And they decided: “No, because the further we go, the more we risk losing our greatest asset, which is that our stands are universally compatible with all phones and tablets.”
See, sometimes intelligence is knowing when to stop and say, “Good enough for me.” Which is why these smart stands are good enough for you, no matter what kind of device you prefer."	0.07			2018-08-19T04:00:02.021Z	0.46941764127665553	0.94	53660			0.024072699552649

Yes, we mentioned the blender bottles sale from a couple Saturdays ago in yesterday’s write-up, but we were mostly talking about the bottles themselves. Today, we’d like to talk about the sale.
See, that sale was an experiment. We offered two choices: a rational number of bottles (the 4-pack) for a good price; or an irrational number of bottles (the 16-pack) for an even better price, with no middle ground. We wanted to know, could we bait you into making a totally ridiculous purchase just by making you feel like you’d gotten a ‘great deal’?
The answer, in a fair number of cases, was ‘yes!’ And so here we are again.
Now, before we get to the product, we need to name this as-of-today recurring sale type. Some ideas:
The Excess Express: Because like an express train, there are few stops between where you should go and the end of the line!
DTB: Does it stand for “Down to buy”? Nope! It’s “Direct to Basement.” Because you don’t need to pretend you’re actually going to use all this stuff! Take one out, deposit the rest downstairs with all the other stuff you thought was a good investment!
Any or Many: Pretty self-explanatory. Other option, along these lines: “More or Less.” Other other option, along these lines: “Deal or Mo’ Deal.”
Irrational Numbers: Are these deals really that much like the mathematical concept of irrational numbers? Yes–because the logic of either is hard to explain–but also no–because only one of them will make you feel smart.
(Also, hello nerds, who are right now gearing up to compose some long screed in the comments about how, well, actually, it’s not that difficult at all to explain irrational numbers!)
Anyway, you can vote on those on today’s poll (and give your own suggestions). Who knows! Maybe if this works, we’ll have a whole spin-off site where do only this kind of deal! Eh?!
As for today’s product, here’s some info: they’re power banks, so it’s not exactly as impractical to have a bunch of them as it was with the blender bottles. Also, we sold something that looks like these before, with the shoe sole pattern, but these are the 6000mAh version, whereas last time they were 9000mAh. On the plus side: that means they’re smaller. On the downside: that means they have less charging capacity (each one can carry enough power to charge the average phone about 3 full times, rather than 4 with the other version).
But really, what’s important is THE DEAL! Because think about: at 2 for $12, that’s $6 per power bank. Not a bad price at all. BUT if you opt for 10, and assume that the first 2 cost $6 each, that means the last 8 cost just $24, or a mere $3 each! And if you go deeper and consider that each of those 8 is rated at 6,000 milliamp hours, that means that you’re only paying $0.0005 per mAh! And $0.0005 is basically nothing, and a lot of nothing is still nothing, therefore, WE’RE PRETTY MUCH GIVING THESE THINGS AWAY!
Okay, maybe we kind of flubbed up the logic there. But the question remains: do you want a boring old 2-pack of Xsories 6000mAh Power Banks for $12 or an amazing 10 for $36?!"	0.07			2018-08-18T04:00:05.333Z	0.3572084668612603	0.93	53049			0.024494294870486415

You probably saw the word “blender” and the word “bottle” and thought, why do I need this thing when I just received my 4 or 16 pack of blender bottles? But the products are actually very different. For example, the blender bottles we sold before were both blenders and bottles, whereas this is a blender that comes with two vessels for blending that are themselves bottles.
Or, to put it differently:
The blender bottles are bottles that can blend things inside the bottle, whereas this is a blender that blend things inside one of the two bottles that come with it (or more than two, if you order more than one blender, in which case, you simply need to multiply the number of blenders you order by two to ascertain the number of bottles, which again, are not blender bottles, but bottles that work with this blender).
But here’s the thing: even if you ordered the blender bottles, you can still order this blender and bottles, because the blender and the blender bottles (not to be confused with the bottles that come with the blender) can be used together (although, obviously, the blender and the bottles it comes with can be used together too). See, blender bottles we sold a couple weeks ago, having only a small metal ball rather than a blade or a motor (like this blender has), aren’t really great at being blenders, but they are good at whisking things (so maybe they should be called ‘whisker bottles,’ although on second thought, maybe not, as that sounds like something altogether different and unappealing).
Point is, you could use the blender–this one, the one with a motor and a blade–for more intense blending jobs, like making a fruit smoothie. Then, you can pour the smoothie from the blender’s blending bottle into a blender bottle and take it with you wherever you’re going, so that you can whisk it back together if it settles.
What we’re saying is that what you should really do is buy this blender and two bottles and then pour the things you make in the blender’s bottles into one of your blender bottles, while using the bottles that come with the blender just for the initial blending.
Unless you didn’t buy the blender bottles. In which case, disregard the above."	0.05			2018-08-17T04:00:10.364Z	0.30912710887561573	0.94	60832

Well, this is a first from our branded content romance novel collection: a teenaged paranormal love story! Please enjoy these excerpts of The Heart Races Until It Rests by Annborny Hilledale.

Ellie met Henri while running.
She was not looking for love. When she’d quit the cheerleading squad to join cross-country, her boyfriend Brad, the quarterback of the school’s football team, dumped her because her running gear didn’t look “as hot.” She was relieved more than anything. She was a senior and she had decisions to make: did she want to go to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Oxford, or one of the other ivy league schools she’d gotten into?
Really, Ellie wanted to got to a small liberal arts school and study poetry, but it wasn’t up to her. Both her mother and her father were founders and CEOs of very powerful companies, and they’d both fought so much about whose company Ellie would eventually take over that they’d gotten a divorce. The only thing they could agree on anymore: Ellie had to study business.
Her Polar Heart Rate Monitor beeped helpfully to let her know her heart rate had risen above her optimal zone. Ellie often ran too fast when she got anxious about the future.
She slowed down, which was when the boy appeared at her side. ‘Appeared’ because Ellie hadn’t seen him approach. “Good day!” he said with a smile. He looked about her age but also–Ellie couldn’t exactly describe it–almost sepia-toned? He wore a strange antiquated cotton shirt and cotton shorts and his shoes appeared old-fashioned, with almost no support. “The name is Henri. I’ve just begun to undertake the task of what I’ve heard referred to as ‘cardiovascular activity’ and I was wondering if you might allow me to accompany you!”
Ellie looked at her Polar Heart Rate Monitor again. Its easy-to-read screen let her know that she’d reached her workout goal for the day. “Sorry. I’m actually just wrapping up.”
Henri looked at his shoes, disappointed. “I understand,” he said.
“But tomorrow,” Ellie heard herself say. She didn’t know why. There was something interesting about him. “I’ll pick you up at your house and we’ll go for a jog. Where do you live?”
“Just past 229 Healy Street.” Something seemed to occur to Henri. “But upon a secondary thought, t’wouldst it be possible to meet right here?”
Ellie agreed. The plan was set.

For all his grandstanding about not understanding ‘cardiovascular activity’ Henri never seemed to get tired. They talked the whole way about classic poetry. Henri was very familiar and spoke about the poets in a funny way. Like with his look, Ellie couldn’t exactly place the strangeness of his tone except to say it seemed that he often spoke as if he knew the poets personally. She chalked it up to an affect, of which Henri had plenty!
“What is that strange jewelry you wear?” he asked at one point.
“This? It’s my Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Its convenient display makes it easy to track my total calories burned per session as well as provide a weekly training summary.”
“Is it expressly designed for this very activity?”
“Nope! It’s great for biking, circuit training, or even just walking. Here do you want to try it on?”
“Oh, that’s not necessary–” Henri started to say, but Ellie had already stopped and slipped it off her wrist. Had this all been a ploy to take his exceedingly pale wrist into her hand? Did she have a growing desire to touch him? Perhaps, but Henri seemed uncomfortable, and they ran the rest of the way in silence.
Later, when she uploaded the data easily to her free profile at polarpersonaltrainer.com by way of her Polar Flowlink, she noticed something odd. The data for her run was there, but around the time she put the watch on Henri, all heart rate readings went blank.
“Huh,” she said. “Must be an issue with the monitor.” But her Polar Heart Rate Monitor had always worked flawlessly before…

It kept happening. Each day, the Polar would continuously display her own heart rate, and when Henri would wear it for the second half of their run–something Ellie insisted on, as a means of testing its functionality–there would be no reading.
But she didn’t know how to tell him something was wrong. Just as they managed to remain in the optimal zone for burning fat thanks to the Heart Rate Monitor, so too did it feel as if they were always in the optimal zone for conversation. She could tell Henri anything and he seemed to understand: about her parents, about her college decision, or about her day at school (from which he was conspicuously absent).
Finally, one day she couldn’t help it.
“Henri,” she said. “I need to tell you something. I’m in love with you.”
“And I need to tell you something,” Henri said. “Ellie, I’m a ghost. The ghost of Henri Olson, a long forgotten poet who died in his teens.”
Ellie should’ve been surprised, but somehow she wasn’t. “So that’s why your heart rate never showed up.”
“Alas!” he cried. “But if it could, it would read a number so high, as just the sight of you sets me aflutter! You see, I have unfinished business, Ellie. I have never felt love.”
“Never?”
“You must understand: it was a different time when I was born. We weren’t worried about heart rates. If we could have such a glorious device as that Polar when I was growing up, it would not measure calories but risk of scarlet fever. In such a dangerous time, can one ever feel true love? I say no, despite writing so many poems about it. But with you Ellie, well I’ve been trying to deny it. To admit so much would be to finish my unfinished business…”
“Just kiss me,” Ellie said. She leaned forward with her eyes closed and their lips met. She tasted no salty sweat on his lips, despite that the Polar Heart Rate Monitor said they’d really been pushing themselves. But of course she wouldn’t. Ghosts didn’t sweat, not even beautiful ones.
In the moment before she could open her eyes, Henri whispered: “Ellie, I love you.”
Ellie found herself alone on the road.

The dean of the English department at the small idyllic Halpern College ushered Ellie into his office. She didn’t wear her Polar Heart Rate Monitor because she was afraid her rapid nervous heartbeat would set off an alarm.
“It’s quite unusual,” the dean said, “for a freshman to win our annual award for gothic poetry, but the imagery you’ve presented–of the final kiss, of riding your bike past his supposed address and finding a graveyard, all of it–it’s just so lovely. Such a wonderful imagination.”
“You could call it that,” Ellie said.
“So I’m pleased to say, as your reward, we will purchase any book for the library in your name. Now, don’t be afraid to take some time to think it over–”
“The Collected Works of Henri Olson.”
The dean cocked his head to the side. “I don’t think I’ve heard of him?”
“He died very young,” Ellie said, pretending to rub her eye to wipe away a tear. “But he–I mean, his poems–they were really quite lovely.”"	0.05			2018-08-16T04:00:03.517Z	0.23418002803322968	0.94	61944

Friends, before reading further, lock your doors, turn on all of the lights, and gather your pets and loved ones tight, because the following is a horror story.
We begin with a young man. Let us give him a name. Let us call him Sean.
This all happened some years ago, when Sean was just a naive young man who believed, due to being brought up in the Northeast within proximity to a certain corporate food chain, that donut shops could be relied upon for iced coffee. It was this misunderstanding that will ultimately lead to our story’s tragic end. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Sean, walking the streets of Seattle on a hot summer afternoon, entered a donut shop–not one of the fancy ones you may have heard of; a small, out-of-the-way place that will remain nameless–and asked the man behind the counter, “Do you have iced coffee?”
The man replied, “Yes, we have iced coffee.” Or no, that’s not it. That’s not it at all. What he said was: “Yes, I can do iced coffee.”
This should’ve been the tell, the sign that something was amiss and Sean should flee that donut shop. But he ignored the portents. He removed a small bill and said, “Great, I’ll have an iced coffee then.”
What happened next is almost too gruesome to put into words.
Almost.
The man behind the counter took a large styrofoam cup, filled it with ice, and proceeded to pour hot coffee from the pot directly over it, handing Sean, to his horror, a lukewarm watery mess.
But do not grieve for Sean. Do not shed one single tear over his ruined attempt to seek cold caffeination. For Sean is a complex protagonist, and he is not without blame here.
Because why was he even seeking to purchase an iced coffee in the first place? Why was he not buying beans in bulk and then using this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Bundle to make his own deliciously smooth and delightfully cheap iced coffee at home? Perhaps, if he had, the day before, loaded up the 1.6 qt. cold brew carafe–or the bottle, which he could’ve carried with him–he might have avoided such a cruel fate.
As is the case with many stories of terror and woe, this is a cautionary tale. Do not, dear reader, make the same mistake Sean made. Buy this bundle and live forever in cold coffee bliss."	0.05			2018-08-15T04:00:09.341Z	0.31881841989687204	0.93	65238

Children.

They were given a tube made of glass–the most satisfying of all smashables–filled with a weird, perhaps even delicious-looking, red substance.
Kids these days have it easy.
Or do they?
My mom, a nurse, always had a cupboard in the bathroom stocked with the most up-to-date medical paraphernalia. Therefore, we had a digital thermometer from the beginning. It was nice. Like this one, no mercury. Like this one, an easy straightforward digital readout of your temperature. Unlike this one, it took what felt like a half-hour to give a final verdict on whether or not you’d reached that magical realm north of 98.6 and earned the day off from school. And so, it wasn’t uncommon for the temperature-taker to put the thermometer in the child’s mouth and then walk away to take care of something else, allowing the child freedom to manipulate, through a variety of means, the final result.
This is hypothetical, of course. I would never have done such a thing.
(Oh, and also, just an FYI: that whole 98.6 being the average human temperature thing is the result of tests conducted by one doctor using a crummy armpit thermometer in the 19th century and is mostly bullshit.)

On day one, we sold a Roomba. That was in July, 2014. In the last 5 months of that year–our first 5 months of operation–we sold 5 more Roombas. We sold one or two in 2015. Since then, nothing. No more Roombas…
UNTIL TODAY!
What’s the best metaphor to capture the excitement of our reunification? Perhaps we could think of ourselves as a once famous rock band who amicably splintered to pursue our solo careers. We would certainly be the experimental-minded keyboardist, doing avant-guard work with help of speaker docks and vacuum sealers, whereas the Roomba would be the pop-forward frontman, producing hit after hit, each one more-or-less the same.
And now comes our glorious reunion tour!
(Although, now that I think about it, don’t bands usually reunite when the “well has run dry,” so to speak? As in: a last ditch effort to regain their former wealth or reputation?)
How about a different metaphor: in the 2015 we let the Roomba go off to clean, and now, after many years of service to the greater world, it’s made its circuitous way back to Meh, its noble charging port!
Nice pivot, eh?
Anyway, as we implied above, in the time since we last sold a Roomba, there have been, by our estimation, 6,000 new models released, all of which look almost exactly the same. So, if you’re wondering why you should buy this Roomba instead of a different Roomba, we are too.
But here’s what we gathered from these helpful breakdowns over at Vacuum Fanatics: the 805 is basically the base model of iRobot’s higher-end (though not highest end) 800 series of vacuum cleaners. It doesn’t have wi-fi like the 890, so it doesn’t work with Alexa or Google Assistant. Nor does it have the improved sensor capabilities of the 860. But it does have a lot of the other things that make those models great, such as a big bin and an AeroForce High Efficiency Filter, meaning the air that passes through it comes out a lot cleaner (which could be a big deal for allergy sufferers).

When the employees arrived at their first day at the new NOTILUS headquarters, they noticed something strange.
“There is no roof,” one of them said.
“Exactly,” said one of the higher-ups. “It’s an open-roof open-office.”
“But we won’t be protected from the rain,” said another employee.
“Exactly,” the higher-up said again.
The building had tile floors and was equipped with a siren. It sounded whenever a storm approached, at which point, the employees took the tarps provided to them and covered their computers, their phones, anything that could succumb to water damage. Then, they stood. They closed their eyes. They waited for the rain to wash over them so that they could understand it, become one with it.
Thus, when they engineered their shower heads to have 6 settings including “Wide Rainfall” and “Power Rain,” they knew these to be the true to their names. And when they built dual-zone antimicrobial jets that did not clog, it was not only to provide their customers with consistently strong water pressure; it was to mimic the rain that, year after year, never ceased to lessen in its strength.

The great philosopher Zaza Pachulia once said: “Nothing easy.” He was referring to the 8th seed Atlanta Hawks forcing a game seven against the 1st seed Boston Celtics, but his words are applicable to so many things in life. For us, there is “nothing easy” about balancing our standards for honest copy with our desire to offer a diverse range of products. Some days, it just seems untenable. And friends, today is one of those days. Because if I gave my 100% honest opinion of this ProCabello Straightener and Styler Kit it would be this:
IDK, it looks good to me, I guess.
See, I don’t actually know. I’ve never used a hair straightener, nor can I foresee a scenario arising in the future where I will either. Then again, this isn’t my first rodeo. There’ve been plenty of products I don’t particularly care about, and when they come up, there’s a simple solution: lean on the Amazon reviews.
Unfortunately this doesn’t help me much here, because the reviews, while positive (and that’s despite the significantly higher price point WITHOUT the “Shine and Hold Spray” we’re including), say very little.
For example, here is Diane Camargo’s review in full:

Love it!! The best flat iron I’ve used

And Karen Tucci writes:

Awesome flat iron. Heats up super fast. Has multiple heat settings. Very happy with my purchase.

And Adrian Blake Hammonds writes:

I love the way my hair feels.

Is it good to see such positive reviews of the item we’re selling? Sure. Do these reviews help me, as a copywriter, find an interesting angle for my write-up? No. Did I include three of them when one would suffice simply to push the write-up further down the page, thus making it appear longer? Of course. Unless it’s @Dave asking, in which case, no way! I did it for integrity!
Really the point is, it’s difficult to write about something without any personal attachment to even the concept of it. That’s why so much copy looks like… well… copy. But that’s not what we want. Likewise, we can’t just sell the stuff we know how to write about. We need to sell items that are outside of our comfort zone sometimes. Are they outside of the greater Meh community’s comfort zone, too? Maybe. Only time (and all of the graphs at the bottom of the page) will tell.

We’ve got another weird item pedaling vague impossible-to-prove pseudo-science, so that means another installment of THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE: a feature wherein we lay out the product’s claims and explain why we’re not so sure we believe them. Here goes!
The Claim
The Pure Daily Care Diffuser is the “ultimate starter pack for essential oil enthusiasts.” The various botanical oils are “100% pure” and also “100% organic” with “no fillers or additives.” All of this is fairly simple. Where it gets more interesting is in laying out the benefits of each included oil:

Peppermint is a “mental stimulant” that “provides energy”;
Orange is a “respiratory stimulator, antiseptic, antidepressant, aphrodisiac, and neural stimulator”;
Tea Tree is a “powerful immune stimulator”;
Lemongrass is “neural stimulator” that “soothes aches and pains while also reducing anxiety”;
Lavender is another “neural stimulator” that “reduces stress and anxiety and promotes restful sleep”;
and Eucalyptus is a “respiratory booster” and is “great for relieving sinus congestions.”

The Skepticism
Perhaps I shouldn’t call myself skeptical here. I’m not skeptical. I think this is bullshit, and moreover, I think it’s pretty dangerous. Not the diffuser itself, but the language.
Because eucalyptus oil will not relieve sinus congestion in a meaningful way. And lemongrass oil isn’t going to help with your sore joints. And orange oil is as much an antidepressant as the two day old styrofoam tub that held raw chicken in the trash is a depressant. By which I mean: walking into a house that smells bad sucks, and therefore will make you feel unhappy; so, conversely, walking into a house that smells good doesn’t suck, thus making you happy by contrast.
This is all to say that if you have sinus issues, or joint pain, or depression, don’t just buy a diffuser. See a doctor.
But again, this is an issue of language, specifically language that makes empty promises. The actual truth is essential oil diffusers are great. They don’t smell as fake and chemical-y as plug-ins. They’re not smokey like incense. It’s kinda cool to watch the mist rise out of them. And this one has 7 neat ambient light settings.
That’s why my wife and I are buying one: not for any medical reasons, but because we just moved into a new house and we want it to smell okay. Even when I forget to take out the trash…
In Conclusion
Diffusers are actually pretty nice, as long as what you’re looking for is a good smell, and not a cure."	0.05			2018-08-08T04:00:06.259Z	0.21768616353254416	0.94	62973

It’s been a while since we’ve been able to dip into our library of branded content romance novels, but luckily, we found one that just happens to involve today’s product. Get ready for a tale of desire and medical emergencies in these excerpts from Gene Harmony’s Love Is A Medicine Best Served At The Appropriate Temperature(s).

People were always asking Dale to open jars because of his amazingly strong arms. And people were also always asking why, when he could so easily be a model, he chose to work at the front desk of a pharmaceuticals lab. “Not everyone wants to be on the runway,” he’d say with a smile of clean white teeth that reinforced his model-like qualities. The real answer, though, was that he’d always had the desire to save lives. Working here, where so many important medications were developed, was the closest he could get.
Dale wasn’t the only one in the lab whose good looks were surprising. Rumor had it that Dr. Liza modeled to pay her way through graduate school on the way to becoming the world’s foremost expert on life-saving drugs. Whether that was true or not, Dale had to admit: she was beautiful. Even now, as she rushed up to the desk in her lab coat, clearly flustered, she looked exquisite.
Dale thought maybe she was coming to flirt, something that happened often, though nothing ever came of it. She was a lauded scientist, after all, and he a lowly receptionist. But flirting was not on the agenda today.
“Can I ask a big favor?” she said. “No one else is available to help and there’s a patient in need of an experimental medication. We have to get to the hospital, so it can be safely administered. Could you give me a ride?”
“No problem,” Dale said, standing.
“But there is a problem,” Dr. Liza said. “It’s a complicated medication, comprised of three very volatile liquids that cannot be combined until the last possible minute before being administered. Also, each substance must be kept within a certain temperature range. If I leave them in their test-tubes, they’ll grow too warm or too cold on the ride over.”
“I have just the thing,” Dale said.

Dale and Dr. Liza carried the four Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs out to his car: three filled with temperature controlled substances, one extra, “Just in case,” Dr. Liza had said.
“We need to be careful with these,” she said now, but it was not an issue at all, given that the Primulas’ contemporary attractive twist-textured design allowed for a secure grip. Not to mention they were splash-resistant! “And you’re sure they’re not contaminated?”
“Absolutely,” said Dale. “It’s very easy to clean the mugs themselves. And I put the lids through my dishwasher at home, on the top rack, where it’s safe for them to go.”
Dale could tell that Dr. Liza, though still nervous, was happy to hear this. And she was even happier when she saw that all four mugs fit into the various front- and back-seat cup-holders of Dale’s modest hatchback. “Like a glove,” she murmured to herself. “Maybe I’ll be okay after all.”
“What’s that?” Dale said.
But Dr. Liza didn’t repeat herself.

They’d left the lab an hour ago. The hospital was only five miles away. Yet, they found themselves only halfway there, stuck in unmoving bumper-to-bumper traffic. The reprieve in Dr. Liza’s anxiety, brought on by the various positive aspects of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs, proved temporary. Out of the corner of his eye, Dale had watched her grow more and more upset–first sitting straight up, then tapping her fingers on the dash and sighing loudly.
When she finally spoke, her voice cracked with fear. “It’s no use. We’re getting nowhere. We need to administer the medication now.”
“But how are we going to do that?” Dale said. “The patient is at the hospital.”
“No, I said we need to go to the hospital so they can administer it safely. The patient isn’t there. Not yet. She’s here. Dale, it’s me.”
“What?!”
“Look at me, Dale,” Dr. Liza said. “You’re going to have to administer the drug that’ll save my life from the disease I’ve kept a secret all these months.”
“But, but…”
“There are no buts about it,” Dr. Liza said. She pointed to one of the Primula 20oz Insulated Mugs. “See that Primula 20oz Insulated Mug? You told me that–with its double walls, vacuum seal, and triple-layer Copper Cold Technology–it can keep liquids hot for up to 8 hours and cool for 24. It makes sense that you’d have such a mug, because you’re a lot like it. You want to save lives. I’ve seen it in your eyes, and like a giant beautiful man-shaped Primula 20oz Insulated Mug, you keep that desire at the appropriate temperature so that it never dies.”
Dale nodded. She was right. He’d waited his whole life for this. Without a word, he got the empty Primula and carefully mixed the contents from the others together in it. “Now, what do I do?”
“It needs to be applied to my lips,” Dr. Liza said. “But first, it requires vermilion stabilization, meaning it must be applied to a healthy pair of lips, and then transferred from those lips to the taker’s.”
Dale understood what he must do. He gravely opened the easy-open, easy-close lid. It was straw-compatible but he didn’t need one now. He let the liquid touch his lips, and then he leaned over the center console to Dr. Liza…

Dale paced. He held a Primula 20oz Insulated Mug. He had cleaned it and filled it with coffee from the hospital waiting room two hours ago when he arrived, and it was still hot.
Finally, the doctor appeared. “She’s recovering,” he said, “thanks to that experimental drug she made and thanks to your administering of it. Still, to be safe, we’ll give her regular doses of it every four hours.”
“And how will you give it to her?” Dale said, feeling strangely jealous. “Do you have a machine for vermilion stabilization?”
The doctor looked at him, confused.
“You know,” Dale said. “It needs to be applied from healthy lips to the lips of the diseased.”
“It’s taken orally, son,” the doctor said. Then a sly grin came across his face. “If I had to wager a guess, I’d say someone has a crush on you!”"	0.05			2018-08-07T04:00:06.333Z	0.5387061168679262	0.92	64187			0.11531935223472428

“Do not cast your pearls before swine.”
People spoke these words without thinking, for a moment, of how they would hurt me, a pig. But more than speak them, they lived by them. Every time I walked into a jewelry store, they quickly rushed to put away their finest pearls.
I told them, “But it is me. I am not a descendent of some clown like Porky. My grandfather built the first ever wolf-proof house. He patented his  special structurally-sound brick-laying technique, and it has been used in the constructions of homes the country over, including three governors’ mansions. He passed his business down to my father who passed it down to me, and now, my net worth is somewhere in the high nine-figures. So please, allow me to purchase the great jewels of the sea.”
Still, I received nothing.
Then, one day, I saw a New Yorker cartoon. One dog sat on the floor, listening to another, seated at a computer.

The jewels look pretty much like a silver band from any further than a foot away, which is maybe a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preference.
They make a big deal about how they are designed for the minuscule ears of women, which I thought was just goofy marketing. But I’ll be honest, none of the 5 tip sizes really worked for my brutish masculine ears.
I was, however, able to get some tips from a previous pair onto them (with a little coaxing).
All-in-all, a very solid buy. If I didn’t already have 2 pairs, I’d buy some more as backup.

You get 2 pairs of Maroo ICE Headphones, but when you receive them, you might think you accidentally ordered 8. Because despite their “smaller fit for women’s ears,” these things come in an unnecessarily big and complicated box. User @Chakolate sums it up pretty nicely:

What is a problem is the amount of packaging. The unopened package is 223 grams, of which 11 grams are the actual headphones. They come in a jewelry-type velvet box, which is nestled in a lot of plastic, which is inside a thin cardboard box, which is wrapped in tissue paper. They also include a carry pouch, and a thick little book about how to use them. (Seriously? They’re kidding, right?) The end package is about 8x3x3"", which is absurd for headphones.

And in case you need some idea of how big that actually is, here’s a picture.

For context, the can next to it is 16 ounces. It’s also a delicious hazy New England style IPA as good as any I had back east from the best brewery in Des Moines! (In case anyone from Confluence is reading and wants to give me some swag.)
Now, you’re probably thinking: “All that stuff for some bedazzled earbuds? What a waste!” But you’re not looking at the big picture. All the various packaging materials are not simply for this product; they’re for a bunch of different things we’ve sold over the course of the last year. For example:


You can cut up the plastic casing and put them in your Ray Ban Eyeglasses when one of the lenses breaks.


You can use the jewelry case to hold your Diamond Encrusted Eternal Heart-Shaped Pearl earrings.


You can use the pouches for safe transport of your WWE TeenyMates.


And you can use the tissue paper when you move to wrap the little espresso cups you got to go along with your Nespresso Vertuo.


Because everyone buys every product we sell, right? That’s how this is supposed to work. We put up an item each day, and you, in turn, buy at least one of that item each day, but preferably two or three.
Wait… really? You only buy some things we sell?! So we can’t rely on every user buying every single product?!?!

Four Blender Bottles probably seems like plenty of Blender Bottles. You have your Blender Bottle, your backup Blender Bottle, a Blender Bottle to try weird stuff in, and a Blender Bottle to give away when your friend is like, “Oh, I should get a Blender Bottle like that.”
Sixteen Blender Bottles is probably too many Blender Bottles. Even if you’re very clumsy with your Blender Bottles, or very experimental, or have a lot of friends who want Blender Bottles, you’re still probably going to end up with a few leftover Blender Bottles.
So why should you get sixteen Blender Bottles?
Because it’s possible that this is the best ever deal on Blender Bottles. You’re probably thinking: sixteen Blender Bottles for $49? That’s about $3 per Blender Bottle. Not bad, right? But it gets even better, because really, if four Blender Bottles costs $20, that means you’re really getting twelve Blender Bottles at $29. So you’re looking at a cost of less than $2.50 per Blender Bottle after the initial four Blender Bottles.
(Which, side note, makes for a great conversation starter. The next time you have some friends over just point to the pile of Blender Bottles in the corner–and there will be a pile of them in the corner; you have sixteen of them, after all–and say, “See that Blender Bottle? That Blender Bottle only cost me $2.42.” Just, make sure you point to one of the last twelve Blender Bottles, not one of the first four Blender Bottles, because as we’ve established, those Blender Bottles cost more.)
With savings like that, can you really pass up buying sixteen Blender Bottles?
You can?

The FoodSaver conference room was tense. Nobody knew why the emergency meeting had been called except that it involved “a failure in marketing.”
Finally, Richard, the sixty year old exec who’d sent out the invite, arrived.
“Folks, we’ve got problems,” he said. “Our prized product, the Vacuum Sealing System, is being used for things other than saving food. Which is bad, because that’s our name. One thing they’re using it for is something called ‘Sous vide,’ which I believe is a religion, so we’ll want to be very careful there. But the other thing is–” Richard looked around, and spoke in a hushed tone–“they’re using it for marijuana.”
“They smoke through the machine?” asked Terry, age fifty-two.
“That’s what I thought at first,” Richard said. “But it turns out it’s more for storage and keeping it fresh. Anyway, there’s a whole bunch of people doing it. I found a message board where everyone was snap-chatting about it. The Red Edit.”
“It’s called Reddit,” said the intern, age twenty-one. “It’s the ‘trees’ subreddit.”
“Nope, that’s not it,” said Richard. “It’s definitely not about trees. Your generation wouldn’t understand because your Woodstocks were different. Anyway, we need to cash in on this, and we need to cash in on this NOW. We need a marketing campaign. Something to appeal to the youth.”
“But you just said my generation–”
“Quiet, intern. The adults are talking. Now, let’s spitball a little. What do we got?”
“What if,” said Tony, age fifty-eight, “we do one of those internet pictures and then make it go viral?”
“I like that,” Richard said. “That’s a good plan: a viral internet picture.”
“I’ve seen one particular internet picture,” said Harry, age fifty-eight, “where there’s a man pointing at a butterfly. The man will be labeled, and the butterfly will be labeled, but the man will be saying, ‘Is this a something-other-than-butterfly?’”
“Because it’s labeled as something else,” Richard said.
“No,” said Harry. “I should’ve mentioned that too. He doesn’t call it what it’s labeled, either. He calls it something else. I believe that’s part of the joke.”
“Okay, so,” said Terry, “we label the butterfly ‘FoodSaver’ and the man as ‘consumer’ and he’s asking: ‘Is this a thing for storing my reefer?’”
“Ganja,” said Tony. “Let’s say ‘ganja.’”
“Good catch,” said Richard. “We need to use relevant terms.”
“Also, underneath the question,” said Harry, “it should say, ‘Yes, and you can has it!’”
“That’s with the cat, right?” Richard said.
“No,” Terry said. “Cat says, ‘hang in there.’”
“Well, this has been very productive,” said Richard. “Good work, team. I’ll send this along to the design department. I’ll tell them to redraw the image in case there’s a copyright issue and to get us twelve potential samples by this afternoon.”
“You want the design department to make twelve images in a few hours?” asked the intern.
“Yes,” said Richard.
“But how?”
“They have computers,” Richard said. “It’s easy. And anyway, I don’t tell them how to do their jobs. Until I do. Now, intern, didn’t I put you on a special office sustainability project? I thought you kids love that stuff.”

But who? Yes, there are plenty of people out there who love jewelry, but these days the gift-giving season (at least in our experience) seems to be less about personal affects and more about technological advancement. You don’t get your mom earrings anymore; you get her a tablet. And you don’t get your grandmother a bracelet; you order her a Roku and help set up Netflix so she can watch her shows on an infinite loop without commercial interruption. So who are you buying this jewelry for?
You might not be able to think of anyone… and that’s exactly the point!
You’re forgetting somebody. Or maybe you’re not. Maybe you didn’t even realize Aunt Gilma was coming this year, after what happened at the Easter Parade. Or maybe you didn’t know Cousin Nick was bringing his girlfriend from college, or that he had a girlfriend at all, or that he was in college, and actually the more you think about it, the less you remember even having a cousin Nick. But that doesn’t matter. She’ll be there for the holidays, and come Christmas morning you don’t want her to have to sit awkwardly on the floor among the landscape of shredded wrapping paper with a big pile of nothing to bring home.
And jewelry is the perfect gift in this situation: a nice, attractive, inoffensive, break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option for that special someone in your life… that you totally spaced on.
In other words, it wouldn’t hurt to just have some around this time of year.

Yes, with each day there comes fewer hours of sunlight to warm things up. The numbers you saw on the right in the “low” column have begun their migration left, replacing the previously pleasant “high” temperatures. Thus, this Primula Cold Brew Coffee Maker and travel brewers might, you think, only be used a short time before they go into storage. Because brewing iced coffee in December is like the beverage equivalent of wearing shorts during a blizzard: something done, in states that experience a true winter, only by the extremest of die-hards and season deniers.
As one such person, I can confirm: we are a small, proud, devoted (if not somewhat delusional) group. But we also know a secret that few others seem to understand.
Before I get to that, though, let me clarify. The group I’m talking about is those who drink iced coffee year round. I claim not to know anything about the cold-legged shorts wearers. Although I do wear shorts in the winter months sometimes. For example, if I’m stuck inside and doing something active, like cooking or cleaning.
And this is exactly the secret I’m talking about: winter only happens outside!
Everywhere else, it remains warm enough to drink refreshing smooth cold brew. At home. At work. Even in the car. Actually, especially in the car, after you’ve given it some time to warm up, when it becomes basically a mobile sauna.
What’s funny is that this secret hides in plain sight. Think about it. Do you bake your salads in the winter? Do you pour a bottle of Coca Cola into the kettle and set it to boil? Do you say to the bartender, “I’ll have the IPA, but nuke it on high for 45 seconds”? Sure, a hot toddy, a nice soup, or a steaming mug of hot apple cider is nice. but even in February, these things aren’t as ubiquitous as a glass of cold water and a deli sandwich.
In other words, it’s totally easy to normal to drink cold brew coffee year round. The only tough part is when you walk from the warmth of your car to the warmth of your house or your office with your cold cup in hand.

Alexa can’t rake leaves, and she’s terrible with a leaf blower. Ditto for scraping the frost from your car’s windshield.
You can ask her to help bring the potted plants in from the porch, and she’ll refuse each time, regardless of how polite you are. As if she doesn’t understand SHE works for YOU!
Alexa can tell you the Bolivian city Oruro’s population. She can tell you who serves at its mayor, or what kind of climate it experiences. She can probably tell you its exact coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. But she has no fucking clue where you put your damn sweaters after you moved this past summer.

Sous vide cooking is fun. It’s weird. It’s a lot different than most basic cooking methods. And because of that, there are tricks you’re bound to pick up along the way, little ways to improve your food’s flavor, or methods that maybe make it just that much easier.
Still, you’re bound to have some blind spots. Cooking is like having a problem to solve, the problem of how to get all these ingredients into a cohesive “meal.” As such, everyone’s going to come at it from a different angle. And knowing how another person approaches something might help you figure out the best way for you to do things.

Dearest Martha,
I wish I could say that I miss you. Alas, to suffer only a heavy heart would be a great relief! The truth is much worse than that. I write this letter because I am in grave danger, and I fear that I will suffer not death, but something much worse: a living death of sorts.
Yes, “fear”: a word you likely never thought you would see your husband write. For eight months, I cohabited with wild gorillas. For eleven, I roamed with a pack of wolves. For three, I swam with electric eels. I was buried a whole year among the bulldog ants of Australia in an attempt to understand their tunnel structure. Never once, in any of those cases, did I feel even remotely afraid. But none of them compare to this.
Though it may void my contract with the research firm, I will give you the full details of my current assignment: I was sent to integrate myself into a community of EarPod wearers, so that I might discern once and for all what makes them such incredible assholes.
I have, for the last month, been living among them somewhere in the Bay Area in what I believe is an apartment, but also seems to be a concert venue and startup. The startup is focused on an app of some kind but no one here actually programs. They all work as “organic social marketing disruptors” though many also dabble, I’m told, in graphic design. They wear their EarPods always. And so do I.
This is what I mean by a living death, Martha. Since putting the EarPods in, I have begun to have thoughts that seem not to belong to me. At first it was just, PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT PLEASE DONT FALL OUT on a constant loop. But as I acclimated, I began to think things like It’s too bad the world isn’t as present as me, or My podcast is better than this one, or What idiot called these EarPods instead of Lil’ Listenies? The other day, I thought once again about them falling out, but this time, it was, If these EarPods fall out, what’s going to keep my head from floating away?

Unfortunately, I am not sure my exact address, so you will have to fly to San Francisco and look for posters for a show we are hosting, featuring a performance by an artist named Transl8. He does electro-folk, as well as politically-conscious trip-hop.
Also, please bring a pair of Rowkin Bluetooth Earbuds. Just as I needed to take measures in order to avoid the bends when I resurfaced after spending those weeks with the angler fish, so must I do the same now. And those Rowkins are stylish, wireless, and way less obnoxious than EarPods. They should return me to myself in no time.

Screenprint Sunday is back… or is it? Because we’re giving you an option this week: to logo or not to logo. That’s right, you can choose a 6-pack of fleece blankets with the Meh logo, or a 6-pack of fleece blankets with no logo at all.
So, on the one hand, this seems like a smart move for us. Not everyone wants a blanket printed with something, especially not a logo for a deal-a-day site. It can feel like you’re basically an advertisement.
On the other hand, it would be pretty insulting if you chose blank blankets over Meh-printed blankets. It’s the same price, so you’re basically saying, “I’d prefer not to be associated with you.”
On the other other hand, you’re saying you’d prefer not to associate with us every day you choose not to buy something.
On the other other other hand, maybe buying the blank blankets is more insulting, because you’re coming here, seeing what we’re selling, and saying, “We’re willing to take your blankets, but we don’t want to help you out with some free advertising.”
On the other other other other hand, you are paying us, which does help.
On the other other other other other hand, it’s not all about you. Or us. It’s also about what your friends and family members might want. Like, maybe they don’t prefer to use a blanket with a giant Meh logo on it.
On the other other other other other other hand, that leaves more blankets for you!
On the other other other other other other other hand, this is short term thinking. You might enjoy hoarding blankets now, but eventually the thrill will be gone, and you’ll be left with only blankets and no love. And besides, weren’t you just saying how lonely you were?
On the other other other other other other other other hand, no: it was not you who was lonely. It was me, the man with eight hands, six blankets, and no friends.
I hope this helps you decide which blankets to buy!"	0.07			2018-11-04T04:00:05.099Z	0.3967801951626992	0.94	56100

Think of your favorite Christmas mornings growing up: you woke up after barely sleeping, rushed to the tree, and tore open your presents. Then maybe came some reprieve–maybe you ate some pancakes and drank some hot cocoa–after which the real fun started: you spent the next several hours painstakingly assembling a tiny model from even tinier pieces so that it could sit atop your desk forevermore!
Okay, maybe that wasn’t exactly how it went. Probably, you played video games, or with some new action figures or dolls. Maybe you watched some movies on TV, maybe you ate more pancakes, drank some more cocoa, maybe you didn’t get out of your pajamas until four in the afternoon when it was time for Christmas dinner, and maybe you were ready for bed at seven, the calories and the sporadic sleep from the night before combining into a potent sleep aid.
And I wouldn’t blame you if that’s what you chose to do. Because those things are more enjoyable than building a model. But here’s something to think about: are they as satisfying?
Because there’s an important difference here. Yes, you might enjoy a candy bar more than taking a jog. Yes, you might enjoy bingeing ten seasons of some guilty-pleasure thriller on Netflix more than spending the afternoon preparing a five-course meal for your visiting relatives. And yes, you’re probably going to enjoy sitting around on the couch on Christmas overindulging in food, toys, and TV (or for adults: food, booze, and basketball) more than building the tiny model of the Eiffel Tower that you got in your stocking.
But you won’t be as satisfied.
Anyone who’s ever done anything requiring a modicum of will-power and ingenuity–even if only to solve a minor problem of their own making–knows that the accompanying frustration quickly gives way to a more lasting pride. Every deep breath you take all day will remind you of that jog. For weeks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment after making that meal. And while you might regret all of the pancakes and cocoa and movies and Christmas cookies well before December 26th, you will always be able to look at your model and think, with a smug sense of satisfaction, I did that.
And that is the greatest gift of all.
At least, after all the other, cooler gifts."	0.07			2018-11-03T04:00:03.903Z	0.34069812514025755	0.94	52882

Ah yes, another gummy purporting to have some vague healing properties. Sounds like the perfect starting point for a rousing round of…
THE SKEPTIC’S CHOICE
Here’s how it works: we give you the claim the product makes, explain why we’re more than a little dubious, and then in the end, we come to some conclusion (if ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ can be considered a conclusion). Let’s get started!
The Claim
CBD is “a natural constituent of hemp” that “has been shown to have positive health benefits.” But since it contains no THC, it won’t get you high. Thus, it supposedly can help treat stuff like pain and anxiety with less risk of endless philosophizing or nachos.
The Skepticism
Here are pretty much all of the things we can definitively say about CBD:

It is short for cannabidiol.

Did we get all that? Does anyone need anything repeated? In the back? Can you all hear me?
Okay, that’s a simplification. There’s more. For example, we also know that, like Hansel, this CBD shit is just so hot right now. According to a New York Times article by Alex Williams, Willie Nelson is launching a line of CBD-infused coffee beans (two of his favorite things in one cup, he says), Mandy Moore is toying with it to see if it helps relieve the pain of walking in heels, and Glamour magazine ran a story with the headline “I Replaced My Entire Beauty Routine With Only CBD Products.” I am linking it here as proof. I refuse to actually read it, which I consider an act of self-care.
But what does it actually… do? Gabe Kennedy a twentysomething CBD start-up founder offers this:

Comparing it to the feeling after an intense meditation or yoga session, Mr. Kennedy added that the CBD glow has “synergistic downstream effects” in terms of social connections. “Around others, I find myself more present and attentive, more creative and open.”

To put my reaction in terms that Mr. Kennedy’s ilk would understand, I’d say the ROI on reading that paragraph was that I experienced an exciting disruption in the mouth sector, which, had I not cupped my hand over my lips, might just have gone viral all over my keyboard.
But while it’s fun to mock the eye-roll parade that the article provides, it also validates the claim made by Christie Aschwanden over at FiveThirtyEight: “the marketing has gotten way ahead of the science.”
Aschwanden is definitely more focused on the what than the why. Her article’s thesis is pretty well summed up by its headline: “Does CBD Really Do Anything?” There are definitely some serious WTF moments in here too. For example, when CBD-pedaling doctor Joe Cohen makes the claim that it has anti-cancer properties and might even help with Alzheimers, Aschwanden raises concern that these effects weren’t discussed in two of the most significant cannabis-focused reports out there. The good doctor’s reply: “I think you just have to Google search it.”
Moreover, though, she raises some important points, most notably that we don’t have mixed messages when it comes to CBD; we have almost no messages at all, because very few tests have looked at it on its own:

Animal models and a few human studies suggest that CBD can help with anxiety, but those are the only conditions with much research on CBD in isolation.

Otherwise, most studies focus on cannabinoids more generally, where they have actually found “‘conclusive or substantial evidence’ supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain in adults, multiple sclerosis-related spasticity (a kind of stiffness and muscle spasms), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”
Though, this assumes you’re getting a real dose, which also seems to be up in the air:

There are no guarantees that the label accurately reflects what’s in the product. For a 2015 study published in JAMA, researchers tested 75 products [cannabis] purchased in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle and found that only 17 percent were accurately labeled. More than half of the products contained significantly lower levels of cannabinoids than the label promised, and some of them contained only negligible amounts of the compounds.

The Conclusion
When we promise something here, we hold ourselves to it, so here comes: after reading about CBD, we can say, conclusively, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . But actually, it seems not to be super risky and to have some potentially great outcomes. So if you’re feeling anxious or a little achy, give it a try. Like most of this stuff, if you don’t think of it as a cure-all, you should be fine."	0.06			2018-11-02T04:00:05.893Z	0.42612956253890216	0.93	66292

It’s easy to come up with jokes about these things, and not just because they’re called “Lovesac Sactionals.” Like, imagine replacing all of a friend’s furniture with these one night, so they awake and believe they’ve grown. Or imagine a business man who uses them in his office as a power move, so that whenever someone comes to meet with him, they have to sit crouched to the ground feeling small.
But really, this hilarious world I’m describing, where everything is out of proportion is actually what young kids experience all the time, just inverted.
As @Superllama7 helpfully points out, “kids and pets can also use adult-sized furniture.” This is true, of course. Yet adult-sized furniture doesn’t really give kids a sense of ownership. Kids have toys and books. They have a bedroom they might share, and a bed to sleep in. But rarely are they given their own little space for quiet comfort in daytime, which is too bad, because it’s something they might like.
@2palms’s daughter did, at least: “with the double-wide seat she can get a leg up, then camp out in the corner with her books.” If that sounds super cute, I’ve got news for you: it is. @2palms includes two adorable pictures of “quiet morning reading time” on one of the 2 “chaise lounges” they put together. (@2palms elsewhere describes the Sactional furniture’s sturdiness, in case that’s a concern).
We should add that this time around, we’re selling them a bit differently than we did in September. Instead of doing it piece-by-piece, we’re offering a few different packages. You can get:
2 Seats, 4 Sides: Great for the kid who will occasionally keep the company of a couple action figures, perhaps a teddybear, but also enjoys a quiet night in with a good (pop-up) book.

That’s ridiculous, Lucy. It’s 2018; you need furniture for casual get-togethers.
8 seats, 10 sides: Basically everything you need to build a simple playpen, except one that’s softer and won’t raise the ire of your interior decorator friends.
Are they incredibly practical? Probably not. But they’re nice, and who knows, maybe your kids have been jonesing for a little quiet, relaxing space to call their own."	0.05			2018-11-01T04:00:05.247Z	0.27079811590159353	0.91	64234

Ladies and gentleman, friends and enemies, lovers and fighters, today we offer you something incredible: control of our most essential invisible resource, the very air we breath.
Birds? They are mere riders of the sky, nothing more than hangers-on. Airplanes? For all of their ingenuity, their undeniable feats of engineering, they still must heed the air’s wishes. When the air says, I shall have a massive storm here, in your flight path, does the plane puff out its chest and cry, Not today, air! Your storm can wait? No! The plane says, Ah, yes sir, yes sir, whatever you prefer, air! We shall find a new way to where we are going! And if the air says, The storm will be massive; there is nowhere to go, the plane replies with a nervous laugh, and says, Of course, sir! Totally understandable, sir! Take your time, sir! We will be right down here on the ground if you need us, sir!
In other words, birds are nihilists and planes are weak-willed.
You are neither.
The air might find its way through some unseen passageway into your house in the dead of night, at the height of winter. And it may say to you, Behold my dryness! It may say, Watch, as your knuckles fissure and grow red! Watch as your skin flakes! Watch as your lips chap, even in here, where you thought you were safe from my wrath! It will cackle with bitter delight as it watches you apply lotion and balm, knowing they are like cheap bandaids in the shadow of its vengeance.
Then the air will feel something itself, a chill. But more than that: it will feel the slow in-creep of moisture. It will say, Is there some glitch in your heating and cooling system? And you will point to your Pure Enrichment Cool Mist Humidifier, and you will say, “No, there is no glitch at all.” Then you will say, “Now dance, air!” And it will cry tears of humidity, but it will dance!

I, Clive Grunley, am not a mere athlete. Nor a biathlete. Nor a triathlete or anything so simple. No sir, I am a sexdecathlete, if you know what I mean!
What I mean is I compete in competitions comprising of sixteen distinct athletic feats. Why do you look so surprised? Did you think a sexdecathlete was something else?
A traditional sexdecathlon begins with a twenty mile run (1). Next, is a swim of at least 4 miles (2), but additional miles can be swum to earn tokens which can be used to hire additional bridge builders to help you build the bridge (3) back over the body of water you just swam across.
After that comes the javelin toss (4), followed by a short sprint (5), in order so that you can catch the same javelin you just tossed (6), and then, while holding it aloft, discuss with several gifted undergraduates how the javelin can serve, in literature, as a metaphor for one’s ascension and subsequent decline (7).
This is followed by a water break, which is not a break as in a moment of reprieve, but another event wherein each competitor builds a mold, pours water into it, freezes it, and then breaks the sculpture upon the shoulder of a competitor before they have one broken over theirs (8). Those who lose are disqualified, and given a strong handshake by those continuing on (9).
Next, you chop down a tree (10), then climb at least halfway up the tree (11), and carve some part of the three into a surfboard (12) while it is falling, so that you have something to ride when your tree eventually lands in the wave pool. You then ride a wave (13) to the artificial “shore” wherein a meeting ensues among remaining competitors as to how you might maintain the tree-related events while also promoting sustainability (14).
Which leaves nothing to do but cross the finish line (15) and exchange high fives (16). Yes, these count as events, as the finish line is a moat filled with poisonous snakes and we call them high fives because they must be completed atop a nearby mountain of you and your high-fiving partner’s choosing.
Anyway, the point being: after a long sexdecathlon, I’m beat. And I need at least three Wahl Ceramic & Gel Hot and Cold Packs to sooth my aches. I especially like that the texture provided by the ceramic beads allows for a nice massage. And let me tell you, us sexdecathletes might all be different, but every one of us likes a good rub!

Four truths and three lies about the artist Adam Koford:


Adam Koford, as a shirt designer often under the moniker of “Apelad”, has sold more than 260 designs on websites like Shirt.Woot, including several that this former Woot copywriter often still thinks of and laughs aloud.


Adam Koford’s art studio is in a house boat currently floating in international waters, the only place he can execute his diabolical pencil hold without being taken into police custody.


Adam Koford was, for a time, a jockey. He and his horse Maple Syrup were dominant, winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. On the track of the Belmont Stakes, though, disaster struck. Just feet from the finish line, Maple Syrup collapsed in a cloud of gray smoke, at which point it was discovered Maple Syrup was not a horse at all, but a robot powered, at its center, by a tiny car driving on a tiny treadmill.


Adam Koford is the creator of Laugh-Out-Loud Cats, a webcomic which can be viewed at HOBOTOPIA.com, as well as in a new book, One More For The Road, COMING SOON (stay tuned to Hobotopia for an official announcement in a couple weeks). A few months ago, he posted his 3000th Laugh-Out-Loud cats drawing. And since pictures are each worth a thousand words, that means Koford has produced the equivalent of 3 million words, the equivalent of somewhere between 30 and 50 novels. That’s impressive!


Adam Koford opens bananas by making several exacting surgical incisions with a scalpel. The peel-removal process can take up to two hours, but according to Koford, it’s worth it. “If you respect the fruit,” he says, “it will in turn respect you by unlocking heretofore hidden flavors.”


Adam Koford has worked as a senior writer and story artist on the video game versions of Bolt, Toy Story 3, and Cars 2. Which means he can say things like, “I wrote Toy Story 3,” and not technically be lying!


Adam Koford designed today’s shirt.

There’s basic relief. And then there’s the relief of finding that perfect something you’ve been looking for: that hair gel that works just right with your hair; that pair of running shoes that seems to be custom-built for your unique foot shape; that cut of jeans that fits like a dream.

That little operation in your brain that you’ve been forever running in the background, looking for that special something, can be discontinued, the energy rerouted.

Many considered A Portal Among The Pages, published in 1978, to be the book that marked science fiction author Hal Pembry’s ascension from merely great into the canon. His previous seven novels to that point had been entertaining and thought-provoking, but few managed to evoke the magic that Portal  seemed to achieve so easily. As one reviewer wrote, “When Finley [the book’s protagonist] first finds the Encyclopedia of Time, he does not know that it functions essentially as a time machine, yet he senses something special between the covers. Readers might find this sensation quite relatable, as they sit in their favorite chair, holding Pembry’s masterwork aloft.”
His fans were eager to see what he would come up with next. And they were profoundly disappointed when the answer turned out to be: nothing. Pembry never wrote another book. In fact, he disappeared altogether. Many assumed he’d gone the way of other successful literary eccentrics–that the fame had been too much for him and so he’d retired somewhere quiet for a life of seclusion. Others posited that the terrible film adaptation had driven him to flee out of embarrassment. A small faction of particularly conspiracy-minded fans put forward a theory of murder at the hands of Kyle Tolliver, a rival author driven mad by jealousy because his own stellar novel’s release had been eclipsed by Portal (this being a pun many newspapers made while discussing the books’ relative sales, as Tolliver’s concerned a deadly solar eclipse).
None of these theories came close to the truth. In actuality, Pembry’s novel was a confession of what was to come: he’d discovered a way in which he could, through literature, bend time. I know because he told me when I spotted him last week outside of a used bookstore in Omaha. He did not look a day older than his author photo from forty years ago.
I asked what he thought of life in our current age and he said, “It’s okay. There are many things that science fiction foresaw, only different in minor ways. There are robots that work for you, but the one’s that move have no personality, and the ones with personality don’t move. They live in speakers and phones. And then there’s that.”
He pointed to the GOTRAX Hoverfly ECO Hover Board I had ridden up on.
“I’ve read all about those. About how their electrical safety is certified, about how they can go nearly 8 miles per hour and up to 12 miles distance before needing a charge. It’s truly a work of ingenuity. Only, when I and many of my contemporaries had imagined hover-vehicles, I thought they would truly hover. Again, it’s not that I’m unimpressed. Sometimes, I wish there was just a bit more whimsy. At any rate, I ought to be going.”
I asked him where and he corrected me. “It’s when,” he said, then told me to name a year. 1919 was what came to mind, and he took out a small unmarked book from his blazer pocket, opened it to a specific page somewhere in the middle. “Ah,” he said. “Interesting.” He pointed to a line written on the page. I tried to lean over and see but in that moment, there came a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew, Pembry was gone."	0.05			2018-10-26T04:00:03.801Z	0.24495605686952773	0.93	63926

We all have our preferences when it comes to luggage. Some of us prefer the hard-sided rolling bag. We like that what we see is what we get, that its shape remains steadfast always. We find comfort in knowing that our things will be safe inside. Perhaps we go on a vacation and buy a commemorative glass; with our hard-sided luggage we can be sure that it will be safe, as long as you don’t pack it too loosely. You don’t have to worry about some other bag in the cargo crushing it.
Others of us prefer the duffel. It’s casual but also classic. It can go down the street to the gym, or across the world to Shanghai. If you don’t have much to pack, it’ll take up less space. You can pack lightly or overpack a little bit. Its soft sides are forgiving. Also: they’re malleable. Pack one full of clothes, and you can squeeze it almost anywhere. It’s like a firmer pillow.
And yet…
There are times when we wish our hard-sided luggage had just a little bit more give to fit in the tight space behind the passenger seat of a fully packed car. And there are times when we’d like trust our duffel to hold its shape just a little bit more. For example, when we travel to wine country in Oregon, we want to bring back a bottle of wine, not a bag full of wet wine-scented clothing and some decorative shards of glass.
In other words: when it comes to bag-style our preference is not as firm as we might think. And facing this knowledge, it quickly becomes clear that the options aren’t hard-sided or duffel. They’re:

We can refuse to choose. We can eschew bags altogether. We can wear all of the clothes we want to bring on a given trip, layered over each other. The top layer can be pair of cargo pants and a hoodie with a big pouch. In the pockets: our toiletries, our travel knickknacks, our phones, etc.

Or…

We can choose both. As in, we can buy one of each: a U.S. Polo hard-sided bag, and a U.S. Polo rolling duffel. If we’re going for ten days at the vase expo, we can bring the hard-sided luggage. If we’re driving across the country and want something that’s easy to roll in and out of motels every night, we can take the duffel. But with both, we always have what you need.

Okay, fine. This is manipulative. If you really want to buy just one or the other, that’s fine too… But know this: some day, you might regret that choice–some day, you might need those hard sides or that soft top–and when that day comes, we won’t be able to help you.

There’s a double-standard here. If you buy a shirt that’s slimming and shave every day because your facial hair comes in patchy or comb your hair a certain way that looks best with your face-shape, it wouldn’t be considered inauthentic. If anything, it’s the opposite. It shows an intelligence, an understanding of what you have and what works best. Because none of those things are harmful or uncomfortable or particularly time-consuming. They’re just simple steps you take to look your best.
On the other hand, if you try to slow the thinning of your hair–or at least slow the appearance of your hair thinning–that’s considered inauthentic. It’s mocked. Men are told that going bald is embarrassing, but also that covering up baldness is embarrassing. Because it exhibits some denial of reality, a fight against what nature has intended for you.
To which, we reply: Yeah, no shit! And there’s nothing wrong with that!
Maybe at some point, we can all wear ponchos, choosing between three or four each morning based solely on thickness of material. Those who are not going bald will stop cutting their hair, and those who are going bald will allow their hair to recede without ridicule. We will all stop showering, and we will all stop brushing our teeth, and we will cease complaining about the natural odors of our bodies and breath. And if some lose their teeth because theirs are weak, they will drink only nutritional juice of a greenish-brown color, and no one will judge them for it.
Until then, we just gotta do what we gotta do to look whatever way feels best. And if that’s using a hair fiber and locking spray, so be it.
(And P.S., yes: given that we have out spoken against pseudo-science in the past, we did give a healthy amount of side-eye to the marketing copy that claims, “negatively charged Moroccan cotton fibers adhere to positively charged individual strands of natural human hair at the root for a noticeably fuller look.” But here’s the thing: there’s a difference in how harmful it is to say some fibers make your head look nice versus claiming an aligned chakra is the best arthritis medicine, so we’ll let it slide.)"	0.05			2018-10-23T04:00:01.475Z	0.3256555514094781	0.94	62467			0.10346348247905289

“No,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s little knights, I’m sure,” the exorcist said. “They ride in upon plastic horses and jab you with their surprisingly sharp lances.”
“It’s not them either,” the toy seller said.
“Then it’s certainly dolls and stuffed toys,” the exorcist proclaimed. “Raggedy Annes and Andys, sock monkeys, and teddy bears, all singing ironic songs of friendship while stalking your every move, each brandishing pencils sharpened into shivs.”
“Actually,” the toy seller said, “it’s fidget spinners.”
“Wait, what? Fidget spinners? Seriously?”
“I’m afraid it’s very serious,” the toy seller said. “They just won’t stop… spinning.”
“That’s it,” the exorcist said. “They’re just spinning? Like fidget spinners do? But on their own?”
“Exactly! And I have work to do! But I can’t anything done! Because I’m so distracted by their infernal noises! Some of them even glow!”
The exorcist nodded. “I understand. They glow brightly with the spirits of the dead.”
“Nope,” the toy seller said. “They’re just the LED kind. And they don’t all glow very brightly. They’re pretty hit-or-miss, to be honest. A lot of them are fine, but the lights on some are dim, or out entirely. That’s why we’re selling them for cheaper than the non-LED ones.”
“Okay,” the exorcist said. “I think I know what to do. But I’ll need absolute privacy while I carry out the… um… exorcism. And I’m sorry to say, I’ll need to take the fidget spinners with me. To… ensure they don’t get possessed again or whatever.”
The toy seller did not object. In fact, he hugged him and thanked him with tears and his eyes. The exorcist assured him it would all be okay.

Welcome to everyone’s favorite day: Mediocre Screenprint Sunday, wherein we offer a new shirt or whatever every Sunday until, eventually, we get lazy or forget and it ends! Today’s shirt requires a little more explanation than the others. Basically, it’s the Casemates launch shirt, on royal blue… BUT you get a choice: the original sketchy version of the logo (and that’s sketchy as in sketch-like; not like, “it can’t be trusted”) or a new exciting more geometric-looking logo!
That leaves you with four potential purchase choices:
You Purchase The Classic Design
This the option for people who respect tradition. You want a shirt you can wear each night when you return to your victorian home and settle into your bergère chair to re-read Don Quixote. What’s that playing in the background? Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16, of course. And what’s that you’re drinking? Maybe a glass of 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir, or maybe a Boulevardier cocktail that you’ve been antiquing for a few days in a mason jar in the fridge. It all goes just smashingly with your new (or should we say old?) Casemates shirt!
You Purchase The New Design
Here, we have the modern choice. You’ll look right at home wearing this when you pull your electric car into the driveway of your house, a recent construction comprised, it appears, of only the most jagged of edges. Inside, you’ll ask your digital assistant to play the latest release from your favorite musician, a masked individual from a country far away who makes electronic music that is one step removed from the dial-up modem noise. Then you’ll settle in to read a collection of experimental prose poetry while sitting on a piece of brutalist furniture that might be a couch but also might be an end table; you can’t remember. What you are sure of: how comfortable you feel in your exciting new Casemates shirt!
You Purchase Both
This one goes out to all those who toe the line between classic and modern. You like mid-century modern furniture. You listen to blue-grass covers of new wave songs and new wave covers of blue-grass songs. In short, you appreciate all things: from the old and traditional to the new and innovative. If we may be so bold: this is definitely the best choice.
You Purchase Neither
This choice, on the other hand… well, it’s not really a choice at all. It’s the absence of one. You’ve essentially chosen not to choose. To put it bluntly, you are empty. You see stories about rescue dogs on Facebook and feel nothing. you stand directly in front of the elevator doors waiting for them to open, not because you’re in a rush, not because you think you’re better than other people, but because you haven’t thought at all. Often, you feel as though you’ve forgotten something. Your phone? No. It’s in your pocket. Your wallet? No. That’s there too. Your keys? No again. Really, you have forgotten nothing; instead, what you’re experiencing is the sensation of your being crying out to fill the hole where a soul should be.

Or maybe they could’ve called it a photo drone or a video drone, because it does have a camera that can take 1.3MP pictures and 720p videos. After all, drones are often used for photos or videos. My pretty basic wedding package featured a video done with a drone. Remember that shot at the end of 10 Things I Hate About You, of the band playing on the top of building while the credits rolled?

Still, what annoys me isn’t the how clear it is that this product was definitely named by some old dude thinking he’d discovered a new way to “reach the youth.” It had to be, by the way, because, say what you will about millennials, they at least know what a selfie is, and a photo that you need a drone’s angle to capture is not a selfie; it’s a photo with you in it. There’s a difference.
What annoys me is how reductive it is. It’s a dumb marketing 101. It thinks it’s carved out some entirely new lane in the drone game by catering to the selfie-obsessed among us, without taking into account the large number of people that it would turn off. Like, there are probably folks who arrived at the site today, read the product name, and said, “oh, no way,” and navigated away without reading another word. Or even if they did get further, they might still be thinking, It could be cool… but cool enough to risk my friends seeing a box that says “Selfie Drone” on it in the week before the recycling gets picked up?

Dear iRobot,
You’ve done what many companies aspire to do, but few actually achieve. In this stratosphere of success, your company is elite: Xerox, Kleenex, Ping Pong. Your product’s name–the Roomba–is now synonymous with (or maybe even supersedes) the “robot vacuum cleaner.” Congratulations.
And many of us here at Meh have been along for the ride since nearly day one. Yet, there’s something that’s frustrated us over the years: every time we sell a Roomba, we realize the model is slightly different than the previous one, despite looking almost exactly the same. We then dive into hours of research, hoping to solve the mystery of what’s so different in order to help our customers make an informed purchasing decision–only to find, in the end,  something trivial, like the canister capacity being one tenth of a percent larger than before.
What we’re saying here, iRobot, is: help us. Or, help us help you. Why not give every  new Roomba a feature that really STANDS OUT, so that they can be easily differentiated?
For example:


You could make one that says “sorry” whenever it bumps into a wall. An another that cries out in pain whenever it bumps into a wall. And another that recites a poem by Robert Frost in a Mike Tyson accent whenever it bumps into a wall.


Or a model that kisses your ankles when it goes by so that you know it loves you.


How about a Roomba that can take all the crumbs from the kitchen floor and forms them into new snacks for you to serve at your next party?


Maybe one Roomba could feature “pie warmth and texture.” And then the ""Plus ""version of that model could also feature “pie flavor.” And it could just be a pie.


Or what about a Roomba that just came with one completely functional human finger? Is that too much to ask?


Look, iRobot: the sensors, the 3-Stage Cleaning System, the ability to automatically adjust to any floor and navigate around furniture–that stuff is cool and all, but it’s also what we expect. Why not give people something a bit more unique? It would certainly be great for us. And if it’s great for us, isn’t it great for you too?
Just something to think about.

Twelve-year-olds Arthur and Lisa, having split up to cover more of the town, reconvened at the tree house to compare their trick-or-treat bounties. They’d both dressed as zombies, but even through all the gory face paint, their disappointment was clear.
“Another lame Halloween,” Arthur said. “It’s like, what’s wrong with giving out candy? Everyone around here tries to get too creative. I got the worst stuff.”
“You got the worst? Wait until you see what I’ve got,” Lisa said.
They sat down and began removing items from their respective glowing Pop Lights bags.
“Look at this,” Arthur said. “Someone gave me one Triscuit!”
“If you want something to dip it in, I’ve got a bunch of ketchup packets here from an old lady,” Lisa said. “Hey, what’s that sloshing noise?”
“Loose soup,” Arthur said. “The guy just ladled it into my bag.”
Lisa leaned over and looked. “Are those malt balls floating in it?”
“Nope. Meatballs. It’s Italian wedding.”
“At least you can eat that,” Lisa said. “I don’t know what to do with these ticket stubs from a 1992 Celine Dion concert.”
Arthur put on a pair of eyeglasses. “Let me see them.”
Lisa handed the stubs over. “I didn’t know you wore glasses.”
“I don’t,” Arthur said. “Someone on Fourth was handing these out.”
“New?”
“Gently used,” Arthur said.
“Maybe I could use them to read this.” Lisa pulled out a stack of papers from her glowing Halloween bag. “Guy on twelfth was giving out copies of his unfinished novel. And I need to have critiques back to him in two weeks.”
“How is it?”
“It’s okay. There are some point of telling issues. Like, if you’re going to use a retrospective POV, the narrator can’t be surprised by the events as they unfold. Also, some of the fantastical elements frustrate me. I keep thinking: what are the rules of this world?”
“Huh,” Arthur said. “I wouldn’t be much help. I’m a journalist, not a novelist. Or at least I am now that a woman on Church Street gave me this.” He handed a diploma over to Lisa.
“Wow, a journalism degree! From George Washington University! They could be really useful,” Lisa said, “for mopping up the soup!”
“Hey, good idea,” Arthur said.
“I have no idea what to do with this.” Lisa held a sheet of paper.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“An NDA,” Lisa said.
“For what?”
“I can’t tell you.”
The two of them fell silent for a moment.
“You want one of these I Trick-or-Treated 2018 stickers?” Arthur offered.
Lisa took one. “Thanks. You want any of these Spirit Airline points I got over on Main?”
“Sure. How about some opportunities to build real wealth and passive income through direct marketing? Someone on Grand was handing those out.”
“Couldn’t hurt,” Lisa said.
“That’s it for me,” Arthur said. “And to think: I thought my parents were the lame ones for handing out some fidget spinners they bought online. What a bust!”
“Actually, maybe it wasn’t a total bust. A family on Breezy Lane did give me this.” Lisa took it out and set it down between them.
“What is it?” Arthur asked.
“I think it’s another, smaller, Halloween.” Lisa pointed at something swirling. “See, look.”

Probably, we should lie. We should say that this is practical. We should say something like: you can garden from inside! We should claim something about how, with the success of HBO’s Sharp Objects, wealthy families have a renewed interest in dollhouses, and some of them are even hiring full construction crews to break ground and build them; get the heavy duty equipment your crew needs to beat out the other bidders!
But we won’t. Instead, we’ll look both ways, we’ll lean forward, we’ll gesture for your to lean forward too, and then we’ll whisper into your ear…
We’re selling this so you can give it as a gift.
We’re cautious to admit this because you know how people get. The holiday season is filled with camaraderie, but few forms are as cathartic as uniting against its annual encroachment. They’ve got the decorations up and it’s not even December, you’ll say to a stranger in the coffee shop. Are they playing “Jingle Bells”? Before Thanksgiving? someone will say in the checkout line at the grocery store. You’ll shake your head when Santa’s village appears in the mall before the first significant snowfall, or when you see a flyer informing you that Black Friday sales somehow start on Tuesday this year.
And here we are, making our first offering of the gift-giving season weeks before Halloween! What gall, you think. What nerve. But friends: hear us out. By offering this R/C Excavator today, we’re not trying to get a jump on anyone… but ourselves.
Though we don’t always act like it, at the end of the day, we’re a store. The holiday season should be our time to shine. And yet, to really “kill it” during the holidays, you need to be sure of yourself. You need to be organized, to know when things will ship and how long they will take to get to where they’re going. You need to build a balanced approached; you can’t just sell a bunch of toys or a bunch of electronics or a bunch of socks. You need to offer all three at different times based on sales trends from previous years.
But let’s be real here, Meh doesn’t exactly stand for “Meticulous, engaged, and hardworking.” It stands for… ummm… we don’t know. It was hard enough to come up with “Meticulous, engaged, and hardworking,” and honestly, now we could use a nap.

Two-for-Tuesday? Where’s the ambition in that? Yes, it sounds nice. But we can’t let alliteration lower our standards. So today, it’s four-for-Tuesday or twenty-four-for-Tuesday (which, I guess is technically alliterative).
That’s right, a choice between four or twenty-four. You know that means, it’s…
ORDER/HOARDER!!!
In these semi-regular sales, we provide two options: one a fair number of things for a good price; the other is an unfair number of things for a GREAT price. So, without further ado, let’s get started.
Today’s product is…
FLEECE BLANKETS!
I don’t know about where you all live, but here, the weather has taken a dark turn. It even snowed yesterday! Which means: it’s time to make a nice cup of tea or cocoa and bundle up under a fleece blanket on the couch with one to twelve dogs and/or cats for the next five months.
THE MATH
The four-pack will run you $14. That’s $3.50 per blanket. Not bad, right? But wait! The twenty-four pack goes for $60. That’s $2.50 per blanket. But wait even more! If the first four cost $14, that means the last twenty cost just $46, which is $2.30 per blanket! Does it make sense to break it down like that? Probably not! But that’s how we do it here on Order/Hoarder days!
WHAT TO DO WITH FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
With four fleece blankets, you can put one on the couch, one on recliner, keep one in the office, and still have a backup to rotate in when one is being washed. Or, store them all in a closet and break them out for a late fall bonfire.
WHAT TO DO WITH TWENTY-FOUR FLEECE BLANKETS
So! Much! For example:


You could give them out as gifts to twenty-four of your favorite people!


Or, if you don’t have twenty-four favorite people, give them as gifts to twelve of your favorite people! (You can use the remaining twelve fleece blankets as wrapping paper for the other twelve fleece blankets!)


Send one to each venue on your favorite band’s 24-stop winter tour to show you’re a true fan!


Or, give one to all but four members of the twenty-eight piece Swedish indie pop group, I’m From Barcelona, in case they have to play any cold weather outdoor festivals! If they complain about not everyone getting a blanket, just tell them you’re not the idiot who decided to start a twenty-eight person band!


Use them to build a winter-ready tent in the bank yard! Actually, hell, you’ve got 24 fleece blankets! Build a winter-ready tent mansion!


Interior decorators will tell you that the right lighting can give rooms a soft, warm feeling; we say, why stop at lights? Why not take that “soft, warm feeling” over the top by wallpapering your house with fleece blankets?


See? Maybe twenty-four fleece blankets isn’t so impractical after all.
So, what’s it going to be: are you going to place a boring old order, or are you going to take the exciting first steps to becoming a fleece blanket hoarder?"	0.05			2018-10-16T04:00:03.596Z	0.3410857897640822	0.93	63281

Let’s start off general and work our way into more specifics. Every laptop manufacturer calls their product something different, but a Chromebook isn’t just a cool name. It’s actually a different kind of computer. Laptop Magazine sums it up nicely:

Instead of Windows 10 or macOS, Chromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. These machines are designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with most applications and documents living in the cloud.

In other words, if you live in a cabin somewhere in the mountains, and you have to hike and ski many miles back to civilization to grab a solitary bar of wi-fi, this might not be your best bet. Nor would it be a good option if you’re looking for a machine that can support your career cutting movie trailers and playing the latest computer games. These things are pretty sparse, in terms of power.
But for the rest of us, who pretty much never stray far from the router and who mostly use our computers for checking email, keeping track of things, writing, and organizing: a Chromebook is actually a pretty great, pretty cheap option.
And this one is actually both of those things: we’re selling it for just under $150, and on Amazon it has four stars on over 1,000 reviews.
Yes, if you want to be cynical, you could say: but wait, Meh, this thing came back out who-knows-when, and many of those reviews were written a while ago. And that’s true. BUT 1) there were still five star reviews coming in as recently as August of 2018; and 2) never underestimate the online reviewer. Like, these people self-identify as arbiters of all that is good (and not good) to buy; do you really think they wouldn’t rush to update their review the minute anything goes wrong?
Besides, let’s be totally honest: as much as we like to talk about the forward march of tech, most of us are still using our computers for the exact same things as we did five years ago. New apps come and go, but we’ll always need to make spreadsheets and type up documents and check our email.
Who knows? Maybe it’s a blessing it’s a little older: it might mean it was unaffected by the Gmail redesign. That’d be worth the price alone, if you ask us!"	0.05			2018-10-15T04:00:05.520Z	0.2839675274780344	0.93	64996

Mr. Khool was the coolest teacher at Meh High. He taught an elective called The Mathematics of Skating, a class he only managed to get approved after bringing the principal to a skate park and catching phat air while explaining how each side of a halfpipe was essentially a graph of exponential growth. Now, he was on his way to teach his first session of it when, rounding a corner, he heard stifled sobs.
Narf, hunched next to the water fountain, tried to straighten up when he saw Mr. Khool approaching. “Oh, hey, Mr. Khool. I was just… uh… making sure the fountains weren’t leaking.”
“Sounds like the only thing leaking are your eyes, l’il guy,” said Mr. Khool, crouching next to him. “You want to talk about it?”
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Narf said. “It’s just… well… I feel like when all the other kids ask for stuff, they get it right away. Toothbrushes. Jerky. Fidget spinners. But I’ve been asking for the same thing for years, and nobody takes me seriously.”
“I know what you’re going through,” Mr. Khool said.
“You do?”
“Sure! Being a cool guy is great, but sometimes it’s hard to get people to take me seriously. They think it’s all kick flips and cliff jumps, when really that’s only like 60 to 70 percent of what I do. There’s also a lot of hard work that nobody gives me credit for. But you know what? Whenever I start to feel like maybe it’s time to trade my longboard in for a Prius, I remind myself: there’s a reason progress and persistence both start with p. A friend of mine told me that once. His name was Tony Hawke.”
Narf’s eyes went wide. “Tony Hawk the skateboarder?”
“No,” Mr. Khool said. “This is Hawke with an e. He was Ethan Hawke’s second cousin. We played in a band together in college. And actually he went by Anthony.”
“So do you just call him Tony Hawke so people think you’re talking about Tony Hawk?”
“It doesn’t matter why I do it,” Mr. Khool said. “The point is, it’s a decision I made to call him Tony. And we all have decisions to make in this life. So, are you going to give up, or are you going to decide to keep chasing your dreams?”
Narf stood up. “You’re right! It doesn’t matter that it’s taken this long! I can’t give up now, not for anything!”
“That’s right! So, what is it that you’ve been asking for?”
“A cat shirt,” Narf said.
“Wait, seriously?” Mr. Khool said, getting to his feet. “But you’re Narf. You’re wearing a cat shirt right now. And you wore one yesterday. And the day before that. And actually every other day too. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the same cat shirt twice, now that I think about it.”
Narf slung his backpack over his shoulder. “Sorry, Mr. Khool. I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve gotta get to chem. Thanks again! You really said exactly what I needed to hear!”
“That’s great,” Mr. Khool said. “Although, maybe we need some other designs?”
But Narf was already off and running to his next class.

Douglas, We’re glad you’re here. We can see you’re confused, but don’t worry: all will be explained. You see, when LeAnn said to come home so you two could “take a scenic flight over a pristine lake” together, she was lying. This is an intervention. We, your friends and family–we’re all worried about you, Douglas.
It all began when you bought that Odyssey Stellar NX Drone. You said it was a way to bond with your son. But you didn’t let Trevor use it much, did you, Douglas? Still, it was a fun hobby for you. You liked that it came with a VR headset, so you could see from the drone’s POV. You would fly it, recharge it, fly it, recharge it, all day.
Only after a few months did we start to see the warning signs. You walked into furniture, cursing your legs. You started standing on the dining table to watch television. You called this “a more natural prospective.”
Then there was the mini drone that came with your purchase of the original drone. You started calling it ‘l’il guy,’ then ‘son,’ then finally you named it. It would’ve seemed cute, if you didn’t choose, ‘Trevor,’ the same name as your real son.
Yes, Douglas, that’s right: only one of them is your real son. Because you are not a drone, Douglas! You are a man! You might spend days coming out of drone-prospective for only as long as it takes your Odyssey to charge. You might spend these times with your eyes closed tight, whispering, “it’s a dream, it’s just a dream,” so as not to face the fact that you are a human being, and as such, you are bound by gravity to remain on the ground.
But it’s not healthy, Douglas! You have a family! You have a job! You have obligations! You can’t just ignore them because you have “a new life in the sky” now. It can be a fun hobby, but you’ll never really be a drone, Douglas. You need to start seeing that. And moreover, you need to apologize to all of us for what you’ve put us through.

User @alacrity wants one thing and one thing only: a margarita.
When we sold a Copper Cookware set, they wrote:

well, I guess I could serve margaritas in these…

On a two-pack of posture trainers:

it has to be said: these make really shitty margaritas.

For a 2-pack of cast aluminum skillets:

well, I guess I could drink a margarita out of em… but there’s still the salted rim thing.

A coffee maker:

this will make very hot margaritas.

Earrings:

these are absolutely useless for margaritas.

You might notice that these are not all sales from the last few months. No, @alacrity has lived with desire for years. But that will change today. Because today we are selling a Cuisinart Waring Pro Blade Blender.
And yet the story does not end here. What we want to know is: how does @alacrity feel about this?
Will they arrive at the site today relieved? Will they cry aloud, “For many years I have wished for nothing more than a sweet lime-rich tequila cocktail. And at long last, the great Meh has delivered to me a device that shall itself deliver me to my own personal paradise. Thank you, Meh! Thank you so much!”?
Or will they feel some resentment? Will they realize, all too late, that the real margarita was the friends they made along the way? Or, to put it differently: is there any margarita that’s as sweet on the lips as camaraderie is to the heart?
And yet, there remains a fact we have not reconciled: uhh, like, hello? We’ve sold blenders before!
So perhaps we’re misreading @alacrity. Perhaps, they do not hope for their own margaritas at all. Perhaps they seek only to be a sort of margarita-specific town-crier, to stand in the virtual park at the center of Meh and warn all those around them about the dangers of attempting margaritas in products not optimized for margaritas.
And then of course, there is the final possibility: maybe @alacrity prefers margaritas on the rocks.
So what is it? Only time will tell. And by time, we mean: hopefully @alacrity in the forums."	0.05			2018-10-12T04:00:20.860Z	0.34750686103289724	0.94	59130

Watches? I never wear watches. Why would I wear a watch in the age of cellphones? That’s what I say. Because I believe in efficiency. It guides my every waking move, from the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the time I lay down to sleep at night. (That’s the alarm on my phone, by the way. Why have an alarm clock when you have a cell phone?)
But it’s one thing to say you believe in efficiency, and it’s a whole other thing to live by it. I know because I do. To prove it, I’ll run through my average morning:
First thing’s first, I make breakfast. It’s the same every day: spaghetti and meatballs. I have it for lunch too. And dinner. Food is food, isn’t it? Why should I have different foods for different meals?
When I’m done eating, I floss and brush my teeth, then spit into the drain in my shower. Because why have a sink when you have a shower? Is not a shower a human-height sink? Think about that for a second. Anyway, when I’m done brushing my teeth, I wash my hands with shampoo. Soap-products are soap-products, after all! Then I shave, checking my reflection in the mirror–by which I mean, my phone, on selfie mode.
A little bit of leisure time is part of being efficient too. So, before heading out the door to work, I take twenty minutes to relax. I might watch a show (on my phone) or read a book (on my phone). But soon enough it’s time to check the weather (on my phone). To confirm the app, I look out the window–the single window I have in my whole house. Why do I need to see out my house from so many different sides? Outside is outside, no matter what way you’re looking at it. One window is plenty.
Using this information, I decide what I’m going to wear: pants or shorts. I should elaborate; it’s the one garment, but it’s got a zipper so I can unzip them at the knee when it gets warm. It’s the same pair I wear every day, because again, for me it’s all about efficiency. Not everyone is a fan of this. My sister, for example, once said she actually hated my zip-on pant-shorts. She said I should switch things up by wearing something else sometimes. She said that by wearing them I was ruining her wedding. Can you believe that?
She hasn’t spoken to me since then, but I don’t mind. I still have another sister, and honestly, at the time, I was in the middle of a painful decision of which sister I would keep. Two sisters? Are you crazy? Who needs all that in your life?
Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh, right: these watches. Yep, don’t need them. Although, they would go nicely with the one sweatshirt always I wear, especially on days when it’s hot enough that I have to roll up the sleeves. And if you’re wondering why I don’t just take it off, it’s simple: I’m not wearing anything underneath. Wearing a shirt under what is essentially another shirt? That’s nuts!"	0.06			2018-10-11T04:00:06.347Z	0.3548942995103143	0.93	61867

Imagine for a moment you’re a secret agent. You’ve been called upon to infiltrate a very important party held by a tycoon with designs to take over the world. You need to take a video of the party, so key attendees can be identified, and hopefully sneak into the study where you’re told the plans for the doomsday device are kept. For this mission, you’ll be provided with a PogoCam. It’s smaller than a tube of lip balm, attaches magnetically to your favorite pair of glasses, and shoots 5 megapixel photos and 720p HD videos. You just need to go to Q to collect it.
FYI: in this imagined scenario, Q refers to the dumpster behind the Qwikmart convenience store down the block, not the genius gadgeteer from the movies. Because, boy oh boy, would that guy steer clear of this thing.
In fact, over on Amazon the PogoCam only has 2.5 stars. That’s some real ruh-roh territory, especially given most products fall into a 3 star rating just by being delivered. People who bought it without the Pogotrack sunglasses offered here griped about the safety loop required when using your own pair.  Others complain about the picture quality or that it only takes 30-second video clips.  One user goes even further: “while I have little proof,” LE says, “[I] believe PogoCam has been the cause of much of the world’s turmoil lately.”
Not great!
But here’s the thing: since it’s come out and been revealed to be of less than desirable quality, the PogoCam’s price has tanked. In fact, I’m told that at one point is retailed for as high as $150. That’s nuts. But even with all those price drops, it’s still just shy of 50 on the 'zon.
We’re selling it for $24. For that price, it can just be a fun little gimmicky impulse buy. Wear it once or twice and you’ve pretty much justified the purchase. If you get it to work better than a bunch of Amazon reviewers and find some real use for it, awesome! If not, at least you got some sweet magnetic sunglasses out of the deal.

There were only two of them in the conference room, but when the engineer placed the SmartStand prototype on the table, his hands still shook with anxiety, as if he were making a presentation to the entire company. In a way, he was. Across the table sat the founder and CEO.
“Looks simple.”
“Just as you asked, sir,” the engineer said.
“So let’s talk features,” said the CEO. “It can hold your tablet or phone while you’re cooking, so that the recipe is easy to read?”
“Yes, sir,” said the engineer.
“And it tracks the ingredients used, placing orders based on what’s running low in your cabinet and refrigerator?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it intuit how romantic a given meal seems, and adjust the room’s lighting accordingly?”
“No, sir.”
“Does it feature an olfactory sensor that reads the smell of the meal and gives spicing advice?”
“No, sir.”
“Let’s talk about travel use: on an airplane, it can hold up your phone or tablet making it easier to watch a show or movie?”
“Yes, sir.”
“And it can place drink orders with the flight attendant, based upon the mood of said show or movie?”
“No, sir.”
“Can it message the gate attendants of your connecting flight, informing them when delays get in the way of your lunch or dinner plans, so they know to have a torta from Frontera waiting for you?”
“No, sir.”
“Tell me that it can at least read the forecast for your destination and place orders for weather-appropriate pants.”
“It can’t, sir.”
The CEO stared for a long time at the prototype. “So, it’s not ‘smart’ at all?”
“Well, sir,” the engineer said, “I like to think of it like this: by adding a number of attention-grabbing but ultimately unnecessary and overcomplicated ‘smart’ features, we’d only introduce the possibility for bugs and glitches. Not to mention we would have to put out different models for different phones and tablets. So, despite how it may seem, this is a ‘smart’ product, in that simplicity is smart, because it leads to ease of use and universal compatibility.”
The CEO pounded his fist on the table. “I like that! I like that a lot! Not smart is actually smart! That’s great! That’s gonna help me a lot, not just at work, but also in my personal life!”
“Actually, sir, what I said was simplicity is–”

We’re entering the time of year when everything freezes and dies and allergies are replaced by a sense of tired dryness. For some of you, this might be a relief. And yet, consider these two things: first, said dryness does nothing to dry up non-seasonal allergies, like those related to pets; and second, spring will be back sooner than you think with its pollen-thick air. And just like the smart shopper buys next year’s wrapping paper the day after Christmas when it’s marked down to nothing, so too does he or she purchase an allergen-optimized vacuum just as allergy season winds down.
And boy oh boy, does this thing suck up allergies. In fact, it “captures and traps 99.9% of dust and allergens down to 1 micron.” As a non-allergy-sufferer myself, I don’t know exactly what that means. I can tell you that, given the the word “micron” is pretty much just “micro” with an n, it sounds pretty small.
What I actually CANNOT understand is what the fuck “MultiFLEX Technology” is. I know that it “provides flexible reach for under furniture and freestanding, compact storage.” But what does that mean, exactly? Digging a little deeper, I found that the “MultiFLEX wand bends so you don’t have to, reaching under low lying furniture with ease.” So, apparently, it’s a kind of semi-flexible wand? That’s it? Seriously?
But friends, I’m not mad. No, not at all. In fact, I think it’s smart. Genius even! Every feature of every product, regardless of how mundane, should get the marketing-speak treatment. For example:

Yes, on one level, the design is simple: it’s the Meh face, or should we say, the many (meh-ny) Meh faces you see when you come to our site. It’s a button. You press it. You keep a streak going, if you want. Or else you don’t; you reserve the Meh button only to show your nonplussedness. It’s something that makes our site special, a little inside joke among you, the customer, and us.
But, on another level, the design means so much more. It’s a tribute. To us. And all we’ve done for the world of commerce. Before we came along, all was excitement, and much of it was false. Companies didn’t know that it was fine enough to be, well, fine enough. Everything had to be glorious and exuberant. But then we showed up, and we taught people that it doesn’t always have to be that way. You don’t have to worry about moving the proverbial needle. You don’t need to dial it up to a ten. You can hang out at a five if you want.

It’s pretty simple, except for one wrinkle, which is that you get to choose what capacity power bank you want: 4200, 6000, or 9000 mAh. Now, most modern phones can be fully charged with between 2000 and 3000 mAh, which means even the smallest power bank we’re offering can charge your phone somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times. By that standard, you could get 2.5 to 3 full charges with a 6000 mAh power bank, and 4.5 to 5 with the 9,000.
But look, we’re not going to spend the next few hundred words talking math. It’s too abstract. The most helpful thing to do would be to provide brief profiles for who might require each power capacity, so that you identify yourself among them. Here goes:

You’ve got a full day ahead of you, enacting archaic rituals and making shady transactions in a number of parks in and around Cincinnati. And let’s just say the Corrigans didn’t factor in any time for you to stop and juice up your phone. Which is a problem, because you need to be face-timing the entire time so they can be sure you don’t call the cops. In short: you’re gonna need some serious recharge power.

You find that you have an intense desire to work out. You go running and clock 18 miles easily. The next day you go further. And further after that. Soon you’re running up mountains just to get your heart rate going. You’ve made partner at the firm, which is crazy because you don’t remember becoming a lawyer. The paychecks are amazing.

Each year, representatives from all 50 European countries gather for the EuroSock Summit to discuss potential changes to the sock’s age-old design. Here is a summary of year’s Summit, which took place in Luxembourg in a chamber deep inside the Grand Ducal Palace:


The representative from Sweden proposed changing the design, so that the sock appeared strangely both modern yet antiquated, like a torture device, but also attractive and entirely comfortable. Motion failed to pass by a vote of 11 to 39.


The representative from Italy proposed making the next EuroSock as soft as the richest pillowy ball of burrata, as delicate to touch as the most sumptuous pluck-able leaves of basil, and yet as firm as tagliatelle cooked to a perfect al dente. Also: more garlic. Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 19 to 31.


The representative from France proposed making the sock from a distinct material that would grow delightfully crusty over night, so to it could be enjoyed the next day. There was some confusion over this, but eventually the representative from France admitted she was simply hungry, having been disappointed in her hotel’s bread options that morning at breakfast. Motion failed to make it to a vote.


The representative from Norway proposed making the sock seven times thicker. When someone suggested he have multiple pairs of socks–some for summer, others for winter–he smiled and nodded, saying, “Yes, exactly! These would be for summer!” Motion failed to pass, by a vote of 3 to 47.


The representative from Ireland proposed making the socks out of a darker fabric, one “as pitch black as a Guinness.” The representative from Belgium chimed in to add that the fabric should be strong, “not unlike a delicious quadrupel.” The German representative also leaned forward to propose adding a pinch of sea salt, “one of the key ingredients in a traditional gose.” When they all three broke down laughing it became clear that they’d partaken in a few of the aforementioned beverages during the break for lunch.

When I first saw that we were selling an air fryer, I was torn.
On the one hand, Wirecutter pretty emphatically stated that they don’t recommend these things for how expensive they are. If you’re not familiar with Wirecutter, they’re basically one of the best and most straightforward resources for when you’re buying kitchen appliances, electronics, and just about everything in between. They do a lot of research and provide simple, easy-to-understand articles replete with concrete purchasing recommendations. So, their opinion carries a lot of weight.
On the other hand, my dad has an air fryer and he likes it.
Two venerable sources. Two contradictory opinions. I didn’t know who to trust. So I began to dig deeper. Here’s what I found:


While working on his Wirecutter article, Michael Sullivan conducted more than 35 hours worth of air fryer tests. In the end, he was so unimpressed with them that he recommended buying a simple convection toaster oven to get a better bang for your buck.


Back when I was in high school, my dad used to change my car’s oil. Not just check it, mind you, but perform a full-blown change. He had a little pit in the garage, so you could pull your car right in and he’d take care of it every 3000 miles.


Given those two facts, I came to the following conclusion: it was possible that my dad had also used his air fryer for 35 total hours, yet it was very unlikely that Michael Sullivan had ever changed the oil in my car when I was in high school. This seemed like a pretty clear “checkmate” situation. But then I remembered that an air fryer’s greatest selling point is its oil-free frying. Thus, it only seemed fair that all oil-based arguments need be discarded. I found myself right back at square one.
Then it hit me: my dad is a Meh customer. He likely bought his air fryer right here on this very site. Meanwhile, Wirecutter suggests a model that retails at about $250, which is FIVE TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS ONE. Furthermore, they never say they’re outright bad; they just say they aren’t worth the money. Which makes sense: my dad would likely not be the satisfied air-frying customer he is today had he been required to fork over more than 200 bucks.
Therefore, Wirecutter, I know we’ve suggested this before, but if you’re reading this, consider an addendum to your initial verdict of “Not recommended”: something like, “unless it’s selling on Meh for almost a fifth of the cost, in which case, go to town.” I’d be happy to put you in touch with my dad if you need any more information."	0.05			2018-10-03T04:00:13.622Z	0.4058992852291472	0.92	65054		0.15524434813545068

In the grand scheme of things, I’m pretty smart about health stuff. No, not necessarily among other humans. I mean in the REAL grand scheme, as in: among all living creatures in the world. I sometimes eat too many donuts, or drink so much coffee that I give myself a headache. But I at least KNOW what I’ve done immediately after I’ve done it. And compared to my cats or my dog, I come out looking like a friggin’ genius!
For example, I won’t find my way into the trash and attempt to consume a giant wad of paper towels that were used to soak up frying oil, only to slink behind the couch and embarrassedly vomit it up. And if I found myself stuck in a bathroom, I would wait patiently until someone got home and ask them for some help. I would not, under any circumstances, try to EAT MY WAY OUT, causing enough damage so that both the door and the trim need to be replaced, and giving myself a pretty rough tummy ache along the way. Another point in my favor: I understand the utility of pills as well as the ease with which they can be taken. They don’t need to be hidden in cheese or loaded into a little plastic contraption to be shot deep into my throat in order to induce swallowing. I just take them!
And yet, even as I type these gloating words, I’m sitting in a rickety wooden chair, leaning awkwardly over my laptop. Unlike the damage of a few too many donuts or a bit too much coffee, I won’t feel the effects of my bad poor posture for many years. And yet, I know this, but I do nothing to correct it.
In a way, poor posture is like the human version of eating out of the garbage. We just can’t help it. Instead of taste-testing rotten meat or chewing on plastic bags, we hunch. And just as pets need help learning what they should and should not do, often for their own good, so do we.
That’s where this this Posture PT Confidence Corrector comes in. It can fit onto just about any chair–from office chairs to the driver’s seat of your car–and it improves posture, which in turn strengthens your core and reduces lower back and shoulder pain. Or, to put it differently, it’s not unlike a spray that makes bad posture smell like sour apples!
Okay, that’s going a little overboard with the pet metaphor thing. It’s not a spray. It’s a posture corrector. Sorry for the confusion. Now buy one, and straighten out your life. Got it?"	0.05			2018-10-02T04:00:03.835Z	0.31486252125742953	0.93	62431

Today’s sale leaves us conflicted. On the one hand, this would seem like an Order/Hoarder sale: you’re given options, some more reasonable than others. On the other, it’s not exactly the same as past Order/Hoarder sales we’ve offered. For example, there are more than two options. So, if you don’t mind, we thought we could work through this together, with a little Q&A:
How does the math break down?
This is a little more complicated than usual. You can get a 40 pack of basic fidget spinners for $14 ($0.35/spinner) or a 40 pack of LED fidget spinners for $16 ($0.40/spinner). But you could also get a 160 pack of both LED and basic fidget spinners (an 80 and 80 split) for $34. Which is about $0.21 per spinner… except, if you think about it: the first 40 basic spinners cost $14 and the first 40 LED spinners cost $16, which adds up to $30. So that’s a mere $4 for the last 80 fidget spinners, or a nickel per! CRAZY!
So then why wouldn’t this be an Order/Hoarder sale?
For three reasons:


As mentioned above, it’s not an either/or. There are three options.


40 fidget spinners will already have you well on your way to hoarding fidget spinners; but, more importantly…


These aren’t really for hoarding! We’re offering them now, because we want  to get them to you with plenty of time to spare before the end of the month. That way, you can offer them out to Trick Or Treaters on Halloween. That doesn’t sound very hoarderly at all, does it?


Why wouldn’t you just give candy away on Halloween like everyone else?
Because fidget spinners are fun and will last longer. Also, this site is run by someone from Saint Louis where some people give out jokes instead of chocolate, so it’s kind of on brand for us to eschew the national standard for Halloween practices.
Wait, back up: what even ARE fidget spinners?
They’re goofy little spinny toys with no real purpose other then to be fidgeted with.
That’s sorta dumb, isn’t it?
You might think so, but in a world where people try to sell peppermint-scented oil as an alternative to physical therapy, I find it refreshing that there’s a product out there that’s explicitly for useless goofings-off.

You might wear the shirt proudly at first: to work, or out to grab drinks with friends, or when you’re on vacation, or when you’re visiting family. The people around you might ask, “Who made that shirt?” And you might respond: “Meh.” But really, you’ll want to say: “Me. I made it. Or I made it possible.

On September 13th, user @djslack offered up a list of potential things we could sell, including “some kind of interesting jerky type product.” And so here we are selling delicious Wicked Cutz jerky!
Now, we need to make two things clear:
First, this is some pretty classy jerky. Therefore, the price tag isn’t going to be exactly in line with the Slim Jim that you buy on a whim as you check out at the grocery store, only to open it in your car and for the noxious smell to make you regret your decision, although not enough to stop you from eating it. Hypothetically speaking. Point is: this is good jerky and good jerky costs money.
Second, and more importantly: we need to make something EXCEEDINGLY clear. We saw @djslack’s suggestion and considered it, but the decision to sell the jerky ultimately came down to us and us alone. In fact, there’s a chance that we subconsciously were thinking about selling jerky and so @djslack didn’t exactly give us the idea as much as surface it.
What we’re saying is: we’re not necessarily in the business of outsourcing our product selection. As in, we don’t do requests. As in, don’t get used to this, okay? Because this is it. The party ends here.
We say this because ever since we sold some toothbrushes as a joke–that’s right, it was a joke! A joke ON YOU!–we know there have been rumblings on the forums about something you’d like us to sell. That’s how obstinate we are, people: we won’t even name the item. We won’t even write the word. Because we are unmovable.
We’re like a brick wall. People always tell us that. They say, “Talking to you all is like talking to a brick wall.” Which we take as a compliment concerning our strength. And also our attractiveness, given that brick is a very beautiful building material. In certain cases, at least. Maybe not in some of the suburban architecture of the mid-fifties. But then again, those homes have a certain nostalgic beauty in a way. There’s a pure American warmth to them, isn’t there?
What were we talking about? Right: how we’re not a bunch of pushovers, and you can’t boss us around and tell us what to sell!

Dearest Professor Alba,
First off, a hearty congratulations on winning the Henning Prize. Your self-adhering bow-tie is certainly a masterwork, and the award is absolutely deserved. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the ceremony. As I am sure you are aware, since my expulsion, you are my sole correspondent from the Meyer Institute of Alchemic Fashion. But my choice not to attend is not due to some fear of seeing my former classmates and teachers again–or, more accurately, of experiencing their fear as they witness me. No, I cannot attend because I have fallen ill, and I fear this may be the last letter I ever write.
Although, perhaps ‘fallen ill’ is a simplification, as the illness under which I suffer has no name.
The trouble began in my makeshift lab late one night. I was working on a new stitch technique, making minor tweaks to it here and there over the course of several weeks. It was going nowhere, and after one particularly long day toiling in the haberdashery (with no Meyer Certification, I am forced to do such menial labor), I came home so exhausted and angry that I decided to throw it all away in favor of something entirely new.
I am sure you will be disappointed to hear this. During my expulsion hearings, you were the strongest voice in my favor. When the administration said that I “endangered” all those around me with the “diabolical recklessness” of my work, you told them it was just a phase. But Professor Alba, it was not. And while I am not proud to admit that, I am also not exactly not proud either.
For that evening, in my lab, I created something amazing: a stitch unlike any other stitch; a stitch that seemed to take time into it, that seemed to steal tiny slivers of the universe’s fabric and convert them into pure style. It was a stitch that resembled a stitch in only an ethereal way, like a word in another language whose definition we can on some level understand but for which there is no direct translation. I sewed up some pairs of socks with the stitch; despite using bland monochrome fabrics, each pair came out patterned with a bold unpredictable design.
I learned all too late that it was taking something from me as well, that it was essentially draining my life energy, weaving it among each sock’s seams. I fashioned a lead coat to wear while working, but it was too late. The damage has been done. I write this letter to you from bed, Professor Alba, a bed from which I fear I may never again rise. Indeed, just the act of writing has left me pale and exhausted.
But this is not a letter merely bidding farewell to you and this world. You will find, in the envelope, the detailed plans for the aforementioned stitch (as well as for the protective coat). I cannot say what I want for you to do with them. Some days I hope you will set them aflame and think of them no more; other days I hope you will use them to start a line of vibrant and delightful socks to sell around the world.
But, Professor Alba, promise me this: if you choose the latter, make sure to warn the people, to let them know the truth, that these are not simply stitched socks.

This compact first aid kit is exactly what it says it is: a small kit for administering first aid. It has tweezers. It has scissors. And it has one bazillion (read: 121) pieces, including all the gauze, pads, bandages, and alcohol prep packs that you’d need to treat any (read: any NOT super major) wound you sustain while camping, or picnicking, or what have you. Its size makes it the ideal first aid kit to buy, leave in your car, and just forget about until you need it.
That’s all pretty simple.
But what comes next? This is what no one ever talks about: how to build and successfully administer a second aid kit. Luckily, we can help.
Step 1: Gather your supplies. You will need a chair (worn, in an endearing, well-loved way); a blanket (soft, warm, but not too warm); a cat (purring); and a remote control (to a Roku, Apple TV, or comparable).
Step 2: Apply ass to chair. (Optional, recline chair or use ottoman to extend legs).
Step 3: Apply blanket to lap and/or legs.
Step 4: Apply purring cat to blanket at lap area. Pet cat occasionally.
Step 5: Apply hand to remote; locate a binge-worthy show on your television; press play.
Step 6: When your significant other or roommate enters the room and asks if you’re really going to spend all day just sitting there watching television, sigh and say, “You’re right,” then move (very slightly) to get up, stopping only to hiss with pain and grasp at the injury area where the first aid was administered. (Optional: parlay sympathy, if shown, into your significant other or roommate bringing you a hot beverage of your choice: coffee, tea, cocoa, or apple cider.)
Step 7: When your significant other or roommate leaves the room, replace purring cat (if riled by your attempt to get up), rewind show as needed, and resume viewing.
There: you’ve successfully built and administered a second aid kit. Now, just buy this compact first aid kit, and you’ll be all set!"	0.04			2018-09-25T04:00:05.576Z	0.2809856978279806	0.95	74445

Overview: Very good, but not as good as Michael Keaton!!!
Before I get into my review, I want to give you a little bit of background: I’m a huge Michael Keaton fan and a software developer. Recently, I sold my start-up to a large tech conglomerate for several million dollars. I used that money to build a bunker inside an abandoned warehouse where I would live and wait for Michael Keaton to arrive so I can ask him a few continuity-related questions about his seminal 1996 comedy, Multiplicity, for my podcast: The Podkeast. I won’t list the questions here because I am certain they’ve never been asked and I want to be sure I’m the ones who asks them (more on this below, when I get into the complaints).
I need peace in my bunker to record episodes of The Podkeast and also to meditate and prepare myself for the eventual interview. Luckily, it’s soundproof. That brought up another issue, though: if I can’t hear anything, how will I know when Mike (that’s what I call him in my head sometimes) has arrived?
That’s where The Lynx 1080P Camera comes in! The quality’s great, they’re easy to set up, there’s free cloud storage, and most importantly, it has facial recognition. Using photos, I trained mine to only recognize one face: Michael Keaton’s. Thus, I’ll get a check-in notification whenever he arrives (fingers crossed, any day now!). Any other unfamiliar face alerts that come through I just ignore, because like I said, I don’t need the distractions.
I should say: I do have two complaints. One is that the Lynx recognizes faces really well, but not always the material said faces are made of. What I’m getting at is that my mom keeps showing up in a really realistic Michael Keaton mask (she probably bought it with the start-up money I gave her, ugh!). She always says the same thing: that she’s worried I might be losing my mind. It makes me want to scream. Like, of course I’m losing my mind! I got a check-in notification and thought Michael Friggin’ Keaton was here! And sometimes I do scream. Hey, it’s a sound-proof bunker, gotta get your money’s worth, right?
The other complaint I have is that Michael Keaton has not shown up to do the interview with me. This is probably more a don’t-have-Michael-Keaton’s-contact-info problem than a Lynx problem, but still: with that AND the mask issue, I didn’t feel right giving it five stars.
Overall, though, a very good camera!"	0.05			2018-09-24T04:00:11.601Z	0.2044531578210335	0.94	74861

When it comes to celebrating milestones, different people demand different amounts of ceremony. Some will require you to wear tuxedos and dinner gowns to the their wedding in a restored factory-turned-theater-space, wherein they will prepare a choreographed song and dance commemorating the various defining moments of their relationship. Others will go to the courthouse, sign a few documents, and send a text imploring you to meet them for beers later.
Whether it be a birthday, a successful defense of a PhD dissertation, or a housewarming party–everyone’s a little different. Not everyone wants gifts. But herein lies the one consistent rule, regardless of an event’s formality: if you’re bringing a gift, you have to put it in something festive. Because even the most casual soon-to-be mom isn’t going to stoked when you show up with a onesie still in the shipping box from VintageOnsiesRUs․com.
The problem? Wrapping is stressful. Wrap a gift poorly and you look like a degenerate. Wrap a gift too ornately and you seem like a bit of an over-achiever. Besides, not everything is easy to wrap. If you want to wrap an overstuffed plush starfish, you can either a) put it in a box and wrap that, or b) get your friend who’s an aerospace engineer to help you get the measurements and scissor placement just right so that it doesn’t come out looking like garbage.
Really, your best bet is to put that overstuffed plush starfish into a gift bag. Because the gift bag always looks good. It’s as fun-looking as wrapping paper and as easy as a shipping box. Plus, getting a gift in a gift bag rules. You’re basically getting two gifts, one of which you’re more than encouraged to regift later when you need to give someone else a gift.

You’ll notice that you have two choices on today’s sale. One is reasonable. The other is unreasonable. Or should we say: the other is an UNREASONABLY GOOD DEAL! You know what that means. It’s the return of:
ORDER/HOARDER
For those are unfamiliar, Order/Hoarder is when we offer you two options: a normal number of things for a good price, or an abnormally large number of things for a GREAT price. Today’s product:
Cooling towels!!!
So, let’s break it down:
The Math
“You can’t put a price on cool.” That’s something someone said in a movie once. It doesn’t matter who or what movie or if I just made it up, because it’s not true. You can put a price on being cool.
For example, if you just want to be double-cool (as in, get two cooling towels) you have to pay $12. That comes down to the totally reasonable per towel price of $6 (especially considering they’re $10 over on Amazon).
Now, here’s where it gets a bit more complicated. As we like to point out on these sales, when figuring out the price per unit of the Hoarder order, it’s not as simple as dividing the overall price ($36) by the number of units (12). BECAUSE, your can choose either 2 or 12, no in-betweens. Therefore, if you think about it, you’re already paying $6 for each of the first 2 towels, which means the last 10 towels are only costing you $24, or a mere $2.40 per towel! How about that deal, huh?!
What you can do with a normal order
It’s pretty simple. Cooling towels are not exactly all that, well, cool, but they are functional. With just two of them, you can use one as your main post-workout cool-down towel, and give the other to your spouse or partner. Or you can cycle through both yourself so you don’t have to do laundry as often.
What can you do with a Hoarder order
So much more! Here are just a few suggestions:


Go a day early and leave a cooling towel at each mile marker of your upcoming 20K race, so you never have to worry about getting too hot.


Take all of them and fashion them into a suit or cocktail dress to wear to outdoor weddings. But would a suit or dress made out of cooling towels really be classy enough for something like that? you might ask. To which we would respond: Could it be any less classy than a suit or dress soaked with sweat?


Sure, you could spend a bunch of money on an air conditioner and then a bunch of more money each month to run it. Or, you could save some cash by sewing yourself a delightful cooling towel quilt!


They’d make a great napkin alternative at your 12-guest “super spicy food banquet”.


Are you a do-gooder teen? Do you often dream of fashioning rope ladders out of clothes and blankets to lower yourself out your 2nd story bedroom window so you can run around after bedtime with your new rebellious friends? Only, your palms get so sweaty that you can’t get a good grip? Gosh, if only you could make a rope ladder out of something cool and soothing to the touch!


See? Maybe we were wrong. Maybe 12 cooling towels isn’t an unreasonable amount of cooling towels at all. On the other hand, you still have the option of buying the (completely boring) 2-pack. The decision is yours!

So again, we have no complaints about this particular karaoke system. Our complaint is about karaoke in general, or, to be more specific, about the musical artists we so often choose NOT to sing. That’s right: I’m talking about birds. Despite being nature’s original songwriters, you rarely hear anyone at a karaoke night sing a song by the many great bird-fronted musical groups out there, such as:

Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a child. Let’s call him @Dave. Dave wore Sears-brand Toughskin jeans. They were, as their name implied, durable and long-lasting. But, like most economically practical things, corners needed to be cut to keep them affordable, and, unfortunately for Dave, the corner Toughskin jeans cut was the let’s-make-these-things-look-cool corner.
Or maybe not unfortunately. Because Dave rarely felt self-conscious in his Toughskin jeans. What did make him feel self-conscious was when, in the mid-80s, his grandparents splurged and got him a Generra sweatshirt. It was “in.” Very “in.” In fact, you could say that it was so deeply “in” that the brand couldn’t find its way out of the decade.
Suddenly, all the other kids at school were stopping Dave in the hallway to say, “Cool sweatshirt,” and, after years of remaining invisible behind the Toughskin curtain, he didn’t know how to react to such a compliment. It was uncomfortable.
Dave has come a long way since then… or has he? No, he doesn’t wear Toughskin jeans anymore, but he still has a Toughskin mindset. He’s not afraid of bright purple laptops or speakers that are loud in both function and design. This, in some ways, is his calling: espousing the virtues of things that don’t look exactly like you’d hope but work just fine.
But he doesn’t exactly know what to do with these slick-looking Rowkin Bluetooth Ear Buds.
Does he say: just because Meh sells some stuff that has substance but lacks style does NOT mean the stylish stuff we sell lacks substance in equal measure? Does he point out that many of the negative reviews on Amazon that have driven the average rating down to an unimpressive 3 stars can be put into 3 categories:

people complaining about the hefty (non-Meh) price tag;
people who struggled with a weird issue that was corrected easily by a factory reset; and
people hating on Bluetooth technology as a whole?

Does he mention that many reviews were impressed with both their size and sound quality (and again, that those people were reviewing after, presumably, paying some 50 bucks more the price they are offered at here)?
No. @Dave does none of these things. He has a copywriter do it, duh."	0.05			2018-09-20T04:00:02.850Z	0.2538143856831479	0.92	72743

As we’ve mentioned before, we recently won an auction for a storage locker that was filled entirely with branded content romance novels. Or so we thought. But, picking through the titles, we actually found many belonged to a branded content epic fantasy series by the author L.L.R. Holdien about a warrior named Tarklaw The Powerful. Luckily for us, there’s a chapter in book 19 about today’s product, the Keysmart (and Keysmart Pro).

Having successfully freed the shape-shifting wizard Vintel, son of Filor The Great, from the floating prison of Delkabana, narrowly escaping the light-spears of the Meschlen Guards by leaping through a portal leading somewhere that only a seer like Wise Crin might intuit–Tarklaw found himself deposited into murky waist-high water.
“Vintel?” Tarklaw called out, trying to locate the wizard whom he had just a moment ago saved, despite their families’ centuries-long acrimonious relations.
“I’m right here, Tarklaw,” Vintel seemed to whisper into his ear, buzzingly. “As a shape-shifting wizard, it is my custom to acclimate my shape to the environs, and so I have taken the form a mosquito because we, bitter-family-enemy-turned-savior, appear to be in a swamp.”
“Not just any swamp! The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors!” came a voice that belonged neither to Tarklaw or Vintel, but another in their vicinity. Tarklaw turned quickly, drawing his great sword with a shing sound common of sword-drawing. But he found only a small creature not unlike an unshelled tortoise, swimming towards them. “Forgive me for startling you! I am Rewn, peaceful leader of the Melorians, the primary inhabitants of this swamp at the edge of the Planet Glor at the far reaches of the Heplan Galaxy. Now, I imagine you’ve come here through some pesky portal or other, but fear not: your exit is easily made through one of the Eight Astounding Doors.”
“Doors?” Said Tarklaw. “I am from the planet Phentalon, a place without doors, due to our peoples’ openness with each other.”
“Very noble,” Rewn said. “Perhaps one day, The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors shall be like that. For now, you must choose one. They go to any number of worlds, from the euphorically beautiful mountain-scape of Relan to the hellish fire-deserts of Dumask. And we have all the keys right here…” Rewn dipped under the water for a moment, but re-emerged with a perplexed look upon his creaturely face. “Oh, dear! They were right there a moment ago.”
“You simply allow all keys to be strewn throughout a swamp?” buzzed Vintel.
“Not exactly,” Rewn said, explanatorily. “We keep them all together using an ingenious contraption known as a KeySmart. Made of aircraft aluminum, it can hold eight keys–or as many as fourteen, with an expansion pack! Additionally, it includes a loop for keys belonging to vehicles propelled by motors. Not to mention, its extended frame can hold long or foreign keys, which is especially important to us, as one of our oldest and most prized keys is made from the hollow bird-like finger bone of the fallen Hilderan Mage Lazlorn.”
“But,” Vintel buzzed, contrarily, “as ingenious and organizationally optimized as that all sounds, it seems at present not to be helping in your ability to locate them.”
“Ah, yes, that would be true if it were the base model, which is still good,” Rewn said. “Luckily for us, we opted for the Pro. Not only does it have a built-in LED flashlight and bottle opener; it can also show a map of your missing keys, and by way of the Tile app–which can be accessed via your smartphone or tablet–you can make your keys ring out loud! Of course, I should add at this juncture that the ‘water’ here in the The Gildera Swamp of Many Doors is different in elemental makeup to that of the water on other planets, such as Earth.”
“Are you saying,” Vintel buzzed, clarifyingly, “that just because we are discussing the KeySmart Pro being used in a water-based situation, it should not be taken as an endorsement of it being waterproof?”
“Exactly,” cried Rewn, disclaimingly.
“Much like doors, smartphones and tablets are concepts foreign to my home world,” Tarklaw said. “But that sounds like a great functional product nonetheless.”
“And I will show you just how functional it is!” Rewn cried with excitement. He brought forward a device and opened the Tile app. A moment later, a ding rang out, though it sounded muffled. The three of them turned… and stood facing a giant glowing snake-like beast. It emerged from the water, standing nearly forty Glorian theltans tall, or forty feet tall in Earth measurements, Glorian theltans being exactly equal to terrestrial feet. The ding sounded again, from somewhere deep inside of the monster’s abdomen.
“Oh no! A Mirelord! Run!” Rewn cried with fear. “Or, better yet, swim.” And with that, he disappeared under the water.
But Tarklaw did not swim away. He crouched into a combat ready position as best he could in the deep murky water. The Mirelord leaned closer to him, its eyes alight with evil.
“What are you doing?” buzzed Vintel into his ear, questioningly.
“We must get out of this swamp,” Tarklaw cried. “This is the only way. Though, it will be hard for just the two of us to defeat it…”
“Perhaps, I can help?” came a distinguished voice from Tarklaw’s side.
Tarklaw turned, and saw… no! He couldn’t believe it! “Hinton, son of Raquille, wielder of The Great Axe Of Orlagos, and best friend since birth of Tarklaw The Powerful? But I thought you were–”
“The immortal prisoner of the Inter-dimensional Pirate Lop, locked away in the his ship, The Pummeling Ewlok, for all of eternity?” Hinton laughed. “Not a chance in Dumask, my friend! Now, what do you say we free the aforementioned product from the belly of the beast? Just like old times?”
Tarklaw couldn’t help but smile. “Just like old times, indeed,” he said, and they raised their weapons to the approaching Mirelord."	0.05			2018-09-19T04:00:10.856Z	0.34612555704581827	0.93	72268

One time, I left without remembering to close the door.
I was living in a house somewhere so rural we didn’t need to lock up, and, in a rush to leave (I was going on a trip), I forgot to swing the door all the way closed, leaving only the screen door between my cat and freedom. He was fine. My mom checked on him the next day and, much to her surprise, he emerged from under the deck after spending what must’ve been, for an indoor cat, a terrifying night outside.
Just about every time I have left the house since then, even if just for an hour, I have wondered: “did I close the door? Did I lock the door? Do the pets have food? Do they have water? Did I leave the oven on? Did I unconsciously light seven candles and place them precariously close to window curtains that are, unbeknownst to me, highly flammable?” Many times, I have gone back to check. Never have I left the stove on. Never have I found candles flickering. The pets have always been fine. Only once or twice have I found the door unlocked.
Still, I never regret it, because it’s nicer to know everything’s fine than it is to hope everything’s fine.
And that’s really what these Zmodo MeShare cameras are for: making sure. You can call them “security cameras,” but that feels a little overstated. Maybe it would be better to rebrand them as “check-in cameras.” After all, the chances that you’re going to tune in as your home is being burglarized–thus allowing you to call the authorities while the burglary is in progress–is very low. I mean, hell, the actual likeliness of your home being burglarized at all is very low. And if your first thought upon reading that is, Nuh-uh, my home gets broken into all the time, we won’t argue with you. But we will say: you probably need more than a couple Zmodos.
Otherwise, these are a good option for the second-guessers out there to quell all the concerns that might flare up during your day at work: whether you just want to make sure everything’s fine, or to check that you didn’t forget to close the windows, or to monitor whether your dog is feeling okay after eating something stupid that he wasn’t supposed to…

So, the first thing you need to know is that these are little. They’re for kids or pets, not full-sized adults. So if you’re looking for sectional solution for game day with your buddies: this is no good… unless you’re, like, 10 and so are all your buddies (in which case, make sure you ask your parents before you buy this thing, okay? See! We’re responsible!)
The second thing you need to know is that the backs velcro on, and the seats have magnets in them, which makes them “infinitely configurable.” And yet, if that’s the case, then why is are these proposed layouts so BORING?! They’re mostly just couches. Where’s the fun in that? Why not try something more exciting, like these three designs:
You’re Number One

Will anyone even see that it’s a #1? Probably not. Is it really a practical way to lay out a room? No. But the subliminal reassurance that the design will provide for your child is massive. Every time they sit down they’ll think, “Hey, you know what: I’m special!” And this confidence will push them to do great things.
Game Room

Checkers is simple and boring on a board… but what about in a room, with you and all of your friends as the pieces? To make it more exciting: institute a rule where it’s not as easy as just “jumping” another piece; instead, you have to battle for it. Whoever doesn’t get cast into one of the empty spaces (i.e. onto the floor) wins!
Soft Kitchen

Okay, this isn’t exactly innovative, design-wise. But in terms of utility? Think about it: you cover the floor of your kitchen, wall-to-wall, with Sactionals, and now, suddenly, you can drop a glass or a ceramic mug and it won’t shatter! Plus, they’re machine washable, in case there’s a spill. Best of all, if you need to keep an eye on something you’ve got baking, you can just lay down next to the oven and watch it! What could go wrong?!
See! They don’t just need to be boring sectional couches! They can be ANYTHING YOU WANT! In fact, please: post your ideas for how to lay out these Lovesac Modular Sactionals in the comments!"	0.05			2018-09-17T04:00:07.170Z	0.30279148865568856	0.94	75712			0.031800019356533524

A cheers to grilling out (because it is literally the only way to cook in the summer, as running the oven, or even just the stovetop, will turn your house into the planet Venus, so that simply making a quiche in August results in the same volume of sweat as a five mile run any other time of year)!


A cheers to swimming (whether you do it in the ocean, or in a lake, or in a river, or in a pool, or just by taking your dog for a walk through the air that is thicker than many nut butter varieties)!


A cheers to the sun (which, upon revealing itself, around a bend in the highway, will show you just how little you clean the inside of your windshield)!


A cheers to vacation (which is defined as a trip that occurs when someone, delirious from the heat, begins to think, you know what I bet would be great? Spending hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to go somewhere that is even hotter than it is here and completely overrun with people in Hawaiian shirts seeking sand and mini golf)!

Dear @reclaimercube,
On September 2nd, you posted the following comment on a knife sale:

Meh I have anxiously been awaiting for you to post a toothbrush for sale again. I will post this everyday until you finally sell another one again.

And, @reclaimercube, can we tell you something? We’re very proud of you. Because you kept your word. Since then, each day, you’ve put forward this same request.
Your fellow Meh customers began to notice. One post from Friday, September 7th sparked a discussion that involved more than 20 comments. In that conversation, someone pointed out a toothbrush for sale on a competitor’s site. You, ever strong, refused to take the bait:

not a bad deal… But not on meh so it doesn’t matter. You could link me to colgate’s website or crest’s website for a free toothbrush and I still wouldn’t want it unless it was on meh. I’m chaining myself to this statue. Ride or die mehbrother.

Your repeated request did not specify why you wanted a toothbrush, or what kind of toothbrush you wanted. Really, you haven’t even promised that you’d buy the toothbrush. You’ve only asked, repeatedly, for us to “post a toothbrush.”
Well, good news, @reclaimercube: when we launched Meh, we made a decision. Once, and only once, we would allow a Meh customer to dictate exactly what we’d sell. The only rule was they had to make the request for 13 consecutive days. They could ask for $1 MacBooks, or free puppies, or Cadillac Escalades filled with cash. It didn’t matter. There were no restrictions, aside from the 13 days. Some of us worried the financial hit would be too much, but others felt assured: we could trust our customers! They wouldn’t make unreasonable demands!
So thank you, @reclaimercube; you’ve shown us that our faith was not misplaced. Now, Meh community, let’s all come together and celebrate with this build-your-own-bundle of toothbrushes.
Sincerely,
Meh

Hair: it is the ultimate example of disobedience.
You can train puppies to pee outside, to walk next to you, to sit, to shake, to do any number of fun and/or useful things. With cats, the job is much harder, but with some persistence (and a spray bottle) it is possible to enforce a few rules: you do not yowl in the middle of the night, you do not walk on the kitchen counter, you do not knock our decorative trinkets off the mantle as a game. Even a bonsai can be coaxed, over time, to grow a certain way.
But not hair. Nope, no matter how many times you comb, shave, style, epilate, and wax: it can just never take the fucking hint!
You know that person in your  your life who’s like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “hmm, maybe?” And you hope they’ll just drop it, but then a day later, they’re like, “Hey, let’s do this dumb thing,” and you’re like, “I don’t know if that dumb thing is really a good idea.” Which should be clear as hell, but they don’t want to listen, so they keep prodding and prodding until you’re like, “Look,  I don’t want to do the dumb thing because it is dumb, and honestly, I’m worried you might be dumb for suggesting it, and I might be dumb for being the friend of such a dumb person.” And you feel terrible but they just smile and say, “C’mon! It’ll be great!”
That’s hair. No matter how many times you try to send the message that you don’t want it to come back there, it keeps coming back there. It is untrainable!
Or is that the wrong way to look at it? Could it be that we are the untrainable ones? That our hair is not being a stubborn learner but a tenacious teacher? That it wants to lead us to a better place? A place where we eschew the standards of beauty thrust upon us? Because isn’t it pretty arbitrary where we say there should be hair and where we say there should not? On the head is good, but not on the face? Except some faces capable of growing thick enough hair? On the chest is okay, but no, never on the back? Not on the legs, but okay on the arms, except in the armpits? Could it be that our hair’s persistence is its way of saying: you need to get the hell over it and just be who you are?

Use it to sous vide. Use it to keep your hops fresh before brewing. Use it to keep your weed fresh before… HANDING IT OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES, OBVIOUSLY.
Maybe even use it to keep your food fresher longer. That’s called outside-the-bag thinking.

The three brothers had been cleaning out their grandfather’s basement for nearly two hours before they found the FoodSaver.
“What’s this?” said Kyle, holding it up.
“Looks old,” said Jake. “I’d guess circa second half of the 2010’s.”
Terry took it from Kyle and inspected it. “Wait, I know these things. It’s an early model weed-sealer. You know? The devices for vacuum-packing weed so it wouldn’t go bad.”
“All this talk of weed remind me, have you guys taken your three o’clock edibles yet?” Jake asked.
Kyle and Terry nodded.
“But wait,” Kyle said, “why does it say FoodSaver on it, if it’s for weed?”
“You have to understand, Kyle, this was before weed was legal everywhere,” Terry explained. “They didn’t even put it in the water back then!”
Kyle looked at the FoodSaver perplexed. “Really?”
“I’m serious,” Terry said. “So people weren’t as acclimated to it as we are now. They considered it a drug. Thus, when people took some, they got ‘high,’ which basically meant they thought without logic. So it’s likely that the inventor of the ‘FoodSaver’ only named it such because he was super high, and probably pretty hungry.”
“So strange to think that the same substance that keeps us calm and measured, used to have almost the opposite effect!” Kyle said.
Now Jake had the FoodSaver. “Are you sure this is a weed-sealer? To me, it looks like an early sous-vide-assistant. That would make more sense with the FoodSaver name.”
“Did they even sous vide back then?” Terry asked.
“Sure,” Jake said. “It was more of a luxury, though, given that it was before the Microwave And Oven Act of 2035.”
“When I read about those times, and all the negative-energy-pollution caused by those now illegal kitchen appliances, it just makes me sick,” Terry said.
“Guys, you’ve got me thinking…” Kyle paused to gather his thoughts. “Well, you know how when we put stuff in the freezer, it just freezes together and gets covered in weird ice?”
“They’re called water diamonds, Kyle,” Terry said.
“They mean the moisture has accepted the food, so we know it’s safe to eat,” Jake said.
“I’m well aware of them and what they mean. Don’t forget, I’m the one who studied health at Dove For Men Presents: College. But I was thinking, the food doesn’t always taste good after the water diamonds form.” Kyle took the FoodSaver from Jake. “And I know this is going to sound crazy, but if this thing could keep weed fresh, and be used with food products for sous-vide purposes, maybe we could combine the two functions. Like, we could use it to seal food before we freeze it so it stays fresher longer.”
“You mean, you want to eat food that’s been frozen but hasn’t emitted its proper water diamonds?” Terry said.
“Isn’t that illegal?” Jake added.
“Sure, on Earth. But not here,” Kyle said, “on Mars.”
Jake and Terry had to admit he had a point: they definitely had been on Mars this whole time."	0.05			2018-09-13T04:00:05.184Z	0.21097046413502127	0.92	62121
